        "description": "Terrorist attacks. Natural disasters. Domestic crackdowns. Economic collapse. Riots. Wars. Disease. Starvation. What can you do when it all hits the fan? You can learn to be self-sufficient and survive without the system. **I've started to look at the world through apocalypse eyes.** So begins Neil Strauss's harrowing new book: his first full-length worksince the international bestseller The Game, and one of the most original-and provocative-narratives of the year. After the last few years of violence and terror, of ethnic and religious hatred, of tsunamis and hurricanes\u2013and now of world financial meltdown\u2013Strauss, like most of his generation, came to the sobering realization that, even in America, anything can happen. But rather than watch helplessly, he decided to do something about it. And so he spent three years traveling through a country that's lost its sense of safety, equipping himself with the tools necessary to save himself and his loved ones from an uncertain future. With the same quick wit and eye for cultural trends that marked The Game, The Dirt, and How to Make Love Like a Porn Star, Emergency traces Neil's white-knuckled journey through today's heart of darkness, as he sets out to move his life offshore, test his skills in the wild, and remake himself as a gun-toting, plane-flying, government-defying survivor. It's a tale of paranoid fantasies and crippling doubts, of shady lawyers and dangerous cult leaders, of billionaire gun nuts and survivalist superheroes, of weirdos, heroes, and ordinary citizens going off the grid. It's one man's story of a dangerous world\u2013and how to stay alive in it. Before the next disaster strikes, you're going to want to read this book. And you'll want to do everything it suggests. Because tomorrow doesn't come with a guarantee...",

            "The books of George V. Higgins are, I suspect, an acquired taste. They are considered by many readers to be too difficult because there is no straight forward narration and because so much of the books are made up of dialogue - or more often, long monologues. The plot emerges slowly from what the characters say. A reader who is in a hurry to be engaged in the story is likely to be disappointed. But for those who have grown to love Higgins's ear for vernacular and the peculiarities of ordinary speech, all of his books are treasures that can be savored slowly for the richness of the language alone.At End of Day is the story of an unholy alliance between two members of the Boston mob and a select group of FBI agents whose careers have been made successful through information these mobsters have provided about their Mafia counterparts. The FBI, in turn, has protected these men from prosecution which has allowed them to even commit murder with impunity (though this is &quot;against the rules&quot;). This tale is all the more interesting because it is based on a true story.It is a shame that this is the last Higgins book we will have. He died as it was going to press. On the positive side, he wrote so many books during his career that fans of his style should have no trouble finding something to satisfy that acquired taste.",
            "would be an appropriate subtitle for this roman a clef wherein Whitey, Steve &quot;the Rifleman&quot; Flemmi, notorious FBI agent John Connally and their circle get the classic Higgins treatment. Once again the soliloquies are the star attraction, full of Higginsian rifts and rants, ribald, vulgar, always shrewd and sometimes wise, but always lush of language, on the thousand and one shocks that make getting through the day such an difficult and unrewarding task. While its true all the characters talk in the same patois (even the woman talk out of the side of their mouths) you grant Higgins the indulgence so absorbing are these blue collar monologues. Updike speaking through the mouth of Rabbit is the closest comparison I can think of.Sadly, this was Higgins valediction, so it is appropriate that it is such a Boston story; for nobody delineated the world of hoodlum Beantown these last thirty years like George V. Higgins. Like all the best, he created a world, and for all the sordidness and cynicism animating it, it was not without its charms: in his wonderful novels the pen does prove mightier than the sawed-off shotgun.",
            "The sad death of George V Higgins means this will be his last book. It is certainly one to remember. Readers new to Higgins will at first find his style somewhat &quot;difficult&quot;: his novels centre on the criminals, law enforcement agents and politicians (they are usually amusingly similar) of Boston, but instead of the usual descriptive narrative, the plot unfolds through the conversations of people often only tangentially concerned with its developement. Once one gets used to this digressive way of telling a story one quickly becomes engrossed in the story he is relating: in this case, the disturbingly close relationship between Boston's chief FBI agents and two leaders of organised crime in the city (apparantly based on a real case). I have to confess to being slightly disappointed with some of Higgins' most recent works (although they are still better than most &quot;crime&quot; fiction), but this last novel is brilliant; I know it is a cliche, but I could not put it down. One is genuinely engaged by the diverse and acutely drawn characters, though Higgins cleverly constantly reminds us that behind their apparant good-nature and charm, most of them are really either cold-blooded loan sharks who have no compunction in using extreme violence to maintain their way of life, or law enforcement officials (and their families) with a somewhat ambivalent attitude to the law they are supposed to be enforcing! As with most of Higgins' novels, I immediately went back and re-read it, and of course saw things I had missed first time: you certainly get good value out of his books. I would class this as one of his best, and it is very sad to think that there will not be any more. It is my intention to go back and read every one of this excellant author's magnificent contribution to modern American literature (and, I contend, he is far too good a writer to be &quot;ghettoised&quot; in 'crime fiction'.)Readers new to George V Higgins would find &quot;At End Of Day&quot; a good place to start, those who know what to expect will not be at all disappointed. My advice is READ IT!",
            "I read &quot;At End of Day&quot; in honor of Higgins's passing. In a (perhaps not so) strange coincidence, it deals with exactly the same topic (shady symbiotic alliance between FBI agents and two Boston organized crime figures) as the recent and highly touted non-fiction book &quot;Black Mass&quot; (apologies for forgetting the authors). While not GVH's best novel (even among the recent ones, I prefer &quot;The Agent&quot;), I found it much more enjoyable than the disappointing &quot;Black Mass&quot;. One slight cavil, possibly attributable to various rush factors: AEoD is not as well-edited as other GVH books, with a variety of typos and misspellings. Maybe not for Higgins newcomers, but recommended to fans of his Boston crime work, and anyone who's read &quot;Black Mass&quot; ought to check it out for a different approach.",
            "George V. Higgins' &quot;At End of Day&quot; is reminiscent of the work of KC Constantine, with its wonderful addiction to dialogue. I have not read &quot;The friends of Eddie Coyle&quot;, but it is next on my list. AEoD is a long trip through the lives of two FBI agents and two gangsters,who, while they do work together, are not buddies,least of all Arthur McKeon(the treacherous McKeach).GVH's chracters seem to deliver Shakespeare length monologues, but they never become tiresome. Some readers may wonder where the action is, but when you read Higgins' vivid description of McKeach beating a potential business rival,you'll be glad the violence is kept to a minimum. Every character could be a living,breathing person(and some are, this is based on a true story) and there are about three novels' worth of conversation in this book. I enjoyed every line (twice, 'cause I relly had to read it twice for understanding!). A beautiful end to what I hope was a killer career",
            "Higgins is one of my favorites, end of story. If he has to be categorized as a \"crime writer\", there are 4 or 5 of his classics that rate as the best ever (Eddie Coyle, Digger's Game, Cogan's Trade, etc.).At End of Day was Higgins playing off the FBI/Whitey Bulger fiasco. It wasn't his best effort, but it was close enough for jazz to rate way about the rest of the field. There are a few books of his I couldn't get through (or had to fight my way through--much like James Ellroy's Cold Six Thousand--just couldn't get through it). End of Day isn't one of them. He left us with a beauty.",
            "First of all, I loved The Friends of Eddie Coyle. It's a brilliant book. But with all his subsequent books, the singular dialog magic of that book falls apart to varying degrees. Cogan's Trade. Digger's Game. The Jerry Kennedy books. The dialog that drives the plot so completely just isn't the same. Or, maybe it's more accurate to say that it's too much the same. I never once found myself, in reading TFoEC, checking to see who was the speaker. You knew. It was Eddie or the gun runner or the cop or Dillon. But in the other books I find myself having to check. Part of the reason is that Higgins simply doesn't differentiate the way that different people speak. This is false. Not every speaker in a group says \"inna\" and \"onna\" every single damn time. Even in groups of people of largely similar education and intelligence there will always be some people using correct enunciation a little more than others. Not in GVHworld. Inna. Onna. Inna. Onna.Maybe I'm just wrong about the world of criminals. I doubt it. I've hung around with some pretty lowbrow folks and there's always variation in accent and enunciation. Not in GVHworld. This falseness starts to seem a little bit less like authenticity and a little bit like condescension after a while. Well, they're hoods so they never talk right. Really? Never? I'm not buying it. This isn't a bad book. And TFoEC is a terrific book. But the dialog that's the core of this book big rings slightly false and not authentic. Human beings have more variation in speech than GVH depicts.",
            "I am extremely pleased with the service I received from Magnolia-Avenue. The product was as described-in excellent condition and delivered promptly. I will deal exclusively with this vendor whenever possible.",
            "A great fan of Higgins, I have read many of his books many times. Perhaps he didn't have time to polish At the End of Day, perhaps it was pushed because he died. It's just not very good. The dialogue doesn't work, the Bulger/Flemmi theme is overplayed, and if it weren't by Higgins it would have sunk like a stone. And no matter what conventional {ab}usage allows, the old Higgins would never have used \"gunsel\" to describe a gunman.",
            "I'm still working through this book. I loved the Friends of Eddy Coyle, but as a follow-up, this is less engaging, more of a slog. About halfway through it, I realized, as did another reviewer, that what this book is really about is the way the Boston FBI managed to justify (to itself) keeping the murderous multiple felon Whitey Bulger active, and allowing him to get away with whatever he wanted to do. That arrangement has never been described in detail that I'm aware of. So here is Higgins' take on how the twisted ambitions of the FBI agents and the twisted characters they needed to deal with could have yielded up a situation like Whitey Bulger. And it's worth noting that the book is almost entirely not only in dialogue, but in *dialect*. Page after page of characters either talking or thinking. Very little action, but when it happens, it's convincing.",
            "George V. Higgins' reputation has gradually grown from &quot;brilliant crime novelist&quot; since his THE FRIENDS OF EDDIE COYLE to &quot;one of the great American novelists.&quot; AT END OF DAY is his last book and his best. The brilliant Boston-based dialogue, which drives the story unlike the dialogue of any other writer, peaks here in a novel based on some true events.",
            "The item we received is as advertised. Book is in the usual excellant condition. I suspect but cannot prove that the quality of the writing on Higgin's last book was negatively influenced by his health. He is generally the best practioner of Dialog is plot; plot is dialog but in this case his plot lacks cohesion. It is there but there are to many side stories that do not connect as solidly as is the usual case. But he is still one of the best in the business at descripting and depicting the cheap, venial, smelly underworld of Boston. If you read this, read everything else he wrote. When he is on his feed, there is no one better.",
            "At End Of Day takes far more effort to read than a traditional novel packed with action scenes, and/or tied together neatly through the perspective of a narrator. Chapters alternate with two mob informants reminiscing about their own careers and about the guys they're having to set on fire and maim to persuade them to pay their loans on time. These conversations ramble on and on, over and over. The heavy New England dialect is frustrating to interpret. Finally, these aimless conversations come together to reveal an alliance between the FBI and the mob--I guess this plot twist is supposed to surprise the reader? Poorly developed characters and the dialog technique employed here make this a difficult read."

We found ourselves completely spellbound as the of adventure unfolded.The story is well-researched and beautifully written. Readers will find it satisfies the intellect and emotions at once as it is both educationally nourishing and a suspenseful page-turner. It follows two teens, an Afganistani boy and an American girl through the life-transforming time of 9/11. It explores cultural values, alternatives to violence, and examines how we define such things as bravery and family.We most highly recommend this book, especially at this time, when compassionate communication, empathy and widening perspectives are crucial.",

Three cheers for Stine's ability to craft a story of hope in this fractured world.",

Dawn is a foster child runaway caught in New York City on the fateful day of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. Johar is a poet fleeing the terrible armies of the Taliban in Afghanistan. How their lives find a way to touch is the heart of this novel.It is hard to believe this is a first book. I love the way this author draws such different worlds with such compelling, sensual detail. Dawn's internal emotional struggle is depicted with restraint and realism. Johar's collapsing world is at once exciting and heart breaking. All in all, this is a great book with wonderful characters and a lively story, and will be appreciated by people of all ages. Highly recommended.",

It is a great novel for those who seek readings that stimulate the mind and intellect. I must confess I wasn't thrilled with the theme of the book (as I said, this subject has been over done in a lot of different ways).

It is one of the best series I have ever read, and I am surprised it took so long to be picked up.It takes place in what could be considered a post apocalyptic age of man, but it is nothing like any other post apocalyptic manga out. It is filled with political intrigue, personal drama, and mind blowing plot arcs. The apocalyps is just the beginning and the canvas on which this story is painted.It follows the life of a boy, Elijah, and his travels through the unique anarchic landscape of a world ravaged by a plague known as the Closer virus. With an ensamble of friends of happenstance, vicious enemies, and mosters, Elijah's world is far from the biblical paradise of Eden.The author builds an array of interesting complicated characters, giving time to them as much as any main character, no matter how brief their life in the comic is. They are people for the most part real, aside from some who have been modified cybernetically.As far as the artistry of the graphic novel is concerned, it is precisely that, graphic. It is not a novel for children, and often attacks adult issues head on. Aside from that, the action scenes are dynamic representations of the climax, either emotional or physical, of that scene. No shortage of blood, and guts, but not so splattered across the page as to be considered obscene.These pictures are only there to support the myriad of plots, sub-plots, serializations and cliffhangers that are throughout the manga, as it heads toward an uncertain conclusion. There are twists turns and, growth, actual full fledged growth of the situations present, which become continually profound.Read this manga for its drama, its violence and its imagination, whose vision of a post apocalyptical world can only be described as human.",
            "Eden is an awesome manga. If any manga has achieved a literary state it has to be this one. For example, it doesn't exactly present characters the way other manga do, by showing what they look like, and having them act out in a way that would be characteristic. What Eden did in this volume was present the setting first, and have the characters interact with that setting. Being a post-apocalyptic tale, the setting is key, and having certain people react a certain way to the setting will reveal a lot about that character. Personally, I thought this was brilliantly done, and I felt that I knew Elijah, the main character, well enough to like him, even though he was only in three short chapters of this volume.The story in Eden--in this volume at least--begins with two teenagers, Enoah and Hannah, as they care for their guardian Layne, who's dying of a disease that hardens the skin and turns the insides of a human to mush. While caring for Layne, these kids learn of their responsibility to human-kind, as well as the tragic past that aided in bringing about the apocalypse in which they are living in. Later, the story moves to young Elijah, a boy whose only companion is a robot named Cherubim, as he goes about the everyday job of survival, including scavenging and hunting, as well as dreaming of girls.Though admittedly the story is slow, and very little is given away as to what direction Eden is heading in, I can't knock it for the simple brilliance in which it is unfolding. Hiroki Endo put an emphasis on presenting the stark setting and conditions of living in the volume, and also made it clear that it is an intelligent plot no matter how slow it is. The back cover states that Eden is \"a brilliant love song to post-apocalyptic survival genre\" and I would have to agree on that. Eden is a smart story rivaling even Akira, and one I highly recommend for fans of darker, smarter manga.",
            "Having read the first three volumes so far, I'm blown away. I haven't found a manga this engaging since Akira. At first glance, what appeared to be a typical \"post-apocalytic\" story is actually deeply fascinating on multiple levels, most especially characterization. The technological elements are as well done as anything by Shirow (Ghost in the Shell), perhaps even better, as they are more clearly explained and shown to be a logical extension of present-day technologies. The future the author has created here is totally coherent and convincing. Like the best sci-fi, you feel like you are simply glimpsing one aspect of an enormous world.The visual storytelling is extremely well done. The battle scenes are clearly sequenced and paced in a way that is very cinematic. I found myself racing from panel to panel, my eyes frequently bugging out at dramatic and gory moments that are perfectly presented in service to the larger narrative and the emotional content.The characters are quite convincing and engaging.This is a fantastic piece of entertainment!",
            "A worldwide plague has struck Earth, and there's no cure in sight. The disease is particularly nasty because your skin hardens into rock-like consistency and then your internal organs liquefy and drain out through your orifices! So you have all these statues of people laying around like so many victims of Medusa. A bio-dome named Eden is constructed under UN control to quarantine uninfected humans from the pandemic sweeping the world. Many years later, all that's left of the once hopeful experiment are two adolescents named Enoah and Hannah, who have genetic resistance, and their dying guardian Layne, who is rapidly succumbing to the sickness. The rest of this first volume fills you in on how Eden, which was once a bastion of Man's hopes, has now become an empty shell of its former self. We're also introduced to Cherubim, a military robot which Eden's now dead inhabitants blamed for their destruction. The second half of the book takes up a different thread, 20 years later as a young boy named Elijah, accompanied by Cherubim, fights to survive in the ruins of civilization.This first volume of Eden had it all: Sci-fi, Violence, love, human fears, religious symbolism, and realism. The characters at times feel like mythological, if not Biblical, figures given human shape, but they retain our sympathies. They are protagonists trying to live in a world that has been destroyed by forces on a different level than themselves. As in all times of chaos, factions arise to take advantage of the situation and take control. It's difficult to see how these characters are going to fit into the scheme of things. The little violence in this book is graphic but necessary to tell the story. Death isn't pretty. The art in Eden is some of the best I've ever seen in a manga and is reminescent of a more refined Ghost in the Shell style-wise. Video Girl Ai is another series that is similar in art. This is a gripping and thought provoking first volume in what looks to be a great series.",
            "All I have to say is that this series is by far the best manga/graphic novel I've ever read... This is not the plotless violence that you see in many manga series', Eden's story line is one of the better plots that I've read in quite some time. This series is absolutely incredible and a 'must-read' for everyone who loves... well... anything.",
            "Eden is simply an amazing graphic novel set in a world ravaged by a killer virus, that wipes out the majority of the population. We start with three survivors on an island. A dying man confined to a wheelchair and two children. From this simple begining we delve into complex subject matter. The concept of sin, sexual desire, explore the meaning of life, question the existence of god and man's role in the natural order. Heady stuff to say the least and then there are the mecha robots, cyborgs, mercenaries and global conspiracies. Breathtaking in it's scope and imagination, Hiroki Endo has created a tribute to the cyberpunk and post-apocalyptic survival genre.",
            "Eden Volume 1 is a great addition to the genre of post-apocalyptic literature. While the scenario of a government conspiracy-related pandemic is nothing new, Hiroki Endo's iteration in Volume 1 is worthwhile reading. This book's intricate plot and great character development give the series a strong start. This review comments on three elements of artwork: scenery, characters, and action. The review then discusses plot and storytelling. Finally, it concludes with brief thoughts on the overall series.The characters are drawn with distinctive features without resorting to over-the-top hair profiles and character designs, for which manga is known. The more subdued character design allows the artist to demonstrate the subtle deterioration in health over time, as the infection takes over a person's body. I believe this is one of the book's most distinctive visual characteristics.The artwork is superior to the average manga, with an emphasis on electronics and machinery in interior scenes. Exterior scenes show an interesting mixture of real-world places and architecture. The setting in first half of closely resembles Biosphere 2 in Arizona, while the cityscapes in the second half closely resemble Hong Kong (i.e. Lippo Center). Seeing these buildings somewhat confused me where the intended setting for this story is, but this is fiction after all! And the scenes are beautiful nonetheless.The characters are well developed. Endo successfully introduces a large cast, and is able to give each motivation and weaknesses without being stereotypical. Character development is excellent, and one of the best reasons to read this volume.Volume 1 has the most interesting plot of the Eden series, with big, visionary ideas and layers of conflict. The pacing is good with well-timed flashbacks, dialogue, and action. Each element purposely advances the story, unlike the gratuitous ultra-violence and raunchy sexual dialog of later volumes. Overall, this volume has great artwork and a compelling story--what more can be asked of a manga? I recommend Volume 1.***However, I do not recommend later volumes of Eden, where the overall series takes a bizarre tangential direction, losing Volume 1's focus of survival in a post-apocalyptic world. Every subsequent volume feels detached, like a different genre all together. Volumes 2 and 3 are simply futuristic war stories, with emphasis on brutality and mutilation. Volume 4 is a coming-of-age Yakuza story. Volume 5 is a ghost-in-the-machine story. Volumes 6 and 7 are street gang/drug cartel stories. And so on...I only mention these later volumes because they feel like completely different stories that simply reuse the same characters. Some of the later volumes are interesting in their own right, but together, the books begin to feel like schizophrenic, unfocused storytelling. While reading the later volumes, I got the impression that the original virus piece of the story becomes simply an excuse to explain the ridiculous cyborg-like weaponry implanted into the bodies of villain characters. I believe Eden's original premise of a pandemic-induced societal collapse is so powerful, but is wasted and eventually forgotten halfway through Volume 2."

I would suggest the kids series and the adult series to any child or adult who is looking for a great Christian Fiction series. These books helped me develop a better relationship with Christ.",
            "I have always enjoyed the adult series of Left Behind books. The kids books are just as good. The kids interact with the characters from the adult series, experience the same events, etc. However, since the main characters are teens, these books can appeal to younger readers. So far, the stories haven't had the ups and downs that the adult series has had. The adult series has books that are a lot more boring than others. The kids series seems to be good in every book. These are not for really young kids, but would be appropriate for young teens. I enjoy them and I am an adult.",

            "Gone With the Wind was captivating and enjoyable. When I was in the middle of this book, I was reccomending it to everyone I saw! Then I came to the ending. The ending was disappointing, sad, and flat. Who wants to be left hanging with a book this good? No one! I plan to read the sequel, Scarlett. I figure the story line can't get much worse than how it ended in Gone With the Wind. Read it once just for the experience. You probably won't want to read it again.",
            "Ugh -- By the end of this book, you're going to want to slap Scarlett silly. I'm angry that I wasted the past month of my life reading this book. Mitchell must have been getting paid by the word because she goes on and on and on about nothing. This book could have easily been 600 or 700 pages shorter. The romance between Rhett and Scarlett is not believable. A cold, drab book. Save yourself the agony: rent the movie.",
            "I have to admit one thing about this book. She got her Civil War facts right, which is more than we can say for some authors who have tried writing novels about the war. Other than that, I have nothing good to say about this book.Scarlett is one of the most annoying characters you'll ever read about. I realize she's supposed to be that way, but frankly I didn't care what happened to her or anybody else in this book. She got on my nerves right from the start.My biggest problem with the book was how racist it was. Critics of Mark Twain call his books racist, but Tom and Huck are probably accurate portrayals of kids growing up in that time and place (at least regarding their thoughts on slaves). To have Tom Sawyer make a comment that sounds racist to us is one thing, but in this case the author shows her own racism. A slave who came back south after visiting Boston with a Union officer complains about being expected to sit at the dinner table with the white people, who obviously didn't know that the black people were inferior and should eat in the kitchen. This was probably her view when she wrote it, but if you could go back in time I doubt if you'd have found any slaves who didn't want their freedom, or who didn't want to be treated as equals by the white people of the time.I've never understood the popularity of this book or the movie. If you want to read a good Civil War novel try something by Howard Bahr or \"The Killer Angels,\" or \"A Soldier's Book,\" or \"Enemy Women,\" or \"The Red Badge of Courage,\" or \"Shiloh.\"",
            "Along with D.W. Griffith's \"A Birth of a Nation,\" this nostalgic and wish-fulfilling \"riches-to-rags-and-back-to-riches-again\" romp across Civil War history is more than just the archetypical racist American novel. Together the two constitute a kind of sub-cultural \"power-duo,\" that captures perfectly the mindset that ushered-in a century of American Apartheid, and arguably that still governs much, if not most of American culture. \"Gone With the Wind\" is literally \"cotton candy\" for the Conservative/racist/Southern American mind.In the most syrupy and sophomoric of prose (perhaps ever written by an American author), Mitchell lays it on heavily. Scarlet, the archetypical southern bitch flaunts and wields her unearned entitlements with great immoral facility, demonstrating that even when down and out, \"being white\" still \"counts\" for more than anything else. Even when ravaged by the Northern Yankee soldiers, being a \"Southern white woman\" still demands royal treatment, and commands the regal stage always hovering well above and over all the lower animals, and especially, and most notably, over all the blacker ones.Let us admit it up front: Gone With the Wind is an important novel only because of its slightly transparent racist subtext, which still resonates with a large reservoir of American thought, habits, feelings and culture. And although the structure of racism, which the book appeals to, still remains pretty much intact and unperturbed, it is no longer respectable to acknowledge it, or most of all to speak of it in other than \"coded language.\"Griffith's movie, and Mitchell's book are perhaps the first \"coded\" version of racism that captured perfectly the American mindset, and thus are both valuable in this respect alone. It is in this sense only that Gone With the Wind is perhaps the best of this genre - eventually spawning the like's of John Jake's series on the North and South, etc.Meaning no disrespect, and noting that it won the Pulitzer Prize, being the best of this genre does not suggest that the book is being measured against a very high standard. But despite this and despite it's mean-spirited, amoral and wish fulfilling subtext, it is not easy to deny that this novel has earned its place in the pantheon of American history and literature. Since it remains such an important nostalgic representation of the racist American way of life, and is the best of its genre, it deserves at least four stars.",
            "Oh, crackle. The times are too and the heat is. This takes 100 pages for ANYTHING to happen. That's genius. I'd a never have the guts to do that until now. Know me and use me.

            "Hell, I just wasted the better part of my Sunday reading the last couple of hundred pages of this trash, always in the hope that somewhere, there had to be this twist which would make the book worth reading, but it just never came. I ended flinging the book across the room, disgusted. Character, heroism, intelligence, thoughtfulness? Things Scarlett certainly lacks can all be found in books like Inception (Harbinson) or even better: A Town like Alice (Shute). Please don't waste your time as I did....",
            "My father browbeat me into reading \"Gone With The Wind\" when I was a teenager. To this day I can't understand what all the fuss was about. Scarlet is such a spoilt snit that I couldn't care what happened to her. I guess this is one book you either love or hate, so I recommend that you check a volume out of the library and read a chapter or two. If you hate it, you've lost nothing but a little of your time. If you love it, well, there's no accounting for taste.",
            "Written during the Great Depression when Americans needed escapism, GWTW and the resulting movie it spawned are primarily responsible for distorting many Americans impressions of slavery, as well as trivializing the horror of the Civil War. If you like your history covered with moonlight and magnolias and sugar-coated beyond all reality GWTW is just what you are looking for. After all, its only fiction. Problem is, too many people over the years have come to regard it as almost gospel. In the end, GWTW is little more than a cheap attempt to create an American version of Tolstoy's &quot;War &amp; Peace.&quot;",
            "There is so much lip service paid to how good this book is, and how everyone should read it, and yadda yadda yadda.The prose is boring, way too purple and prosaic. It makes Soap Operas look realistic.None of this speaks to the fact that the whole book is RASCIST. The south was built on the backs of African-Americans, and they died to build the South up. They are still fighting for equality, and now we have some romantic idealization of the South, and Margaret Mitchell makes the Klan look like some good group of good ol' boys.I am disgusted that a book this blatently racist and snotty is still held up as a classic.",

I should have read the comments closer and I would have known it was not a hardback--in which case I would not have purchased it. I do not feel it will remain in good condition for long and I am worried that the binding may work loose with reading and also will not store well on my shelf. I do not understand why this book was not offered in a hardback edition, after all, I would think most people purchase them to add to their collections and plan to keep them for many years.",
            "The book actually provides a well-balanced explanation of southern attitudes and responses to the Civil War, reconstruction,their \"culture\",womens place in society and class consciousness among both blacks and whites.

Readers who are curious about the author Margaret Mitchell might be interested in reading her biography \"Road to Tara\" by Anne Edwards.",
            "Margaret Mitchell's \"Gone with the Wind\" is a mesmerizing novel. I saw the movie when I was young and disliked it immensely. Therefore, I never read the book until it was selected for a book club. With some trepidation, I began reading and was immediately plunged into a riveting tale.This epic concerns the headstrong Scarlett O'Hara, a southern belle who becomes embroiled in the Civil War and Reconstruction Era. It is a story of Scarlett's selfishness and also her courage. The story revolves around the tumultuous relationship that develops between Scarlett and Rhett Butler, an enigmatic, harsh, and pitiable man who recognizes within Scarlett a likeness to himself. However, Scarlett's unrequited love for a gentler man, Ashly Wilkes, proves to be astumbling block to her happiness. Her unrelenting quest to obtain money also causes her to make many enemies. Scarlett symbolizes the changing times, and she and Rhett are a perfect match. Ashley represents the \"old ways,\" and thus this story can be seen as a symbolic journey. Times change, and people must adapt in order to survive. Although I do not necessarily agree with \"survival of the fittest\" mentality, the theme is addressed very poignantly in this story. I was repulsed by Scarletts ruthlessness, yet I also admired her courage and strength. Rhett was heartbreaking as he seemed to be ravaged by his own anger. He was a man who was desperate for love as are we all. Rhett seems to symbolize our own hungry souls. He is strong in some ways yet startlingly weak in others. He reminded me a little of the character Heathcliff in Emily Bronte's \"Wuthering Heights\".My only complaint of the book is the treatment of black individuals. Many people have written on this subject, so I will not do so here. I did like Mammy's character even though she was stereotypical.Mitchell's characterization is superb. My favorite character is Melanie Wilkes. She is portrayed as a gentle yet strong woman. Melanie is courageous in her own way, and I loved her bravery in standing up against others who criticized those she loved. I also felt empathy as well as repugnance for both Scarlett and Rhett. All the characters are memorable, and Mitchell paints a vivid picture of struggle, disstruction, and triumph as the people within the story fight against the ravages of war.This book will stay with you long after you read it. Please give this wonderful story a chance. I'll definitely watch the movie again. I think I'll have a better appreciation for the film. God bless you all.",
            "I've been a fan of the story since I first saw Gone with the Wind when I was a little girl. I didn't even know it was based on a book until all the media attention that the sequel Scarlett got when I was in junior high. I immediately went to the library and checked out Gone with the Wind. Even though I loved the movie I loved the book so much more. There are so many details that have been left out. Since then I've read a lot of other historical fiction but this one is still my favorite. There's a good reason why this is such a popular classic novel.",
            "After seeing the movie many, many, MANY timea, I finally decided I MUST read this book. This is my selection for our book club. I could hardly put the book down. The movie was wonderful, but the book is FANTASTIC! Love it, love it, love it. We will be discussing this selection in our book club in early February and I know each of our members are thoroughly enjoying this read!",
            "This was my third time reading this book, each time in a different age period and each time with different experience and reflection on the story and characters of this wonderfully lavish and complex drama. yes I agree that the story is biased and somewhat racist. However, it reflects the attitudes of the general culture and way of life that existed back then in 1800s during and post Civil War. Put that aside (or rather become familiar with that specific culture), the story is heartbreaking, informative, and really addictive. I mean I would definitely recommend that before starting this book, clear your schedule for a week or two because once you start it is hard to put it down until you have reached the last page! You just get drawn into the this very well written story and you fall in love with all characters that are portraited with all of their complexities, strenghts, weaknesses, and yes lots and lots of mistakes and misunderstandings! So much that it breaks your heart over and over again and you can't help but to shake you head or even swear at them!",
            "Imagine that in a flurry, your old life disappears; what was once poverty and happiness has transformed into poverty and a new, bittersweet lifestyle. Welcome to Scarlett O'Hara's corrupted world, where what once seemed improper is now necessary to survive. I thought this book brilliantly combined romance, adventure, and non-fiction information based on the southern aspect of the Civil War.",
            "I READ THIS BOOK AT ABOUT THE AGE OF 14. IT WAS THE FIRST BOOK ,EVEN AT THE LENGTH IT IS, THAT I DIDN'T WANT TO END! I SO MUCH WANTED THE CHARACTERS TO CONTINUE! WHEN I FINALLY SAW THE MOVIE YEARS LATER-IT WAS MORE THAN I COULD HAVE ASKED FOR. IT WAS ABOUT THAT TIME THAT I FELL IN LOVE WITH CLARK GABLE! I FEEL THAT THIS BOOK WAS THE ORIGINAL HISTORICAL ROMANCE NOVEL, AND THAT EVERYTHING ELSE PALES IN COMPARISON!",
            "I must have read this book umpteen number of times and i find the characters of Scarlet and Rhett ever evolving .If u are a die hard romantic who believes in fighting for your dreams then this book is a must ...",
            "This book is quite fair, not exactly the best, but good enough. I thought it should be a very challenging book but I was disappointed...I read it last year (13 yr old) and was astonished on how easy the vocabulary is and how easy it is to read this book.As for the story...it's pretty good. I really like those historical novels, and the writing and descrbtion is wonderful... but some parts of the story is a drag.",
            "I love this book, I've read about 6 or 7 times at least. It's fun reading about someone more: clueless, and selfish than me.",
            "First of all: I adored the movie. I fell in love with Gable and with Leigh at the same time. Everyone could see that they were made for each other. I mainly expected a romantic love story when I started to read the novel. Yet it was nowhere to be found though a lot of reviewers seem to have seen what I obviously could not see.The first shock was that Scarlett is apparently only sixteen when she first meets Rhett, aged thirty-three, an already middle-aged, sophisticated man who chases after an incredibly shallow and vain teenager with much more gumption than wit. Scarlett is so emotionally immature and ignorant that it borders on blatant stupidity. I usually love it when the heroes indulge in verbal duels but those in this book I could not enjoy for Scarlett always looks foolish in them. To make it worse she is as cold as a fish, extremely childish and calculating. The authoress referred to her charm, intelligence and allure more than once but I couldn't see any of it except her beauty of course and that she was hard to get. She could be Becky Sharp's little sister but at least Thackeray's lady possessed intellect, a good judgment for people and a great sense of humor. To be fair I have to say that the heroine is resilient and smart when it comes to business. She also isn't afraid of hard work though exactly those only likeable traits make her suspicious to the good people of Atlanta. Yet Rhett was hardly a Harlequin hero either. Unlike his movie character he is bitingly sarcastic and acidly derisive instead of charming, amusing and witty. I found him considerably more sinister than Gable. He is violent, unreliable and really ruthless in a menacing way. With very good reason men usually don't like him. The way he is portrayed I couldn't like him either. I had no clue if Rhett loved Scarlett or not and if he did, why? Her reactions remained equally enigmatic in the novel. The book was surely a fascinating read for a lot of reasons but it made me unhappy in an unpleasant way. The characters often treat each other in such a hateful and cruel way that it was painful to watch. Whatever kind of love those two felt for each other, tenderness and true concern for the other seemed to have been no part in it. For fans of true romance I cannot recommend this book.",
            "Yes, it is a magnificent novel, an American classic. Filled with larger than life characters Gone with the Wind takes the reader to a chapter of American history not readily remembered (Southern Reconstruction) and to institutions we wish we could not remember (slavery, racism and the KKK).Lets talk about the novel. It is not a book for the faint of heart- my edition is over 700 pages. Yet, Margaret Mitchell has the gift to immerse you in a world that has long since passed. From the comfort of our armchairs it is difficult for us to imagine the sense of lostness the southern gentry must of felt during and after the war. They simply lost everything. Yet, there is something about the American character that does not want to give up, a stubbornness best personified by Scarlet O'Hara.I first read Gone with The Wind in the early 90's, it left an indelible imprint on my mind. About a year ago as I was persuing my library, it caught my eye again. I pull it for the self, sat down in my wing back chair and began reading eagerly anticipating being drawn into Mitchell's south once again. This time, however, I could not finish the book. A few hundred pages into it, I gently closed the cover and put it back into my library. What was it that caused me not complete this book? It was the blatant racism that seemed to permeate every other page.Yes, I realize that this book was written by a southerner reflecting a time and culture long since gone. Yes, racism is an appropriate subject to write about. Yes, one may write a novel that reflect the racism of the antebellum south- but this is one country preacher who will not read it again.",
            "Really, that's my only gripe. Too many pages and all that dialogue and long paragraphs with Mammy and Prissy and all the others talking so strangely. I blame it on Margaret Mitchell!But despite the length (1,037 pages) and overbearing dialogue, I found the book to be very enjoyable. It took me a whole year to read this damn thing, but at least I finally finished! And I am not going to read SCARLETT or THE WIND DONE GONE!Anyways, I loved the movie especially! Vivien Leigh is hot and gorgeous! Gable is Gable, classy and smug! I have the tape at home as part of my Best Picture collection. The movie is also long, at nearly 4 hours! But in the end, Mitchell did a good job. Alice Randall and Alexandra Ripley should be ashamed of themselves for thinking they could do better! HA!Pretty good reading, as long as nothing interferes with it. I found myself putting the damn thing away and leaving it for months on end. Thanks to my job with those bastards at the UF Foundation, I got a chance to get through it!I am the man!",
            "I've been thinking for a long time that I should read this book--and I'm probably not alone. It's not like I don't know the plot, but still, I've always imagined that it's a classic piece of American storytelling. Let's just say that the writing can be hackneyed, and at times cringe-worthy. But what will make this book last is Mitchell's ability to tell a story, to make people want to turn the page, and experience what happens next. This skill is often undervalued and overlooked, but makes her talent stand above the abilities of others who can write a better sentence. I would recommend this book, not as a timeless piece of literature, but of storytelling.",

            "Introduction: This classic novel is full of famous statements like `Tomorrow is an other day.' It is also made into a film, which had won 9 Oscar Academy Awards based on this story.Summary: This story is set in the American Civil War. Scarlet O'Hara is a pretty but proud young lady. She is living in the south of America. Gentlemen love her. But the prince in Scarlet heart is Ashley. Ashley is a bookworm. Although Scarlet loves him, he has chosen his cousin to be his wife. Scarlet is so angry and marry a man she doesn't love. But then the war breaks out. Scarlet's husband dies. The land south of America is losing from land north of America. She then finally finds her true love. Rhett Buttler, Scarlet's third husband has a wonderful time with her until Rhett finds a great secret about Scarlet...Opinion: I think that this story is absolutely wonderful. When you are reading the book, the character's personality will attract you. But I don't really like Scarlet. Although she is beautiful, she is vain and mean. It has a very good storyline. It makes you continue reading page after page. This book teaches us a lot of lessons. And it also tells us how bad, cruel war is. I think this is the greatest love story ever.Audience: This book is good for age 13 or above. It is good for everyone. But I'm afraid that the complicated story will confuse younger readers. J",
            "I read this when I was in 5th grade, and I fell in love with it! Scarlett is one of the most interesting, fun-to-read-about characters ever, and you're pretty much transported to the world of the antebellum American South.There's a reason this book has such enduring popularity!",
            "Gone With the Wind is an amazing book that leaves you a changed person.Treasure, treasure, treasure your first time read because the impact of this book is so deep you'll be left in a trance for days. Whilst reading this novel you will eat, sleep, breathe Gone With the Wind - so place any important activities on hold and don't read if there is any exams ahead!The first time you read it is a feeling that will be in your heart forever!!! A magical journey that grips your senses and rips at your heart, but devestatingly,can only be travelled once. But don't worry, although you can never really grasp those same feeling ever again, the book will still have you hooked everytime you read it. You will still hope and wish that Scarlett will find true happiness, even if such dreams are futile. I've read it on average once a year since that first awesome time and it neevr ceases to hook me in.The characters are all well-developed, particularly Scarlett (the main character). The reader is given a great insight and undestanding of Scarlett which is why she rightfully claims her spot in history. She is quite simply unforgettable. An amazing character who stands the test of time and, in my mind, has become a memory of a real person.Reader's should not look to this book for the rights and wrongs of slavery or deep insights of the civil war. This is a romance novel that Mitchell has intwined beautifully with minor war details and a subtle look into the pre-war South.There is a reason why this is one of the most well-known and purchased book of all time. Read it and you will find out. But be warned, the ending will break your heart and it will be as painful as any real-life romance. Hard to believe I know, but the characters so amazing that they stay with you 24 hours a day whislt reading and you feel their emotions like you are them. Margaret Mitchell was a very talented lady.",
            "The last book that I finished was Gone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell. It is set during the Civil War in the South, specifically in Atlanta. It is the story of Scarlett O'Hara and how her life changes during the Civil War and early Reconstruction. She is selfish and vain and will do about anything to rebuild her life after the North wins the war. She is left very poor and has to provide for the survivors of her family. She will do anything to make some money, even marry several times to people that she doesn't care for while the real \"love\" of her life is married to her sister-in-law. Scarlett just wants to have enough money to once again become the belle of the county.One character that she meets on this journey that I particularly enjoyed was Rhett Butler. Rhett is a charming, opinionated man with money that sees Scarlett how she really is and tells people the truth, however harsh that it is.I liked this book because it is about the Civil War, but through the eyes of a vain young woman whose life drastically changes. If you like historical fiction with a romantic twist, you will probably enjoy this classic tale of love between two interesting personalities.",
            "Hey, 'Reader from Santa Fe'. Yes there are passages which are cringeworthy. And do you know what? Thank God it's never been banned! For MM to have written it any other way would be a fib. No, I'm not talking about the glorification of slavery and their 'barracks.' I am with you and Toni Morrison 100% on the reality of this outrageous part of history. But for MM to have written it any other way would hardly ring true. Anyone who knows about her life knows that she was writing from the perspective that she did because that was her experience. She lived in a world of white supremacy and segregation, and do you know what? I read this and think thank goodness we don't now! Thak goodness I can have the friends that I want to and date the guys I want to, regardless of their background. GWTW is as much a historical document, albeit laced with southern pride, inasmuch as it shows what past attitudes were. I see GWTW as a great story nonetheless, with strong characters clashing with each other and riding roughshod over others in the name of self-survival. Not always attractive qualities, but qualities that have themselves survived. May I recommend The Wind Done Gone by Alice Randall? She writes that MM and GWTW inspired her to think. They inspired me too.",
            "After I read the Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood (by Rebecca Wells), I really wanted to read Gone with the Wind. In Sisterhood, Wells characters actually attend the premier of the movie. I have seen the movie, Gone with the Wind, several times, but, as usual, the book is much better. I really enjoyed the &quot;love story&quot; about Scarlett and Rhett. I wish Mitchell had written the sequel, which I have not read. She did an excellent job with the characters and I amnot sure if anyone could do it better. The story is true to life. Scarlett seemed to think the grass was greener on the otherside and that money/material things is the answer to everything. Not always true. Scarlett failed to see what she had in Rhett, until she lost him. Something to think about. I really hated to see this book end.",
            "The book &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; by Margaret Mitchell is my favorite book ever. Since I was only in sixth grade when I read it, even I found it a great book. Both the movie and the book have been American standards for literature. There are dozens of memorable characters, with plenty of juicy parts to hold it together. Even though it is 1,024 pages, it is very hard to put down. I read it over three months, about 20 pages a day, and I had to limit myself! This is surely the greatest book ever written. However, if you are the movie type, do not let me limit you. See the Academy Award winning move &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; with Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable give thier performance of thier career! Filled with lots of exciting characters, events, scenery, and detail; all of this is needed to create the best piece of American Literature, and &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; by Margaret Mitchell has it all.",
            "Ever since reading Gone with the wind in sixth grade, it has been my favorite book! It is fun and easy to read. Margret Michell knew how to perfectly balance a story with seriousness and pure comic relief. The story takes place during a rough time in the South, The American Civil War. Scarlet is devoted to the Cofederate cause, or at least at sometimes she seems to be. At other times she appears to be more devoted to herself. Rhett Butler, the other main character could care less about the outcome of the war, as long as he is benefiting from the finanical booms it results in. Both the characters are so equally stubborn making them perfect for eachother, but neither of them can see this until it may be too late.",
            "Gone with the Wind is by far one of the best written books of our century. It takes us back through time, to a civilazation long since forgotten. To a time when all was well in the Old South, where beauty ran wild amidst the red clay of Georgia. From the outbreak of the Civil War in the view point of Georgian belle Scarlett O'Hara, to the end and beyond we become engrossed to the point where it is impossible to put the book down. The story follows the life of Scarlett O'Hara daughter of a wild Irishman and an aristocratic but kind French lady. We follow Scarlett through her weddings and her childbirths, through her long trip home to her beloved Tara. We experiance her rejection and her revilation that the land is the only thing that really lasts and the only thing worth fighting for. Through her pain and her misery, through her laughter, and her tears we laugh with her and cry with her. We feel the hardships of war and the fury of the aftermath, and we watch, as does Scarlett and the rest of the all star cast, the destruction of a civilazation that is truly Gone with the Wind. For everyone who loves the Old South, for anyone who loves a good book. Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind truly touches her readers, and makes one unforgettable novel.",
            "I finally read this book years after seeing the motion picture. I fell in love with the characters and found my sympathies and compassion straining towards those I hadn't imagined I could feel anything for... Rhett knew what he was getting into, yet he loved Scarlet despite all her fall-backs and the knowledge he'd always be in another man's shadow. Rhett and Melanie were my favourite characters because they were both strong people who had the courage to love. I agree this book could be seen as racist, yet I also believe it is a historical novel in some parts which does justice to the Southerners side of the story. Yes, none of us agree with slavery. However, those were the times and that's how life was. Margaret Mitchell is being true. She displays the sympathies of the time her book is set. Judging it by modern standards of racism is the same as judging Shakespeare by modern political correctness. You can't. I belive this is a beautiful book and a beautiful love story. I encourage anyone with an open mind and a compassionate heart to read it.",

All young adults studying the South and the Civil War period should be required to read Gone With the Wind and to see the movie as well. An enduring classic for all time, Gone With the Wind has been read three times by my young adult granddaughter, and I also have given it several readings! Great character development, setting, and realistic experiences that seal the characters and the time period forever in one's mind. And don't miss Scarlett, a follow-up by another author.

            "When I read this book I could not for my life keep myself away from it. I was changed, I was inspired, and I was genuinely mpressed and surprised. I was flabberghasted that a woman in that era would have that attitude and daring,(I say this on the part of the author, as well as the protagonist). Read this book, and have more insight! Loved it.",
            "As others have said in their reviews, GWTW is a great book. To repeat all the reasons why would be quite redundant of me. Simply, I recommend GWTW if one wants to discover the white southern female point of view concerning the Civil War era American south. I also recommend Harriet Jacobs' &quot;Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl&quot; to anyone BRAVE enough to discover the black southern female slave point of view concerning the Civil War era American south. Seeing as GWTW is very long, and Ms. Jacobs' work is around 200 pages, I'd read &quot;Incidents&quot; first. It's another truly amazing literary work...an account of southern slavery from the pen of a former slave herself! There is much much interesting information concerning the relationship between mistress and female slave/house attendant that will provoke thought as one reads GWTW afterwards.",
            "I started out reading Gone with the Wind last year, and I thought it was the most awful chore of a read ever. However, as soon as I hit page 400, it got really interesting. And when I was done, I had to admit that I loved it. It was the first (and only book besides Scarlett and The Exorcist) that made me cry. All I have to say is that, anyone who hates this book must either be dead or just moronic.",
            "This book was so good my friends are all reading it! I told every one of my friends about it, that's how good it was! It took me 4 days to read it, because i stayed up all night long just to finish it. The passion in this book made my spine tingle, and my heart beat faster than it has in a while! Anyone who reads it will find it one of the best books you'll ever find.",
            "... Millions of people not only remember Gone with the Wind, but re-read it faithfully. Literary critics and scholars don't like this book and wish it would go away. The reason? They can't quite account for its enduring popularity. It's sentimental. It doesn't break new literary ground. It's racist. Blah, blah, blah. And yet. How many other works of so-called \"popular fiction\" from the '30s and '40s are remembered, let alone read, today? None. How many are even in print? None. The hub-bub surrounding Alice Randall's satirical follow-up last year had less to do with that novel's merits than the near mythical status Gone with the Wind has achieved in American culture. Why? Because Mitchell tells a helluva story. Unforgettable and complex characters, an involving plot and a timeless theme: survival. The pacing, structure and language run circles around most books published today, yes, even those with literary aspirations. All this and heroine who dares not to be liked. Come to think of it, maybe Mitchell did break new ground. Pick it up. You won't be able to put it down.",
            "I expected this book to be just a dramatic love story but it is so much more than that.I fell in love with Rhett, expierianced all the pain scarlett went through,cried when Melly died and laughed over and over again at Rhett and scarlett's witty repartee.To me this means this is a great book and to anybody that will listen I would tell you that, to not read it would mean that you are really missing out on a wonderful expierience.",
            "This is a great book, I borrowed it from the library twice and then decided to just go ahead and buy it. I bought the paperback version, which is great to read, but my only problem was it falls apart. After reading through about 2 chapters, and only one week of owning the book, the paper had separated from the back. I definitely would recommend the book, only get the hardback one.",
            "It isn't all about the romance. Let me just blurt this out: Rhett is the HOTTEST MAN and after reading this you will be disappointed in every man you meet! He makes my blood boil like mad! He drives me mad! God, he's so damn sexy. He truly knows a woman and what she wants, and definitely what I want. I suggest that every man read in detail of Rhett's kissing technique because we need more men with skills like those. But enough of my gushing. Gosh, I wish I could have met this gifted writer who has combined multiple themes, tones, characters, and ideas and weaved it into this novel. I am not kidding nor exaggerating when I say this is the best novel, was always the best novel, and will always be the best novel. I've never laughed so hard or sobbed so much for a book. Everything fits right into place. THis is a perfect symphony on which the description of setting flow so well into the characters. I love the clever remarks of Rhett. Yes, he's VERY clever, as well as sexy. However, this is NOT a trashy romance novel. Margaret Mitchell does not give the usual and cliched damsel in distress heroine. Many intelligent and not-so-intelligent people have complained that of supposed rape, the inaccuracy of slaves were actually treated by their owners, and other indecencies. The one about rape is a flimsy complaint that can be easily refuted because it wasn't and the description of the scene fully suggests otherwise. However, the latter complaint has more value. However, if you really want to see the truth of the treatment of black slaves, just pick up Howard Zinn's A People's History of the United States for such purposes. I am glad that the heroine was an imperfect hero. She was as real as any human. Scarlett is the person name for her because it certainly reflects her red-hot devotion to her beloved home Tara and her parents. Other characters such as Melanie and Ashley were so excellently developed. The characters can't get any closer to reality. However, I have lost many nights of sleep for reading this. This is so addictive that I could give up sleep for days in a row.",
            "As the title of the movie portrays it, &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; is the disappearance of a whole civilization after the Civil War, or a civilization gone with the wind. The movie is about the different stages at which the South was before, through, and finally during Reconstruction. At first, we observe how the Southern aristocracy lived during their peak years when the price of cotton was up in the skies. At the barbecue at Twelve Oaks, the Wilk's plantation, the movie depicts the arrogance of the southern gentlemen, since most of them wanted to go to war and blabbered expressions like, &quot;...a southern gentlemen is worth any ten yankees...&quot; They are all absolutely sure that they will win the war in a matter of months, but as it turned out they were absolutely incorrect. During this part of the movie, the views of the South that we observe are pretty biased, because slaves were treated as part of the family and with a lot of respect. In some plantations like the O'Hara's it could've happened, but it was very rare. Suddenly, when war is declared all of the southern beaux go to enlist into the army feverishly. The only one with a realistic view is Rhett Buttler, since he tells the men that before they start talking about victory they should be concerned in building more factories to supply their troops with such things as weapons and clothing. At this time, Rhett is looked at with scorn. But afterwards, he becomes a hero because he is the one who breaks the Union blockade and smuggles supplies into Charleston. When the war drags on, the south is just lingering its defeat. The movie also depicts the southern courage during the war, but with just courage and persistent one can't with the war. The movie is actually very realistic when it shows the wounded and the lack of supplies the southern hospitals had to help them. Finally when the war is about to end, we see General Sherman's troops marching into Atlanta and the evacuation of the city. In this scene, the movie also portrays Scarlett's courage by managing to take Melanie and the baby to Tara. When they finally arrive to Tara, we really see the devastation that took place at the South by the Union troops. At this moment, Scarlett vowed that no matter what she had to do, she would never suffer from hunger again in her life. Later, the carpetbaggers, or the blacks that come from the north, and the scalawags, southern people that supported reconstruction, make life very harsh for the southern people. They raise the taxes to the skies knowing that there is no way for them to be paid, but Scarlett with her strength and wit manages to pay them. Finally when she is established and married to Mr. Douglas, she starts a lumber business with Ashley Wilks. All her old friends criticize Scarlett, since she has become a scalawag herself and is dealing with the northern merchants. This part of the movie is very ironic because Ashley refuses to gain profit from forced labor, in this case prisoners that are brought to the mill by an overseer. Scarlett replies that he used to own slaves, but he tells her that even if the war didn't occur, they were going to be free when his father died. Again we observe the nostalgic and sympathetic view towards the South in the story line. Finally, the movie also presents the reactions that the Southerners had against the colored people. When Scarlett is attacked in the dark side of town, her husband and the other men pretend to be in a 'political meeting' while they are raiding into the blacks area burning their houses and killing some men. They wanted to 'clean' this area so it was safe for Scarlet to travel to the mill. Similar events did take place after the war. In fact, some of them took place in a larger scale and included lynchings and other violent acts. This anti-black feeling lead to the sprouting of groups like the Ku Klux Klan and the violence among both groups continued for a long time. Overall, &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; is a great movie that gives us a feeling of what it was like to live during the Civil War. Although it gets carried away sometimes by being slightly biased, the movie is a very good representation of the events that took place during this period. Besides from providing some historical evidence, it presents the different feelings and responses that the people had towards the confli",

            "\"Gone With the Wind\", taken as pure fiction, stands as an interesting and well-written tale of life in the Old South. Characters are well developed and constant in their portrayal of the complexities of love and life under the strain of a collapsing civilization. Survival amidst tremendous hardships and the source of strength in the human soul are topics that the novel/movie address nicely. However, taken in a context of reality, \"Gone With the Wind\" is insulting to the reader's/viewer's intelligence and to the ancestors of Southerners, both black and white, free and slave, through its completely one-sided depiction of life in the plantation south. Many other reviewers on this site have commented that \"Gone With the Wind\" is a nice change from other books and movies in that it portrays the master/slave relationship as being affable. The truth, however, is not so pleasant. It is evident from the reading of historical documents that even the kindest of slaveholders did not keep their slaves as well-clothed, well-fed, and lightly worked as the O'Haras kept theirs. Only once did the movie portray slaves doing field labor. It never showed the slaves' living quarters, which were often less than comfortable. The only brutality and punishment it showed was when Scarlet hit Prissy for not moving fast enough when Melanie was giving birth. The representation of Mammy is partly accurate in that she was a jack-of-all-trades woman who cared especially for the master's children. The other side of the \"Mammy\" role however, was that on most plantations, the mammy was overworked, on-call 24 hours a day, and abused sexually and physically by the master. Also, a mammy would have never had the authority to boss around a master's daughter like Mammy bossed around Scarlet. For those who desire a well-written piece of fiction that takes place in a beautiful and gentile fantasy world called the Old South, I would surely recommend \"Gone With the Wind\". For those who know better than to believe in illusions of peace and warmth in the plantation south and who enjoy books that have at least one foot in the doorway of reality, \"Gone With the Wind\" will not be on your list of favorites.",
            "Nice story, feels a little like a soap opera at times, but the civil war part of the story is excellent. Could have and should have been shorter...lots of filler.Overall it is pretty good read.",
            "It never got boring. Every page was exciting. The character of Scarlet O'Hara is one that will be your favorite forever. All of her imperfections just make you love her more. It was one of those books that you wish wouldn't have ended, even though it is well over one thousand pages long. It is almost sad to think that no other book, in my mind, will ever live up to Gone With the Wind.",
            "No words can express the feelings this novel has evoked in millions of readers across the globe, and in myself, as well. It sings a song of such captivating music that it tears itself into the very epitome of one's soul; Gone with the Wind has moved me, touched me, held me. It sheds light on lessons more precious than gold or silver, more valuable than platinum. I could go on and on...but I'm sure you get my drift. Cry, weep, laugh, smile...whatever you do, don't be a fool...don't miss out on this one.",
            "I loved the book and I am currently reading 'Scarlett' to see if Scarlett does indeed get her man... I enjoyed reading all about the Civil War and the terrible effects it had on the Southern people. I thought Scarlett, Rhett and Mammy were fantastic characters - although I must admit I did, occassionally, feel like banging Scarlett and Rhett's heads together!! I couldn't stand Ashley - what a wuss!! I particularly liked Melanie, she seems like such a weak little goodie good two shoes but, in fact, she is actually a very strong, courageous woman and the truest friend you could ever have. A wonderful novel - I can see why it is a classic!!",
            "I first saw the movie, and I loved it, so I decided to read the book. I found that the book had so much more depth than the movie which I had already thought breath-taking. Scarlett is someone we can all relate to, yet hopefully not too closely. It is always difficult to stick with a book that is sooo long, but Gone with the Wind was one that wasn't a problem. I loved how Scarlett realized that she loved Rhett because I think that many people overlook their true loves for a lust object that would never make them happy. The book was amazing because it was so beautifully polished and taught many valuable life lessons. I would recommend it to anyone!",
            "Gone With the Wind is one of the best books ever written! It teaches a wonderful lesson. No matter what happens, there is going to be a tomarrow, and you shouldn't give up hope! Scarlett lost everything, but she was still strong and she still had hope. Margaret Mitchell is a wonderful writer. Scarlett and Rhett and her other timeless charactors are so real to me and to millions of people. Only a great book could have such an impact on America and the world that GWTW has!",
            "This is one of the best books I have ever read. If you don't enjoy it, there is something mentally wrong with you! (Just kidding-sort of) I can understand how it could be a challenging book, it IS over 1,000 pages long, however it's worth it. I knew a girl with a learning disability that caused her to read at a very slow rate, therefore giving her a genuine hatred of books. Someone gave her a copy of Gone with the Wind, and though she started it grudgingly, she couldn't put it down, and believe me, she read through that book faster then..well, (stick analogy here) it's a wonderful book! It gives you a true understanding of the south. That's the way it really was. Tara forever.",
            "This probabaly has to be the best book ever written. Mitchell did a great job on the plot, characters, everything! What she did the best on was the characters. Those were definetly three dimentional characters. When you are done you think that there is no way that this is fiction because Scarlett, Rhett, and everybody seem so real. You also come to like Scarlett because with all her faults, she is still a brave and strong character. Trust me, don't be intimadated by its size. It will probably be the best book you ever read.",
            "I love the movie Gone With the Wind, so I decided to read the book. I read the whole, 1,000-plus page book in a week! It's every bit as good, if not better. It is much better at explaining history and certain situatuions than the movie. (If you didn't understand the buisiness about the attack at Shantytown in the movei, read the book for a better understanding.) Margaret Mitchell also gives vivid, loving descriptions of the Old South, though I had to skim most of them so they wouldn't slow me down! She also gives vivid characterizations of all the main characters and quite a few more who weren't in the movie. The story is very enthralling and never boring. I definitly recommend it.",
            "Its an unforgettable experience. When i read this book, i was not aware of any hype about this book. I just remeber the day i read this book in the library, back in India. Its a sunny morning. I just picked this book from the reference section, as i was waiting for some card or something, and started reading it. It was 7 in the morning, Few minutes would have gone,i think becuse, i have shifted myself a little. Suddenly somebody tapped me on the shoulder. Its the librarian. She said its 10 at night ans she is closing the library. She allowed me to take the book with me and I read it on and on until 8 in the morning, which was when i finished it. For 24 hours without food and sleep, without even a silghtest glance away from the book.Wahw Its truely an incredible experience.For one whole day i was beside the Scarlett, mind and soul.It is at that moment, i decided if Americans are down to earth as those characters, then it should not be very bad place and i came to America. After i came here and what i found, Its totally different story!!!",
            "I read this amazing novel approximately two years ago, since then I have read it several more times. It only took me about one week to read, I was so wrapped up in it that I put off homework to read it, I simply couldn't put it down. Believe me I don't read anything that fervently, other than Gone With the Wind. It is so descriptive, it wraps you up in this amazing story of love lost and lives, wasted on petty things. I personaly felt for the characters, being a hellraiser myself, I truely felt for Scarlett's plight and pain. I think that if you are a person who can be unaffected by all the media hype put into things, and just read this book you will be swept away by it's dazzling imagry and depiction of life and love and loss.",
            "This book is absolutely fantastic. I am 14 years old and believe me at the beginnning I absolutely loathed my best friend when she tried to convince me to read this book. She was so persuasive that I finally relented.....and I dont regret it one bit. THis book was so captivating that I found it so hard to put it down. Margaret Mitchell has indeed done a fantastic job. Her descriptions are excellent and the conversations are well written indeed. This book is definitely a must read for all those who love Classical novels for it is unique and quite unbeatable.",
            "Gone With the Wind is a great book about a young woman named Scarlett O'Hara who is selfish and cares only about herself as she struggles to keep herself alive during the Civil War. If you enjoy reading stories during the Civil War, this is the book for you.",
            "Gone with the wind is definately my favorite book of all time. Margaret Mitchell portrays Scarlett and Rhett and everyone else with such detail that i felt i was watching it all happen. Every joy, every sorrow.... It is absolutely impossible to put down!!! My suggestion: read it on a weekend with nothing planned, and keep a box of tissues nearby. (can't wait to read the sequel, Scarlett)",
            "I've loved GWTW since I first saw it at the age of 12, but it wasn't until I was almost 30 before I read the book and boy was I surprised! Scarlett had more than one child! Margaret Mitchell wrote about characters other than those in the movie and once you read the novel, you'll wonder how Selznick was ever able to get the movie made. What a story. What an author. Read it and finally understand.",
            "This is the world's best book EVER! I have read hundreds of books, and not one rivaled this one! If you never read another book in your whole life, read this one. It is so amazing. You can't put it down. MM spins a web around you and you are trapped until the book is through. For two days after I read the book, I talked of nothing but the book (I am dead serious-ask my mom) Scarlett changed my life, she inspired me, she taught what to do- and what NOT to do. This book is the greatest.",
            "This book is the best book I have read in a long time.Although I first saw the movie, I was enchated with the book.Gone with the wind takes place around 1862, when the civil war strikes in The United States and tells the story and problems that Scarlett O'hara had to face.She is a spoiled and stubborn woman and that's why she never realizes the love she feels for Rhett Butler.Both of the main characters are stubborn persons,they love each other but in the same time they distrust their feelings.Rhett believed that Scarlett was in love with Ashley Wilkes and she believe he spent his time with another woman.Their distrust makes tem try to hurt each other in every way and they never get time to tell their feelings. The story is sad,romantic,historical and wonderfully written and the end surprises every one who read it.I completely loved this story and I recommended it to everyone who wants to read a true book.This classical novel will bring you to a world where you never imagined you could be when you read a book.There will never be a book such as.... GONE WITH THE WIND.",
            "Your initial reaction after seeing the movie is, &quot;How could this be any better than the movie?&quot;. But when you start in on the 1,000+ page epic. Your questions are answered in a few short paragraphs. Mitchell did her research and managed to produce on of the finest authoring efforts the history of American literature has ever seen. She managed to intertwine bits of her own life into the novel and provided her readers with a brilliant pallet of realistic characters. If there is any book that could make a reader weep, this is it. However, you have to keep warm while reading this to keep the goosebumps down.",
            "This is an amazing book. Suspensfull, and romantic, i was hooked by the first chapter. This classic story is the romantic tale of Scarlett O'Hara Hamilton Kennedy Butler, the strong, smart women of the civil war. The book tells the story of her growth as a person, her strength, her willfullness, and is an ongoing source of delight, tears, and endless romance. I recommened it to everyone and anyone. It is my very favorite book. Margaret Mitchell weaves a colorful and expressive masterpiece, and i am all praise! Read this book!",
            "a book about romance usually bores me. It's no more than datings and marriages and divorces and remarries and who loves who. But definitely not this one. Mitchell has set an example on how to write a great romantic novel. And it's not merely a romance, it's a historical romance. And Mitchell was not merely an author, either, she was a historian. I see this book from three perspective; as a reader, a woman, and a college student majoring in International Relations. As a reader, I surely recommend this book to anyone, especially those interested in Civil War, American History and last but not least, romance. But one small tip, you might consider reading this book during your long break, since it's hard to put it down. As a woman, I view Scarlett O'Hara is a pure material girl, until life gives her valuable lessons about losing all the people she actually loves all her life that she did not realize before. But Mitchell created a good balance by adding a lot of good personality traits; hard working, courageous and brave. I admire especially her fast maturity she got after the O'Haras lost their once prosperous plantation and her high ambition to bring it back to a great plantation after Civil War did a damage to it. Also, Scarlett values richness not just for the money and pleasure it brings, although she did say several times that money is the most valuable thing in life. She also values richness to satisfy her dreams to see the world. As a Southern woman ( well-bred too ) on her time, Scarlett surely was one of the few who values brain beside beauty , which she shows by running her second husband's store and lumber yard and not a bit pay any attentions to other Atlanta ladies who despise her. Scarlett might be full of airs and graces, but she keeps it in the right place and the right time. Thirdly, as an international relations student, this book is qualified as a history book on the Civil War. Mitchell added a great deal of details not only about Civil War but also about slavery, which brought me to give more credits to her. A lot of book about slavery in the South view black slaves only as those who were looked down by their white masters. But not in Gone With The Wind.Mitchell viewed them as part of the family who had their white masters' full trust, like Pork, Mammy and Uncle Peter. It is the first time I found out that they also had something as social status in those days by being owned by different kind of white masters.",
            "This novel is a great piece of historical fiction, and it's not just for women, either. Set in the American Civil War, the story is about the life of a Georgian Southern Belle who is abruptly thrust from her pampered plantation life into the harsh realities of a very brutal war. Only her courage, strength, and resourcefulness get her through the wartime travails. That, however, is only the beginning of her struggles. After the war Scarlett faces the challenges of poverty, loneliness and death. She ends up being married three times (and burying two of her husbands), owning her own businesses, killing a soldier (and stealing the money and goods in his pockets), and generally doing everything considered unladylike at the time. Fictional characters set in an historic time, this book is a classic in every sense of the word. I've read it countless times (I still get something new out of it each time) and it should be in every well-read persons library. The movie of the same name follows the story closely (although some things had to be left out in the interest of time), stars Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable, and is widely regarded as one of the best films ever made.",
            "If you read GWTW strictly as a love story,you're missing part of the picture,and I'm saying this as someone who DID read it as a love story many years ago at the age of twelve. And I don't mean just the surface historical picture either.It goes so much deeper.Scarlett is of course the central character,and to me,a metaphor for the \"New South\",in that she compromises with the new circumstances in order to survive.Melanie appeared to me as a symbol of the \"Old South\"-but the part of it that had integrity and strength.They needed each other in order to survive,and it took Scarlett until the end of the book to realise this.Ashley is the part of the Old South that couldn't adjust.Rhett is the person who though he despised the old ways and all they stood for until age and time made him begin to realise what he had thrown away.He still had a cynicism about it,but he also had an appreciation for the charm of a time that would never be again.As with many others,Scarlett was my favorite character in my first few readings,but I came to a new appreciation of Melanie over time. I began to see that she had a true quiet strength that Scarlett could never approach,one that didn't require her to compromise her principles and her loyalty,as Scarlett had to,in order to survive. The character of Ashley,on many further readings,doesn't appear quite as pathetic as before(though I never found him THAT pathetic in the first place).He was simply,as he tragically recognised,an anachronism in his time,a beautiful dream which evaporated under the harsh glare of a new reality.He was the part of the dream that Scarlett clung to,even as she clung to the ideal of her mother Ellen,never seeing the truth of these ideals-the honor,strength,and integrity of the dream,rather than the outward forms.This was HER tragedy-even though she was a survivor of a kind,she had to destroy all that was good in order to do so.Melanie had the true moral courage that allowed her to survive without destroying the good-to me,a much more difficult kind of survival.I'll need to read this book so many more times before I'll feel finally understand it all,if I ever will.I understand the old story,being born and raised in the South,of the struggle to hold on to your identity and still be a part of the world around you.I understand why The War can feel like yesterday-after all, most of it was fought on the soil here,and the losers always remember longer.I think the background of Scarlett's father,Gerald O'Hara from Ireland,neatly ties into this.Read and re-read this book,because everytime you do you'll find depths you didn't plumb before.There is so much symbolism to be explored,each reading will provoke new thoughts.",
            "Perhaps because it was made into a hit movie, this book is sometimes considered a &quot;romance novel&quot; instead of great literature. It is, in fact, one of the great American novels. Mitchell does not portray the antebellum South as an ideal but rather a doomed society, like the &quot;Tara&quot; of Irish myth. The characters are thoroughly developed and complex. A must read for anyone interested in the Civil War, women in fiction, and American literature.",
            "I absolutely loved Gone With the Wind. I read over the summer because it was one of the choices on my school reading list and my mother and sister had read it and loved it. I didnt expect to like it all that much, but I was hooked after the first ten pages. It has become my favorite book. I couldn't stop thinking about it when I finished. I have reread it at least three times, and I am still left with the same feeling I had the first time. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. I would give it ten stars if I could.",
            "I am sure that there are thousands who share the same feeling - there cudn't have been a more realistic &amp; close to heart character portayal than that done by Mitchell. One has to read the book to understand how it can affect a person. I am sure no female ever gets over Rhett Butler (not even when her hair has turned gray - example my English literature teacher at school) and no man can resist Scarlett's charms (they are in the same boat as that of other fictitious characters in this epic).A must read.",
            "&iexcl;Gone with the Wind&iexcl; is my all-time favorite novel. I&iexcl;m so obsessed with the book that I think about it every day, in spite that I&iexcl;ve read it for like a hundred times. I cannot tell why I cannot get enough of the book. I&iexcl;ve been trying to tell myself that it&iexcl;s just a book of 1000 pages, telling the story of a belle&iexcl;s maturity and struggles for living, yet I just can&iexcl;t cut off my bond with it.Due to the colorful plot and intriguing dialogues, my opinion about it changes with time. As I first read it during junior high, I viewed it as a moving love story. Oddly, there was a time that I really hated the novel because it inevitably posed discrimination on African Americans. Nevertheless, my love for it was resurrected on my way of learning to grow up, for I highly respect the female main character, Scarlett O&iexcl;hara&iexcl;s courage and passion for living. Above all, I can always get something from reading the book.With its vivid description, I can picture a broad land, a luxurious house, people&iexcl;s looks in my mind. Though the novel is already pretty lengthy, still some parts were unsaid, leaving to readers&iexcl; imagination. I guess that&iexcl;s one of the reasons that make the book so catchy and unforgettable. With its classic movie version, it&iexcl;s amazing that my thoughts about it remain unaffected.The book is generally true to its historic background, and since the author depicts female mind profoundly, I can easily comprehend the idea she tried to convey or the metaphors. When Scarlett is happy or heart-broken, it seems like I&iexcl;m just there on the scene, feeling the trouble or pleasure she is confronted with. And it&iexcl;s one of the few books that make women respectable and independent, causing me to identify with it even more.I won&iexcl;t deny the fact that I&iexcl;m an incurable fan of the novel. It enriches my life and somehow glorifies my imagination. I will follow the strong determination the book suggests: &iexcl;Never ever give up!&iexcl;",
            "Gone with the Wind is a wonderful book. I just finished reading it a few days ago and I was blown away.I loved and hated Scarlett .Even though the ending is heartwrenching, Scarlett took Rhett for granted and she'll get him back somehow, she always gets what wants. Up until I read this book I never realized how rough it was for the south during and after the Civil War.This is a must read, if the book doesn't interest you now, try it again later, that's what I did.!",
            "I cannot describe how great this book was. It was the best book I ever read and I know I will read it more than once. Gone with the Wind had such a charm to it that is bound to sweep you off your feet. If want a book that gets you hooked in the first line of &quot;Scarlett O'Hara was not beautiful, but men seldon realized it when caught by her charms, as the Tarleton twins were&quot; to the last lines of this heart-wrenching book, then this book is a sure way to be enveloped. It tells of the southern life during the Civil War. Even if you aren't interested in history, like I am not, you can still be sure you will love it. I recommend this book to anyone who has patience and who loves Love-stories.",
            "Gone with the wind was the best book I have ever read. It is utterly captivating. Scarlett, the main character in the book, is someone that everyone should strive to be unlike, but secretly, throughout the whole book, you are rooting for her. Even at the stupidest things, you cry when Scarlett feels distraught. It will come deep into your soul and play with you emotions until all you can do is focus all your energy into reading this book. From the beginning to the end, you won't be able to put it down. It is a great (and sometimes quite graphic) display of what the civil war does to people and their beings. You will not regret reading this book, in any way shape or form. It is the most tantalizing book you will ever read. It is a great love story of desperate unrequited love and of hidden emotions that never show themselves until; it is unfortunately, too late. Everyone should have the experience of reading a book that is so magical that you really will never forget the way you felt through each amazing chapter. It is a must read for people over the age of ten. It will make you blood curdle and go cold at almost the same instant. Don't pass up the opportunity to read this book about the infamous love triangle of Scarlett O'Hara, Rhett Buttler, and Ashley Wilks. Never again will you find a book so worthwhile.",
            "Are you looking for a book that will be refused to put down? Then you may have just hit the ultimate jackpot;Gone with the Wind is a flurry of different themes that come together in one book,each of which beckon the reader to follow word after word to the last period.From romance to adventure, this book brilliantly entwines descriptions that come alive and stir emotions from deep in your heart.The author,Margaret Mitchell, carefully picks out her characters to make a rather interesting and unique combination that make this novel come to life.Join Scarlett O'Hara,the once pampered belle of the County,as she fights to regain her old life's treasures after the destructive effects the Civil War.Some will be frustrated,others,left melancholy,but the outcome of this beloved story is guaranteed to be breathtaking,one way or another.",
            "There will never be another book to match the greatness of \"GONE WITH THE WIND\". No matter how many times I read it and re-read it I have always falling prey to it's spell of great reading. I don't care for other people who have a fanatical hatred for this book. It seems sad that these people who call this great classic racist are also the same people saying that the South deserved what it got and the southern people too got what they desereved. How can they even suggest such a thing? The killing of civilians, the pillaging, the murder of whole families and black ex-slaves, the stealing of homes, the burning of whole towns, civil liberties taking away when the south and it's people were doing their best to start again and be part of the Union again after the war, martial law being the order of the day for over five years, the robbing of state government money, over taxation again for the South and it's people after the war and after taxes being one of primary reasons for the the war, the murder of many more man and their families for being defiant against a Government that lied to them again, and all is being condoned by people who live now in the present who say the Southern people deserved what they got for having slaves and daring to follow what the Consitution allowed? the right of session. Do these people not know the law? history and American governmentworkins?, and the right of session being an American and constitutional right?. How sad. Gone With The Wind is a book. A great book. The story of Scarlett O'Hara and her fight to never be hungry again, her fight to never let the Yankees beat her, and her fight to keep Tara her land from the Yankees. Scarett is a role model for anyone who will do anything to survive when the time comes to keep from being poor. Whether she is spoiled, caculating, and shrewed or just plain mean she gets what she wants, just like I think she would have gotten Rhett back sooner or later. Or Rhett would have come back. He loved her too much and waited to long for her to just give her up easily. Remember how he waited till the burning of Atlanta to enlist in the Cause to save the Condfederacy, of course he would have returned back to her in the end. And for all the people who think slavery was the only issue pertaining to the civil war. Read your history. Not public school history or present history. Read real history before 1970. You'll get the history you were robbed from. Remember slavery was legal so that made it okay in the eyes of the law before the Civil War. It was legal. It didn't make it right. Abraham Lincoln too said he wasn't sending troops South to end slavery, he was sending troops to end the Antebellum South.",
            "Gone with the Wind, by Margaret Mitchell, is a stunning book which is sure to hold readers enthralled. Embark on an exciting journey, following the flirtatious Scarlett O'Hara, dashing blockade runner Rhett Butler, sweetness personified Melanie Hamilton, and the wistful Ashley Wilkes. Scarlett has always been a petulant, coquettish, southern belle. But too soon, the Civil War strikes, and Scarlett's perfect world shatters around her. Her beloved Ashley is married to Melly, a girl Scarlett feels is the perfect example of boredom. During the tragic, bloody years of the Civil War, the sardonic Rhett Butler enters Scarlett's life. This stunning book is not only a historical melodrama, but also a book that reflects the human heart and shows how Scarlett can change from a selfish person to a strong woman.",
            "This book is another world that I lose myself in while reading it. I get so involved with the story and plot that when Scarlett is dismal, I am dismal. When Scarlett is defiant, I am defiant. This book never fails to move me. While some people see it as a racist pledge to the Confederacy, I see it as the key to how the South felt about the war, about the Reconstruction, about life...",
            "Read this book. And then read the sequel by Alexandra Ripley. Gone with the Wind is THE BEST! Beautiful, witty, definitly involved. What I love about these two books is that I became the character. I had read about her so much that I knew her inside and out, and I like books that do that for me. Margaret Mitchell is truly amazing and Alexandra Ripley did an outstanding recreating Scarletts life.",
            "I first read this book at the age of ten and have re-read it at least 15 times over the last decade. With each reading, I admire Mitchell's characters more and more. Mitchell's pen has an unerring eye for the telling detail. Aside from Rhett and Scarlett's stormy love, I think one of the most complex and fascinating relationships in the book is that of Scarlett and Melanie. Although Scarlett thinks she hates Melanie, she really depends on her as a substitute mother, and whether she realizes it or not, her actions towards Melanie are truly generous and good. Melanie, for her part, seems to worship Scarlett almost to the point of idolatry, and from the Twelve Oaks Barbecue scene until her death at the end of the book, never ceases protecting Scarlett from her detractors - just like Ellen O'Hara. Melanie is the only person who can ease Scarlett's anxiety about her fog nightmares other than Rhett. One of the most tragic things about the story is that when Scarlett fina! lly realizes just how much she loves and needs Melanie and Rhett, they are both lost to her on the same day. I've always wished that Mitchell had written a second volume (the Ripley book is wretched!), although I myself don't really see how Scarlett could get Rhett back, and there are no other people in her life who could take Melanie's place. Mitchell's story is both inspirational - Scarlett offers many lessons on how to cope with adversity, sorrow, and loss - and a magnificent exploration of the complexities of the human heart and mind. Each time I read this book I almost forget where I am and what else I should be doing. Margaret Mitchell was a great storyteller. I wish this book was longer.",
            "This is an incredible book! I found it extremely hard to put down. Margaret Mitchell guids you through all of the human emothions with this one. I is a griping novel about this civil war and it truely shows you what a horrible thing war is. Although I have not had that much time to read many books I can easily say that this book is the best I have ever read. I would esily give it 6 stars!",
            "When I picked up this book, I expected a long romance novel about a woman and her lover. What I read kept me up until 3 a.m. trying to finish it in one sitting. I would reccommend it to anyone. The one star I removed was due to the fact that it sometimes became confusing, with all of the marriages and deaths. I loved it. I severely do NOT reccommend to ANYONE the sequel, Scarlett.",
            "This book, Gone With the Wind, was so beautifully written that it seemed like the characters came off the page. Scarlett was not just someone from a book, but actually someone who lived.The book was the tale of Scarlett O'Hara from when she was 16 till she was 28. At the beginning of the book, Scarlett, daughter of a wealthy plantation owner, is in love with Ashley Wilkes. But Ashley is to marry his timid cousin Melanie Hamilton. Scarlett is very upset, but ends up marrying Charles Hamilton, Melanie's (also timid) brother to hurt Ashley. But war starts, and the men go off. Scarlett starts to realize that the war isn't just an exciting, little game, and she meets Rhett Butler. During the siege of Atlanta, I held my breath, anxious to see what was next. Scarlett ends up marrying twice again and has 3 children Wade, Ella, and Bonnie.Excellent book! The movie was great too, though it left out some things. But if you want to read more details than the movie, read the book.",
            "Although this is the longest book I've ever read in my life (1024 pages in my edition), it wasn't long enough, and it never could be. I loved this book, and now that I've read it all i can say is that I'm glad there's a sequel. From the first few paes the book catches the readers and and wraps them up in it's pages, carrying them along with the life of Scarlett O'hara. We laugh with her, cry with her, feel her her emotions as if they were our own. You cannot stop thinking about the book, even though your mind should be on other things. The only desire is to keep reading and find out more, until the book finally lets go. Then the reader is left alone and confused, wondering what has happened, and where the story has gone. The book is a masterpiece, a novel in perfection, and my only regret is that this scale only goes from one to ten, for Gone With The Wind deserves a 100.",
            "First and foremost, Gone with the Wind has no mundane narratives, heartwarming and heart-rending from page 1 to 1448, 1448 was not enough!Brace thyself to be swept away by the Old South. If you heard this is a novel which glorifies racism and the age of slavery, you are misinformed; magnanimity is quite a virtue fellow savant.A captivating theme supported by characters with character, what more dost thou needeth? GWTW is a Pre-Civil War novel which portrays the monstrous adversities Southerners were manhandled to weather upon the slaughter of their civilization and way of life. For those attempting to prevail over a disheartening tragedy, GWTW shall inspire thee to walk the path of Rhett Butler or Scarlett O'Hara, for it once had for I (I, a former Ashley), though I held onto my chimerical nature. Wikipedia relays an excellent analysis of the characters, better than my own.People believe Southerners were fighting to defend slavery and the Confederacy, and I am sure a number of the arrogant wealthy landowners were, but the majority of Southerners were simply defending their homes and those they love. What would you do if an army was en route to your town and will pillage, burn, and commit unspeakable horrors unto your town's women, welcome 'em with open arms? Unlikely, unless you are gutless or a damn fool. You would, like I, commit monstrous acts to all extents, even if it were to leave you a corpse. I can go into historical detail debunking many fallacies people have about those who fought for the Confederacy, but it would serve little purpose, try reading the quote at the end of this review. GWTW is a Pulitzer Prize winner, it is doubtful that it would have been awarded such an honor if it were based on a horde of slack-jawed yokels praising slavery. GWTW is a novel of epic proportions, I highly recommend it.The 1939 film cannot compare in depth to the novel itself, but it is damn good for 1939. Clark Gable's performance was praiseworthy, such fiery passion, and Vivien Leigh, wow! What a powerhouse she is, almost intimidating, but in a cute classy way, if that makes sense, especially when she says \"I will not listen-\" (p. 1306)Memorable scene:Scarlett: [pleads with Rhett as he is about to leave to join the Confederate Army] Oh, Rhett! Please, don't go! You can't leave me! Please! I'll never forgive you!Rhett Butler: I'm not asking you to forgive me. I'll never understand or forgive myself. And if a bullet gets me, so help me, I'll laugh at myself for being an idiot. There's one thing I do know... and that is that I love you, Scarlett. In spite of you and me and the whole silly world going to pieces around us, I love you. Because we're alike. Bad lots, both of us. Selfish and shrewd. But able to look things in the eyes as we call them by their right names.Scarlett: [struggles] Don't hold me like that!Rhett Butler: [holds her tighter] Scarlett! Look at me! I've loved you more than I've ever loved any woman and I've waited for you longer than I've ever waited for any woman.[kisses her forhead]Scarlett: [turns her face away] Let me alone!Rhett Butler: [forces her to look him in the eyes] Here's a soldier of the South who loves you, Scarlett. Wants to feel your arms around him, wants to carry the memory of your kisses into battle with him. Never mind about loving me, you're a woman sending a soldier to his death with a beautiful memory. Scarlett! Kiss me! Kiss me... once...[he kisses her]Random quote from Gettysburg (1993):\"Virginians! Virginians! For your lands! For your homes! For your sweethearts! For your wives! For... Virginia! Forward... march!- Brigadier General Lewis Armistead",
            "I know, I know: another review of GWTW?Yes.Why? Because even after 72 years and billions of kudos, GWTW is still underrated. I was skeptical when I picked it up. But MM is one of the greatest writers of the 20th century, and she immediately hooks the reader. And she never lets up. And she spends the last third of the novel sucker-punching the reader over and over and over again, with each twist and turn more painful than the last. There's no one left to root for at the end of the book, and that's as it should be. Because it becomes clear that the characters in this novel (the adults, anyway) have all been playing a variety of dangerous games and, just like real life, they have to pay the price in the end.Scarlett is smart and courageous, but in the end she pays a price for her selfish behavior. Rhett is also smart and courageous, but at the end of the book he's a broken mess groping for his dignity and sanity. Melanie remains sane and dignified, but she's selfless to a fault (a characteristic which leads to her demise), and Ashley...well...This book makes me weep every time I read it. And yet I've read it at least 100 times. And keep coming back for more. Too bad all the sequels are so bad, but there's some fabulous fan fiction out there.",
            "It's hard to believe that I'd never read GWTW. I've seen the film multiple times and I know a bit about the history of the novel. _Gone With the Wind_ sold more than 1,000,000 copies in the six months after it was released in 1936, and a year later Mitchell was awarded the Pulitzer prize for her effort. It's certainly one of the best-loved books of our century, with fans ranging from feminists who are trying to reclaim Scarlett to groups like the United Daughters of the Confederacy.So when I picked up the book, my biggest question was whether or not it was worth so much fuss and adoration. I suppose that my answer has to be 'yes'. Mitchell's writing style is occasionally uneven and it took me 50 pages to get used to her diction, but the story is so sweeping and the characters so well-realized that all concerns about style and tone were lost in the experience of the book.In many ways, I found the book a much stronger story than emerges in the film. Unhampered by censorship, the world that Scarlett moves in in the book is much uglier than the one in the film-- painful miscarriages, brothels, wounds and poverty fill Mitchell's picture of the post-war south and make Scarlett's character much stronger and much less petulant than she emerges in the film.Although daunting in length, I found that the pages literally flew by, and I was sorry in the end when the story closed. Definitely a 'should read'.",
            "Unlike the movie, this book is NOT a \"romance novel\"; it's a hard-hitting account of Southern life during the Civil War, told from a Southern point of view, told as if from the period. The racist attitudes of the time, though naturally, entirely unsavory from today's point of view, existed, and denying it won't erase the facts. Mitchell WASN'T trying to make a statement of ANY kind, pro or con; she merely wrote on how things were, as opposed to how one wished they might be, or wished them to be different. The dichotomies between black and white life are entirely realistic, and to portray them as anything otherwise would be foolhardy. The only way to know how ghastly our history was in terms of its treatment of humanity is to preserve the facts as they were, and this book, without even trying, does exactly that.Too, it would be a serious mistake to paint this book as an idyllic, romantic love story. Mitchell, to her credit, does not fall back on dime-store novel clich&eacute;s, and unfortunately, she is rarely accorded respect for this. Because of the movie, an entirely different, not altogether flattering, slant permeates the whole \"Gone With The Wind\" phenomenon - and which debased Mitchell's intentions in the appalling Alexandra Ripley sequel.If everyone who saw the film had read the book, realization might be more widespread as to how they differ, and how much more complex and sharply drawn are the characters.Scarlett and Rhett are two unapologetic opportunists who are startlingly lacking in typical \"storybook\" appeal. Instead, their \"appeal\" is in how earthy and shrewd they both are, survivors by discarding public approval and approbation. In the end, both are humbled (\"redeemed\" is too strong a word) by life and their chronic misunderstanding of each other - and wind up, naturally, alone. Mitchell, shrewdly enough, in a rare move of unsentimentality, does not go the \"happily ever after\" route - Rhett leaves Scarlett, ruthlessly, abruptly. How could Butler, after being so shabbily treated, retain his self-respect by staying with Scarlett? All the other characters are drawn with wonderful strokes of originality and vividness - human, flawed and far more appealing than the pastel versions portrayed in the film.Mitchell was an incredible vernacular writer, and her skills in doing so emphasized the differences between all the cultures, classes and races. Astonishing is Mitchell's ability to combine history, social commentary and fiction with unbelievable ease; after several hours of reading, the reader may feel as though he had been in a virtual time machine, so indelibly detailed are the locales, weather, sounds and even smells. Even more absorbing are the marvelous dialogues between the characters, especially those of Rhett and Scarlett. Mitchell had a grasp as to how humans interact through words, and unlike, say, Ayn Rand, the conversations sound as if they are spoken by real people.Finally, though, for those who thought that Mitchell was Olde-Tyme in her attitudes and conventions because she was able to depict them so vividly, I suggest the reader pay close attention to the character of Rhett Butler, and his disdain for Old South values. Mitchell pulled a fast one by revealing, through Butler's character, just how modern a thinker she was. Butler repeatedly upbraids Scarlett for her early adherence to an antiquated \"value system\" and mockingly scorns the society around him. He sees what a sham and fakery of all the conventions that exist, and of having to accede to a mass-mentality. Through Rhett Butler, Mitchell slyly tucks in her own incredibly multi-faceted, intellectually-based mindset.Mitchell's book is one of the true greats in American novels.",
            "Roseywater, I don't like this book because it is racist. According to your \"racist\" point of view we all should consider that the Odissey is not a good work because it is also racist, we shouldn't like \"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\" because it is racist, we shouldn't like \"The Great Gatsby\" because it is classist, etc, etc, etc.You should leave out that way of criticism and appreaciate the essence of human relations that surfaces in this wonderful story. The book is not racist, some characters are. But remember this is a book that explores how people were in the 1860s in the Southern US and it would be unrealistic if some characters, or many of them, were not portrayed as racist.",
            "Thirty plus years ago, I lived and breathed \"Gone With the Wind\" in one huge, invigorating, life-changing gulp. I am writing this review because there is a whole new generation out there that should be exposed to this ground-breaking book.Epic in scope at over 1,000 pages, \"Gone With the Wind\" is a story of the Civil War, set in the deep South. The central charater is the infamous Scarlett O'Hara, a tempestuous, beautiful southern belle who secretly loves Ashley Wilkes, a childhood friend who marries his saintly cousin Melanie. At their engagement barbeque, Scarlett meets the dashing, mysterious Rhett Butler, the black sheep of a distinguished Charleston family. This event marks the last day of their antebellum lives, and sets the stage for the ravages of war that follow. Covering a time frame of roughly twelve years, \"GWTW\" is also a story of the new South that rises from the ashes of the old.Scarlett, one of the most indelible characters of modern fiction, is ruthless and selfish, a survivor and a fighter. A feminist long before her time, Scarlett pays dearly for the choices she makes. Rhett is a more complex individual with one weakness. He hides his love for Scarlett, prefering to pop in and out of her life until he \"catches her between husbands\". It is Rhett who is the more sympathetic character, deeply intelligent, self-mocking and sometimes heartbreakingly sad. Rhett, in spite of his worldly ways, is more representative of the old south, while Scarlett depicts the new.\"Gone With the Wind\" is fabulously well-written, plotted and researched. It has been criticized as racist, and it is so. No author today could get away with these portrayals of African Americans. But you have to remember that this book was written in the 1930s. Keep that in mind if you become angry. Personally, I feel that Mammy is one of the strongest, noblest women to appear in a work of fiction.This work is a must read for everyone. Savor it, reread it and be moved as many before you have been.",
            "The book was excellent, however it was missing page 713. It had page 813 in its place. Therefore the book had page 813 displayed twice in the book. I also went to a local bookstore and noticed all 4 books by this publisher had the same problem.",
            "Does anybody not already know the story? Well just in case, be warned there are spoilers ahead.First, let's get this out of the way: Margaret Mitchell's \"Gone With the Wind,\" a story of the Civil War and Reconstruction in Georgia, is racist, and it paints a falsely idyllic portrait of slavery. There's no getting around it. Blacks are depicted as the functional equivalent of small children or draft animals who are best off under the loving care and protection of their white masters. They fulfill a narrative role similar to that of the dog Enzo in \"The Art of Racing In the Rain,\" devoted servants who are sometimes loyal to the point of heroism, and occasionally wise observers of their owners. Slave owners are kindly taskmasters, willing to spend thousands of dollars to buy slaves they don't need from other plantations to keep families together, loath to use harsh words or inflict discipline, and generously concerned with their slaves' physical and spiritual welfare. Slaves laugh in their cozy cabins and have comfortable clothes, plentiful food and attentive medical care. The \"better class\" of slaves recognize how good they have it and stay with their masters after the Emancipation Proclamation. Abolitionists are ignorant outsiders who don't want anything to do with black people and who can't even imagine the family feeling masters share with their slaves. You can make all the excuses you want about where Margaret Mitchell was from, the stories she heard as a child, and prevailing attitudes when this book was published in the 1930s. I know of no other American novel of comparable \"classic\" status that contains such a sustained portrayal of slave owner benevolence and black inferiority.That said, and I don't think these concerns are small matters, \"Gone With the Wind\" works brilliantly as a popular novel. To be sure, it has its flaws. If you like minimalism, you will find much of the prose overripe. There are more characters and scenes than are strictly necessary, even allowing for the vast historic scope of the story. I could do with a bit less wallowing in the red clay soil of north Georgia. The operatically star-crossed romance of Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara does not bear too close inspection.GWTW works so well nonetheless because Margaret Mitchell is touched with genius when it comes to structure, pacing, and characterization. As another reviewer put it, she has incisive insight into the human heart. She also has the good sense to leave her readers guessing all the way to the end. We can each draw our own conclusions as to whether Scarlett will get Rhett back. Aspiring novelists and novelists who want to write better novels would do well to study GWTW regularly.Reading this book again for the first time in decades, after many heart-fluttering trips through as a dreamy, lonely adolescent girl, I was floored by Mitchell's skill at setting scene after scene that grabs the reader's attention, drives the story forward, and tempts you to read \"just one more\" until the clock is ticking into the small hours of the morning and the sky through the crack in the window blind slips from black to gray. Mitchell's prose flows (sorry, cliche ahead) like a clear, swift-moving stream. It's not the highest art, but it's miles above most popular fiction.The characters, archetypes though they may be, are as vividly alive as any I can remember. Even before I re-read GWTW, I could, from memory, have told you all about Scarlett's childish willfulness, shrewd business acumen, lack of insight, fierce love of the land and insane commitment to keeping her word. I'd forgotten her occasionally touching acts of kindness, such as when, after her father dies in a riding accident, she gives his gold watch to his body servant, Pork, with no visible ulterior motive. I could have told you about Melanie's steely gentility, Ashley's dreamy weakness, Mammy's wisdom, Gerald O'Hara's sweet madness, and Ellen O'Hara's suicidal devotion to duty as she saw it. Rhett Butler is a wonderfully complex, infuriating character whose conflicts and sorrows come from his being a gentleman (at least by the standards of his culture) in spite of his own better judgment. The fact that people react so strongly to Scarlett, Rhett and the rest, favorably or not, is testament to Mitchell's having made them so real that we believe in them even when our rational minds suggest we do otherwise.Mitchell does a remarkable job capturing universal human emotions and frailties: the fearful, loving relationship a small child has with his mercurial mother, the wisdom that there can be happiness only when like marries like, the stubborn folly of romantic regret, the pain and blame that come to a couple when a beloved child dies, or the inability to see others as they really are, whether it's the strength of steel under a genteel, innocent exterior or a vulnerable, devoted heart lurking behind a sardonic facade.Every tragedy needs its comic relief. A seldom-noted feature of GWTW is Mitchell's humor. She directs a sharp wit at the hypocrisy of Old Guard Atlanta and affectionate humor at the child characters she, a childless woman herself, handles with such insight and aplomb.Pat Conroy's introduction does a nice job as far as it goes in explaining how GWTW shaped the inner lives of generations of women, especially Southern women and how it will always be popular in countries that lost a war. Beyond that, I think GWTW's popularity endures in spite of its cringe-inducing attitudes for a couple of reasons. First, it's an early story of female self-sufficiency. Driven by fear of poverty, aided by a sharp mind, a solid work ethic and scruples that are none too fine, Scarlett makes her own money. Not for her the ladylike impoverished widow's pursuits of millinery, baking, or boardinghouse operation, or the unladylike pursuit of a brothel. Instead, she goes into the building trades, buying and running lumber mills, competing as sharply as any man in the business. Second, it's a quintessentially American story of, as Mitchell herself put it, \"gumption.\" In the world of GWTW, anyone with enough gumption can triumph over any adversity. GWTW reflects something so deeply ingrained in the American psyche that it will have an audience as long as anybody anywhere believes in the American archetype of the self-made person.In spite of its flaws, GWTW deserves its place in the top rank of popular fiction.",
            "This book was wonderful. I love reading about the south and the Civil War era is a wonderful back drop for the story of the spoiled southern belle Scarlett, and the dashing Rhett. I personally feel that this book is the mother of historical romance and will last the test of time. I read this book the first time when I was 12 or 13 and re-read it again as an adult. My memory of this story was not altered by the length of time between these reads.Better then the movie and wonderfully descriptive with real characters that grow as a result of their experiences you will not be disappointed with this book.",
            "5+ stars! I have read Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind 3 times over my 60 years and it still ranks in my top 2 greatest books ever written. It is an American Masterpiece. A classic of its time. Epic in scope, it is simply a good story that you never want to end. Happy, sad, contrite, vengeful, mean, loving, mysterious, hypocritical; yes, it has all the human emotions and foibles of life and more. To borrow a line from Charles Dickens' Tale of Two Cities: \"It was the best of times, it was the worst of time\", but most of all it was their times.One of the vary best books ever written concerning character development. Ms. Mitchell was superb. Her use of emotion and empathy made the characters come alive and it was as if they were in the room with you.To say more about this wonderful American classic would be redundant and hyperbole.It is an absolute must read. A true American classic masterpiece.*Note: I have seen the movie many times and it too is an American classic. Stunning in character portrayal and scenery. BUT, the book has the broad scope and in-depth character development that the movie could never portray unless it was many hours longer. Simply put, The book Rules!!",
            "A fourteen year old who loves to read almost anything under the sun:I loved this book. When I was in seventh grade I checked it out of our little school library because it had a lot of points--we'd read books, take a test, and receive a certain number of points for that book. If we got everything correct, we got full points, and we needed many points to pass English every trimester.I didn't realize I was going to fall in love with the characters. Each person is beautifully made, intricate, and unique. You grow to know everyone in the story. Margaret Mitchell doesn't let any detail slide. She describes Scarlett beautifully.Scarlett is perhaps the most interesting character I've ever read. I hate her completely, and yet love her just the same. She was the most spoiled brat, and yet I felt like I was part of her, or she was part of me.Also, Margaret Mitchell does a good job of justifying the Confederate's reasons for breaking off from the United States. Although I don't agree with slavery at all, I could see where the southerners came off, believing as they did, and even felt a little angry at the northerners for being so hotheaded themselves.For those of you who have seen the movie and liked it, buy this book, its ten times better. And for those of you who disliked the movie, still get the book. It is very much different from the movie, you get in the whole world, and they left out so much in the movie. For instance, Scarlett ... well, just read it, it's good.",
            "While I admit to not being a fan of the romance genre, Mitchell's &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; towers above its imitators in style and substance. Set in the Atlanta area during the Civil War era, Mitchell's story exemplifies the proper writing of historical fiction, with painstaking accuracy of language, mannerisms, and morals. The war itself is also presented as it should be presented - in full color and with all its moral ambiguity, rather than the black-and-white presentation that so often is the norm in modern discourse.Mitchell's painting of southern culture and the all-encompassing war, however, serve only as the background for one of the most poignant love stories ever written. Following the life and loves of the willful Scarlett O'Hara, the work delves straight into the meaning and nature of love. Torn between her now-married childhood love, Ashley, and the outcast Rhett Butler, and in dogged pursuit of financial success after the devastating war, Scarlett lives a life of emotion and passion that few fictional characters have rivalled.Though this work is quite long, it is a very easy read. The style is light and brisk, the language uncomplicated except in the heavy dialect of the blacks, and the story compelling. &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; is a great book, a great movie, and perhaps the greatest love story ever told. Highly recommended.",
            "What a thumping good read! Unright-on and politically incorrect it may be, but frankly my dear... This book contains all things horrid - racism, slavery, going for your best friend's man (and your sister's!), cruelty to animals and unfortunates, deforestation, to name but a few. But so what? The characters are so strong they could be placed in any walk of life and flourish. OK, maybe not that insipid piscean-like Ashley Wilkes, but he should've been drowned at birth anyhow! How Scarlett could've been gagging for him for any longer than a couple of weeks is a mystery to me, but I guess he was a challenge (no wonder Rhett felt inadequate!). To be fair, the book does goes on a bit in parts, and I feel Margaret Mitchell could've employed her journalistic skills and been a little more succinct. There are a number of characters that I see no need for and having seen the film so many times, I believe she could have honed her dialogue more. But Mags is so much kinder to Scarlett than Victor Fleming is in the movie. On film Scarlett is portrayed as a ball-breaker - which to a certain extent she most commendably is! - whereas in the book we see her thought processes and we understand why she is like she is. She's a tough cookie who is simply unprepared to have nothing 'coz her contemporaries harp on about honour and the good old days. She's MOVIN'! Plus in the book we see a far darker Rhett than the role interpreted by Clark Gable. He's cool, he's a bad boy, he's loaded, but let's face it, the guy's got problems! He knew what he was getting into when he met Ms O'Hara, but he still pursued her for years. He's got some gall to turn round and moan that she isn't the way he wanted her to be, believing he could have changed her and made her love him. And then when she discovers it for herself... well Scarlett, the game's over! I'm not interested anymore. But hey, we still love him, he still packs a punch more than Frank, Charles and that stupid Ashley and he keeps you guessing. Does she get him back? Probably eventually. Scarlett has screwed up by being such a foolhardy hothead, but give her a break! With Melanie gone, she's got no pals and you know Scarlett will honour her promise and look out for Ashley... urgh! With any luck the man will get abducted by aliens and everyone can get on with their lives!",
            "Being a guy this is kind of hard for me to admit, but this is the best book that I have ever read to date. I know that this is a \"chick book\" but I found it completely fascinating. I learned much more about the civil war from this book than I ever did from a history book or a classroom. I also learned about the origination of the KKK, all about slavery and all about real southern hospitality. There is so much more to this book than just a great story. You actually get to feel what it would have been like to grow up and live on a plantation before, during and after the civil war. I believe that this book should be read by everyone because of its historical value even though the story itself is fiction. I have read very few books where you really know and feel for the characters like you do in GONE WITH THE WIND.",
            "Set in the Civil War era in Georgia, Margaret Mitchell's runaway classic Gone With the Wind is the spellbinding historical fiction of the world's best-known southern belle Scarlett O'Hara and the infamous Rhett Butler. The book was later made into one of the most successful films in history, starring Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable as the love-to-hate main characters. Normally, one would despise a person so spoiled and selfish as Scarlett, but Margaret Mitchell writes the emerald-eyed belle and the other characters in the book as multi-faceted, understandable characters, all with surprisingly human emotions and interactions. Through all of her struggles in the course of the novel, Scarlett stays strong, and in the end her will survives and she concludes a strong woman hopeful of what tomorrow will bring. Gone With the Wind is magnificent in its entirety, so complete with accurate historical facts and an unpredictable plot. The narrator follows Scarlett through years of her life, pre-, neo- and post- civil war, building at a quick pace. Scarlett rises again after the deaths of many close to her, after her failed marriage to Rhett, after going home to her beloved plantation of Tara during Reconstruction to find everything gone, and after her unrequited love for Ashley. The book closes with Scarlett pronouncing the famous words, &quot;After all, tomorrow is another day!&quot; Poignant and absolutely enchanting, Gone With the Wind is a book I would recommend to anyone. It cannot be guaranteed that you will enjoy it as I did, but from reading this novel you will gain insight about a true struggle and eventual survival.",
            "I recently downloaded the book, `Gone With The Wind' to my Kindle. It's not because I haven't read the book - far from it! Like millions of readers world-wide, I have already savoured every page of this best-selling listed book of all time in hardback, at least twice so far. I was 6 years old when my grandmother first noticed me looking intently at her copy of `Gone With The Wind' in her bookcase. And it was shortly after my grandmother passed away a few months later that the very same book was placed gently into my hands to keep (as was her request).There have been so many book reviews about `Gone With The Wind', authored by Margaret Mitchell, that I was almost tempted not to write this review. It seems somewhat pointless in repeating what has already been written countless times about this masterpiece, and the only book ever published by this author in 1936, who received a Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for it, in 1937. With over 30 million sales, a film, and sequel attempts by other authors in attempts to keep the `Gone With The Wind' saga alive, it is a book well known, world-wide.For those unfamiliar; set in the state of Georgia, southern United States in 1861, `Gone With The Wind' is the story of the high spirited, un-conforming southern belle Scarlett O'Hara and her tumultuous struggles of the heart, with (southern gentleman) Ashley Wilkes and (charming rogue) Rhett Butler. But it is not just a romance novel; it is also a novel bathed in American history, and the story of a young woman's determination and strength of will to save her beloved plantation home called Tara in any way possible, through times of the American Civil War and the early years of Reconstruction.I cannot recall why I was so captivated by this book when I looked at it on my grandmother's book shelf all those years ago (it did not have a colourful outside cover). I certainly wasn't at an age to fully comprehend the contents of it, despite the fact that as a child growing up in the Australian bush in the 1960's, reading was a huge part of my childhood, especially as my mother and grandmother were both teachers. However, once I read the book I realised that my grandmother would have known I would relate to Scarlett's love of the land; her home, Tara, which she fought to protect at any cost.My favourite excerpts:-Gerald O'Hara (Scarlett's father): `'Do you mean to tell me, Katie Scarlett O'Hara, that Tara, that land doesn't mean anything to you? Why, land is the only thing in the world worth workin' for, worth fightin' for, worth dyin' for, because it's the only thing that lasts.''\"Somewhere, on the long road that wound through those four years, the girl with her sachet and dancing slippers, had slipped away, and there was left a woman with sharp green eyes, who counted pennies and turned her hands to many menial tasks, a woman to whom nothing was left from the wreckage, except the indestructible red earth on which she stood.\"`Gone With The Wind' will appeal to readers for so many different reasons. I highly recommend it!J M Lennox",
            "Oh wow!! I was utterly and completely engrossed with this book. Mitchell did an incredible job on being very descriptive of everything. As I read I can really picture the scenery, the characters, and the war especially. Scarlet annoyed me and it was devastating how selfish, cruel, and cold hearted she was. Nevertheless, I couldn't put the book down. I was interested to see on what would become of her and Rhett, and Melanie and Ashley. The ending was a tear jerker for me especially for what happened to Melanie. The author did well on creating so much depth into this novel. Don't be intimidated by the long and many pages of this book. It was worth reading.",
            "Saying you know the story of \"Gone With the Wind,\" because you've seen the movie is like saying you know Kansas from watching \"The Wizard of Oz.\" Compressed and with composite characters, the brilliant movie doesn't hold a candle to the novel upon which it is based. The novel has undergone much criticism, for black dialect (which we studied, along with other dialects in History of the English Language), for rosy portrayals of slavery, and for being a forbidden romance that happens to have the Civil War as its background.\"Gone With the Wind,\" is more than a novel; it is an experience. Scarlett O'Hara is devout with faith---in herself, and is a survivor. The true tragedy of the book is that she is blinded by her ignorance into ignoring true love when it was present, and longing after an idealized love with a married friend. The book is lush with descriptions of the period, and very accurate in its detail. Scarlett is externally strong, with fragile emotions, while her foil Melanie Hamilton Wilkes is internally strong, with character and devotion that run deep. Ashley Wilkes is rather pathetic in that he never has the integrity to admit a lust for his childhood friend Scarlett but not romantic love, while Rhett, in many ways like Scarlett, and older and wiser, loves her for who she really is, not the face that society of the time demands she show in public. The story is mostly about character development in the face of tragedy, and shows three survivors with one \"displaced person,\" forever malcontent in the new world that the War has created, out of place, sad, and futile.A word about the slavery element: slavery was NOT a good thing. Not all slaves were named after their owners or treated as trusted members of the family or confidantes. Aside from Rhett, Mammy is the only person who knows Scarlett, what she is capable of, and chastises her for her lack of morals or values. I feel her character is critiqued based upon her speech patterns, not her actual actions. With the exception of Prissy, none of the African-Americans appear to be ridiculed or used for comic effect, nor do stereotypes surface. Pork, Dilcey, Mammy, and Prissy are fortunate that the emotional ties they shared with the O'Haras continued so much that they remain as paid staff after being freed. Cruelty from others is also depicted, usually in the form of Northerners who didn't understand the way of life.What remains is a tale of what happens when one's way of life and world are turned upside down, and how the principal character handles it, and relates with the others, failing at times to recognize the quality of friendship from her sister-in-law Melanie and the weakness of Ashley Wilkes. I quite wonder if Mittie Bulloch Roosevelt felt this way, when the enchanting Clayton County belle (from whom some of Scarlett's physical traits seem drawn) moved to New York State with new husband Theodore Roosevelt, Sr.While not all elements of the novel are positive, GWTW is a snapshot album of life during the Civil War and Reconstruction.",
            "In my humble opinion, Gone with the Wind is THE great American novel. It is brilliant, incredibly well-written, and highly enjoyable to read. It is at times charming, romantic, or bitingly funny, and at other times dark, cold, or heartbreaking. And always, it has the Civil War-era history as its dramatic backdrop. Its characters are fascinating and complex, though FAR from perfect. This book has everything, and its appeal is timeless.I first read the book as a young girl, after a couple of friends at school has been reading it and were enthralled by it when we were all about 13. I read it starting one Christmas break, and could hardly put it down. It's such a long epic, yet so fast-paced, that you just become lost in it. That's the very best way to enjoy a novel- to just become fully engrossed. The way it worked out for me was perfect too, because when I read it that first time, I had never seen the movie. (My parents had probably watched it a few times when I was little, since they love the movie, but I was too young to pay much attention). I knew nothing about the characters or storyline before reading it, and that just made it all the better. Of course, at that age I loved Rhett Butler and the love story aspect the most! Some of it was over my head or too \"worldy\" for me to understand then. Realizing this, I have since read the book again as an adult (I'm now in my late 20's and have seen the movie several times also). I loved the book just as much as the first time around, and certainly as an adult I got much more out of the historical elements, descriptions of the countryside, and the whole storyline.I would really encourage anyone who has only seen the movie to read the book. I do love the movie; It was incredible for its time, and is a classic itself; but to me it doesn't even compare to the book. Just watching the movie, you only get a sense of the most shallow outline of the story, without understanding much of its depth, character development, or wit. This is especially true in the second half, which was a bit rushed in the movie.A slight pet peeve of mine: Some people comment on Gone With the Wind being \"racist\" or \"sexist,\" as if that somehow detracts from its quality. Quite the contrary...Not only is that overstating the obvious, that's part of the point!! OF COURSE the characters' racist viewpoints were condescending and horrible. But they were historically realistic. The entire nation of the 19th century was shamelessly racist, especially aristocracy in the deep South, and this story is told from their point of view. Why read classic literature or historic fiction at all, if the past must be sugar-coated for modern sensibilities? There is nothing to be learned from that. OF COURSE some of the attitudes toward ladies seem old-fashioned now. That goes without saying. But that is part of its charm and helps to explain why Scarlett is as conniving as she is. She's no fool! The Old South had its faults and cruelties (namely slavery) but largely as a result of those faults, it also did not survive. GWTW portrays this fall. Thus, there is so much to be learned from the book, historically and morally. Its very brilliance is the way it captures a snapshot of that long-lost culture, from its most beautiful and genteel qualities to its faults that ended up being its downfall, and portrays it changing with the war. The Old South is \"gone with the wind\" but will forever be alive in the pages of this great American novel.Margaret Mitchell depicts the Southerners as what they were: just people, same as the Yankees, trying to defend their own and to sacrifice and to courageously fight for their side as they thought was right, in their stubbornly proud way. And after, when they had been humbled, they were trying to just pick up the pieces and survive, in a cruelly war-ravaged land. The only world they had ever known was ripped out from under them. Gone with the Wind follows Scarlett and our fictional storyline as it parallels every step of the historic timeline, through Reconstruction.In so many ways, Scarlett herself is like the South. In my mind, I feel like she represents the South. As the final page of the book describes, in one of my favorite lines: \"......With the spirit of her people who would not know defeat even when it stared them in the face, she raised her chin. She could get Rhett back.\"",
            "There's probably nothing I can say about Gone With the Wind that hasn't already been said, but I'm going to put in a plug for it anyway, because it's an incredible book and because a large number of people (most probably haven't read it) just don't get it--I'm talking particularly about those who think it's a romance novel.Gone With the Wind is incredible for its value as historical fiction. Written in the early 20th century by an author who grew up hearing stories about the Civil War and Reconstruction, it recreates that era far more successfully than any modern-day writer could. I've lived most of my life within a half-day's drive of Atlanta, but had never heard the South's perspective in the Civil War laid out as it is here. Some have complained that the book is racist, but to me, that's part of the point. This is no whitewashed, modern-day version of what Southerners thought in the 1860s; instead, it's a priceless and sometimes surprising reproduction of what they really thought and how that culture (very different from today's South!) operated.Aside from the beautiful portrayals of the people, places and events of the time period, there's some good action--those turned off by long books will be surprised at how readable this one is. The main characters, like them or hate them, are well-developed. And, yes, they have love lives. But then, we're modern readers, even if Scarlett isn't, so we should be used to that, right?",
            "I read this book as a little girl of nine or ten. Then I reread it and reread it until I practically had it memorized. No other book has affected me like this, and I've read many other books, including many of the great classics of literature. I have yet to find another Gone With the Wind.This book is life changing. To those who dismiss it as sexist racist trash, I would argue this: If describing reality as it is is sexist and racist, perhaps that simply reflects that there is a great deal of sexism and racism in reality. Were the people of the South prior and after the Civil War racist? Yes. Of course. Were these sexist times? Yes. Does it glorify sexism and racism.Perhaps. It is only fair to give this last question some consideration. There are sentiments in this book that are racist. I think of the feelings expressed of longing for the old days, the days of slavery, expressed by the main characters. But these are certainly feelings that were held by the people who clung so steadfastly to that way of life.I do not agree that all of the African Americans were portrayed as stupid. Even Prissy, in her own way, was not stupid. She was a detestable character, black or white, but not necessarily stupid, just daydreamy. But Mammy is anything but stupid. She certainly has a greater understanding of Scarlett than Scarlett's own mother ever did.Sexist?I don't know if this makes me a \"sexist\" but I have never identified with a character as much as I did Scarlett. It was as if I were reading the thoughts in my own head. She is manipulative, headstrong, stubborn, narcissistic, a dreamer, a romantic, and ultimately a realist, who stays in reality, and stays strong by clinging to certain rocks as her world changes around her. Rocks like her farm, Tara. And I love that. I love that when everything else is blown away from her, she clings to the things she learned to value in her childhood. \"Land,\" her father had told her, \"Land is the only thing worth fighting for.\"This book has given me strength throughout my life. I don't cling to the land, because I have none to cling to. But I cling to the things that give me a sense of something permanent and unchanging in my world, and especially when times seem unstable, and change seems to ruthlessly rip out all the familiar structures I have around me.",
            "I absolutely loved this book! I have to admit that when I first started reading the book, I had no idea what it was about. I read the beginning and was apauled to find out that I was reading a book about slave owners (I was a bit close-minded). After many assurances from family members that it was a very good book, I continued reading...and could not put it down.This book opened my mind to alot of possibilities. I really liked seeing the civil war from this perspective. Even though this is a fiction book, it did shed a different light on some of the events that took place in that time period. I enjoyed learning about some of the customs of this period and why they had them.Scarlett's constant battle with who she is and who she wants to be makes for some interesting situations. I found my own ideas of the characters changing with every page as new information was given of each one. Though I didn't like some of Scarlett's choices, I was able to understand why she made each one. You never know when something good or bad is going to happen in this book...it could be the next paragraph.This is a really long book, but it's worth every page. I think Margaret Mitchell did a great job writing it. It will definately be a book that I recommend to everyone I know.",
            "I had always been a fan of the movie adaptation of Maragret Mitchell's \"Gone With the Wind\" but I had never gotten around to reading the book (I know--BAD READER!) so when I saw audible had a version of GWTW available, I decided to try it out. It's a long book but I figured my familiarity with the story line would help me through it.Why did I wait so long to read this book--it was wonderful! So much more than the movie, with additional detail and real perspective on the characters. Those overwraught emotions make so much more sense after reading the book! Although there is a rich historical background in this novel, it's really about one woman's struggle against herself, her time, and her enemies.I also really enjoyed the narrator of this audio book. She did a wonderful job of bringing the story alive and giving depth to the different characters (with different voices and inflections) and had a wonderful way of telling the story.If you are a fan of GWTW the movie and have never read the book, I urge you to get out there and find a copy. You won't be disappointed with this rich historical drama.",
            "romance, history, tears... the book is a master piece... if the ending gave me more, i would have jumped with joy but... still it is a really good book... teaches you from the perspective of the south and even makes you feel so sorry for scarlet... i never really liked rhett because he just didn't seem like he loved her.. i guess he sort of didn't.. well it was wonderful^^",
            "I read this book the first time when I was 14, after the re-release of the movie. I saw that the book had been re-released on a visit to the library, and checked it out. Well, a casual reader cannot read \"Gone with the Wind\" in the one week the library gives you for new books, so I bought this copy from Amazon, and took it with me on a 10 day vacation. Almost done reading it. Think I will read \"Scarlet\" next.",
            "It's a good story. And the typing is perfect, clear, and the language is totally understandable. It seems like I am right there listening, learning, and getting a full understanding of what is going on. It's wonderful. I haven't been able to finish it because of shakespeare reading, but I am rushing through William to get to Margret. Good writing. And a wonderful classic read.",
            "Wow, the civil war from the southern POV, who knew? Yes, racism is rampant, but I loathe history and I loved this book.",
            "I absolutely LOVED the book! I never would have read the book, but I read a review somewhere that someone said don't wait until you're 50 years old like her to read the book. It was very easy to read and I enjoyed the author's writing style. Even though the book was Fiction, Mitchell wrote it with realistic and actual events of the pre/post Civil War. I had a great and better understanding of why the Southerners thought the way they did about the Yankees and continue to grasp their love for their land, values, and ideals of the Old South even to this day.I had seen the movie, \"Gone with the Wind\" a few years back but didn't get a true appreciation of it of why it was such a great movie, and after reading the book, I purchased the DVD. Having read the book, it was easy to follow and understand the movie which doesn't always capture the true essence of the book.I am on a pursuit of reading classic novels and this was on my list. Take the time to read this book...it is quite large so it will take some time to read but is well worth it.",
            "This wonderful book deserves 10 stars at least. I just re-read it and, even now 30 years after I first read it, it still stands head and shoulders above any other work of fiction I've ever read.There is good reason why GWTW remains so enduringly popular. First of all is Margaret Mitchell's wonderful verbosity; this allows her to describe the physical setting in lush detail and to create characters of enduring interest and complexity. When it comes to characterization, no author I've ever read can even touch Margaret Mitchell's skill.But what also makes GWTW so enduring popular is its readability. Except for Scarlett's occasional \"Fiddle-dee-dee\" and \"God's nightgown!\" and the almost unintelligible dialogue of the blacks, Gone With the Wind reads like something written by a modern day author. The language is simple and direct and forthright, never complex or flowery. This gives the book a timelessness and makes it, even at 900+ pages, an amazingly fast read.Although reading GWTW this time as a middle-aged adult I found it far more tragic and sad and far less romantic, what I appreciated more about it was the background story and the way the author worked it seamlessly into her narrative. She vividly describes the effects of the war and Reconstruction on Southern society in a way that is evocative without ever sounding bitter or angry.If you've never read GWTW then you owe it to yourself to do so immediately if not sooner! Trust me, you'll never be sorry that you did. The characters of Rhett, Scarlett, Ashley and Melanie will become like real people who will live on in your mind forever.",
            "In time for the Diamond Anniversary of the publication of this formidable American classic, as well as the 150th anniversary of the Civil War that it depicts, I present my editorial musings about Margaret Mitchell's iconic literary piece.As an African American, it was a touchy and sometimes uncomfortable read for me. But as a child of Barbadians, my ancestors had been free for roughly 30 years by the time the story begins, and as subjects of the British Crown, had the option of attending British Universities, whereas America was on the verge of its most catastrophic war, in which slavery was a major issue, and Jim Crow laws would succeed slavery, I can and did read this novel with a little more detachment than most African Americans could.It took me 17 days to complete it, my eyes flowing faciley over the pages of the Avon Book rendition.Margaret Mitchell introduces her heroine, Katie Scarlett O'Hara, a willful green-eyed beauty of Franco-Irish descent, on an April day in 1861, where the 16-year-old is entertaining two suitors, the Tarleton Twins, on the front porch of her family's Georgia plantation, Tara.The lanky handsome red-haired Tarleton Twins, Stuart, and Brent, had been expelled from college,but were planning to join the Confederate Army, and they begin to aggravate their coquettish young hostess with their frequent talk of war. Scarlett threatens to go inside and lock herself away if they fail to change the topic of conversation, and is obliged. In due time, of course, the young Southern Belle would have to shed her preconceived notions about war as a gender-segregated issue, and accept it as everyone's business, regardless of gender.In the meantime, the topic turns to the upcoming barbecue at the neighboring Wilkes plantation, Twelve Oaks, where the handsome, blond Ashley Wilkes, whom Scarlet desires above all others, resides with his widowered father, John, and sisters, India and Honey. She learns Ashley will marry his cousin, Melanie Hamilton, who is sweet, delicate, and of a milder mold than she, who despises her.Literally turning into something of a green-eyed monster, Scarlett schemes to steal Ashley from Melanie--a central plot in the story.Her firey Irish father, Gerald, discourages her pursuit of Ashley, knowing such a union would be an unhappy one. Like most of the men closest to Scarlett, he had her best interest at heart.Her mother, Ellen Robillard O'Hara, from a notable French family from Savannah, tends to the plantation, nursing the sick, settling the accounts of the estate, and spending ample time delivering and baptizing the out-of-wedlock children of the impoverished Emmie Slattery, who are fathered by the O'Hara's Yankee overseer, Jonas Wikerson.Although better educated that the lowly Slatteries, his profession bars him from association with Georgia's upper echelon. So he turns to the lowly Slattereys for companionship.Ellen asks her husband to fire Wilkerson for his immorality, but Gerald refuses.Ellen appears too busy to really notice her oldest daughter's intrigues.The evening ritual of family prayers provides some temporary solace for Scarlett, who has quarreled with younger sisters Careen (baptized Caroline Irene) and Sue Ellen(baptized Susan Elinor). Servants Mammy, Pork, Dilcey, and Prissy stand guard as Ellen leads the family in Roman Catholic breviaries.Mammy knows Scarlett best, and calls her out as her charges prepares to attend the barbecue, but Scarlett has ways of manipulating Mammy to get her way.At the barbecue, Scarlett shines. In due time, it is revealed that all the men who will play a pivotal role in her life are there. She gathers her suitors under a tree, flushed and flirtatious.In the meantime, a mysterious man from Charleston with a murky reputation has his eye on the raven-haired beauty. As Scarlett is winning men's hearts, this man, Rhett Butler, earns the ire of the same men by giving them a realistic account of their chances of defeating the Yankees, as he has visited Northern factories, and areas of that region many of John Wilkes' guests had not.Gradually, it will be seen that Rhett Butler is right, and most of the men quarreling with him are dead.Slipping away from the rooms where the young ladies are napping, Scarlett confronts Ashley in the library to reveal her feelings, and is gently rebuffed. In a tearful rage, she slaps the man she claims to love and throws a china bowl decorated with roses, smashing it, and startling Rhett, who had been sleeping on the couch, initially out of her sight. Her response to his remarks about her behavior reveal her to be unsure of her own mind where Ashley is concerned.Amid Scarlett's dealing with the hurtful sniping of other young ladies, the word gets out that recruits are called for and all eligible men, including Ashley, rush off to enlist.A moment of desperate jealousy towards Ashley and Melanie leads Scarlett into an ill-conceived union with Melanie's brother, Charles--the day before Ashley and Melanie's marriage--. Charles dies of illness while at war, leaving Scarlett widowed and pregnant with their son, Wade, with whom, like many parents in wartime, Scarlett will have difficulty bonding.During a visit with her Aunt Pittypat, the widow scandalizes Atlanta by dancing with blockade runner Rhett at a ball benefitting the troops, while clad in widow's weeds.The story follows the young beauty through nursing soldiers with Dr. Meade and a pregnant Melanie, her frustration with Prissy during Melanie's labor(Prissy's simplemindedness was most likely a ruse as it was for most slaves), and her perilous flight back to Tara from Atlanta despite bad weather and battles, during which Rhett journeys with her only part of the way before rushing off to enlist.With Melanie, Wade, Prissy and newborn Beau in tow, she returns to find Tara still standing, unlike Twelve Oaks, although blighted by soldier's lootings, Mammy, Pork, and Dilcey about the only remaining servants, her sisters ailing, her father non compos mentos, and her mother dead of typhoid fever contracted from nursing Emmie Slattery.Finding only rotten produce to eat, she vows to rebuild her life by any means necessary, and as the saying goes, \"There is nothing angrier than an educated Southern lady.\"Using all her cunning, education,and inner strength unleashed by harsh circumstances, she acheives her goal at the expense of many friendships, marrying twice more, bearing daughters Ella(by Frank Kennedy, the \"old maid in britches\" she steals from sister, Sue Ellen when she realizes his business can help pay the taxes on Tara) and Bonnie(by Rhett) along the way--the last of whose strong will matches her mother's, leading to grave consequences.In a very poignant ending, Scarlett does come to appreciate how much Melanie really means to her, seeing how her kindness and fortitude complemented and buttressed her own grit and determination, and she finally sees Ashley as a hopeless and perpetual dreamer in view of her own willingness to face and deal with life's realities head-on.Intriguing characters include the amputee soldier, Will Benteen,and the crude Hillbilly, Archie, whose history proves the practice of Honor Death was not confined to Mid-Eastern culture. Both show how the war brought disparate social groups together, as does Madame Belle Watling.The political incorrectness, mysogyny, and racism may ruffle a few feathers. But it is appreciated that these people were products of their time, although impressively, Scarlett's mother forbade her to use the \"N\" word.Still, this story is an American epic that reflects the resilience of a human spirit that never conceded defeat.I recall that during a televised airing of the film version of this epic in the early 1980s, the announcer referred to Scarlett as \"The Jewel of Tara\", and indeed, in facing life's great calamities, she does prove to be \"Diamond hard\".",
            "\"Burdens are for shoulders strong enough to carry them\"Tara Plantation, near Jonesborough, near Atlanta, GeorgiaKatie \"Scarlett\" O'Hara is the most charming Southern belle, gathering the attention of beaux all over the surrounding areas. But when she learns the man she had been psuedo-courting, Ashley Wilkes, is marrying Melanie Hamilton from Atlanta, his cousin, she schemes to win him back. When he refuses, she immediately marries Charles Hamilton in spite. But Civil War has come to the South, and Scarlett quickly finds herself a widow, stuck in Atlanta, with a child, unable to be the pretty belle she had been a few months prior. Will Scarlett ever get Ashley? What about the strange Rhett Butler character, who is constantly tweaking her? Will Scarlett and her family survive the war?Let me preface my review with this: I don't read a lot of historical fiction or chick lit or romance or anything. My speciality is science fiction, fantasy, and urban fantasy. However, this book absolutely, positively blew me away!At first, I found the novel a bit slow. There were so many characters, and at first, it seemed like nothing happened. But that wasn't to last. Quickly, I became interested in Scarlett's schemes to snatch Ashley away from Melanie, all the while hating her for her bad behavior. By the end of the book, there were points were I was in near tears.Scarlett wasn't my favorite character. She was a rude, bitter, selfish woman. But I completely understood her predicament. To the reader, she was completely honest, despising her first husband's death (and life!), her dislike of children (don't see that much in romance do we!), her dislike of women's poor station (always having to act \"silly\" in front of the menfolk), and taking the reigns of business to make a life of her own. So while I didn't like her, I also didn't hate her. I understood what she was trying to do and found myself rooting for her against the odds. She is a brilliantly written character, so dynamic, multifaceted and full.Melanie Hamilton was probably my favorite character. This might seem odd as she does come off as a Mary Sue--perfect and sweet to everyone, always right, yada, yada--and I hate Mary Sues. But I really never found Melanie a Mary Sue. Scarlett repeatedly downplays Melanie's beauty. Melanie is strong-willed and works diligently, but tires easily (such as when she works at Tara in the cotton fields). Like Scarlett, Melanie was definitely not a 1-D character. She appeared weak on the outside, while maintaining strenght in the face of danger, in the face of childbirth, in the face of hard times. She was a true inspiration to me.Rhett Butler made me so furious, sometimes I wanted to slap him like Scarlett! But other times, he was so charming and debonair, that I wanted to melt in his arms like butter. I loved how forthright he was, how practical and realistic he was, and yet how at times, his passionate nature came through (joining the Confederate army at the end, for example).Side characters, such as Miss Pittypat, Mammy, Dilcey, Pork, Uncle Peter, Mrs. Meade, Belle Watling, and more, jumped out at me. They felt like real people, people influenced by dreams, desires, and feelings. Probably one of the sweetest moments was when Dr. and Mrs. Meade were talking and she mentioned she would rather him be at Belle's than dead. Given what Mrs. Meade had been through, what she held dear, it was particularly poignant.I could go on endlessly about the amazing life lessons and themes and symbols in the book. Quotes about the status of women at the time, about changing with the changing times, about strength of character, about being who you are, and about what is really important in life abound in this book. Most of the ones that really touched me may be found on my profile page, though the whole book is brimming with it.As this deals with the South during the Civil War, there is much talk of slavery; one of the reasons, I believe, it has been so frequently placed on the Banned Books list. Some people believe that it shows slavery in a favorable light, that blacks were/are children that need to be tended by whites. My opinion is this: it shows how many white Southern plantation owners viewed slaves. Not all slave owners were Mr. Simon Legree of Uncle Tom's Cabin. Conversely, not all slave owners are like the O'Hara's. Yes, there are a lot of black stereotypes (Mammy, Prissy, etc.), but this is a snapshot into the past. You can't take this book and try to force modern views of civil rights and racism into it. However, I do believe it makes a brilliant discussion piece: comparing Scarlett and other Southern whites' views of blacks with other accounts (such as Uncle Tom's Cabin or the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn).All in all, this is a brilliant book, made more excellent by the narrator, who deftly interprets the Southern dialect and accents for the listener. I thoroughly enjoyed it and was heart-broken, but inspired, when it ended. I highly recommend, even to those, like me, who aren't big into historical fiction.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*",

            "I know this film so well and often quote dialogue but had never read the book. My first purchase on the Kindle and off camping. A thousand pages of southern saga sweeping off the page. It amazed me how the characters in the book are simply written descriptions of the eventual actors. You would recognise Clark Gable and Vivienne Leigh, even Melanie and Ashley like old friends. It was amazing. Also made me understand better a few things in the movie that were not clear to me - the Ku Klux Klan for example.If you are a fan of the movie but had never read the book - do so. It may be from the 1930's but the story holds, as does the film. Well worth the read and a great camping weekend relax.",
            "It's no wonder this is the second most sold book in history. The movie just doesn't do the book justice; the book really puts you in the south during the Civil War. Great read!",
            "It took me until age 35 to read this book. So glad I did! I read it over a two month span and was so sorry to reach the end.",
            "Truly a classic by Margaret Mitchell. This was one book I read and loved since high school days, and that was forty plus years ago. The literary style with its vivid descriptions is excellent - the unforgettable civil war of the late 1800's,the rebuilding of the beautiful Tara estate, and of course the emotional stirrings and passion of both Scarlet O' Hara and Rhett Butler. All these and more bring us back to the good old days and the lessons that we have learned to value through the times.",
            "BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ. I ORDERED FOR MY KINDLE AND I HAVE IN PAPERBACK. BUY AND ENJOY SCARLETT AND RHETT",
            "This is my second time reading Gone With the Wind (I read it once in high school) and it didn't disappoint the second time around. In fact, I think I love it even more now, with a little life experience under my belt. Just a pleasure to read.",
            "This is a rich, breathtaking classic that can (and should) be read over and over again. It is a long, long story spanning twelve eventful years, but it is definitely worth the time it takes to read. The book is like an epic - Margaret Mitchell's voice is powerful, poetic, wise. Characters are the most important element of a book for me, and this book has the most beautiful, complex, unique characters I have ever encountered in a work of fiction. Scarlett never ceases to amaze me - her resourcefulness and ambition are incredible for a woman of her time. It is incredible how tragedy transforms her - from flighty and carefree to a harsh, driven woman whose compelling desire is to return to the security and prosperity before the war. She is also a frustrating protagonist in her narrow-minded stubbornness and inability to understand others and her own heart. Rhett Butler is the other character in this novel that captivates me. Readers will love his subtle sarcasm, sharp wit, and suave mannerisms. It's impossible not to! He is the quintessential \"bad boy\" that countless authors have tried to recreate. But he runs deep too, especially in his love for Scarlett and sentimentality for the charm of the Old South.The historical fiction aspect of the novel is extraordinary as well. I fell in love with the deep South as Mitchell described it, even though I have no connection to that part of America. I never considered the plight of Southerners during and after the Civil War, but this book revealed its devastating effect on the people and customs of the South. Books about the destruction of a society rarely end happily. But it surprised and disheartened me when the author paralleled Scarlett and Rhett's love story with the downfall of the South.",
            "I loved Gone with the Wind.. The time period was a crucial time for shaping America as we now know it. So many things stand out in my mind from the book but the one that I see the most is the relationship between Scarlett and Rhett. I think we know he loves her from the moment on the stairs at Twelve Oaks.. Scarlett to me seems like our modern day power hungry woman.. going against tradition in a mans world and proving a woman can survive..however she did marry Mr. Kennedy..but he was just a means to an end.. nothing more to her but a way to get what she wanted.. Then again like many modern day women her children were not anyone she really cared to be around and left them in the care of others while she worked hard to get the money she so wanted.. I think Scarlett always loved Rhett and did not know it till the end and when she found out she saw that she finally had all the money she could need but she did not have the one thing that could truley make her happy.. LOVE.. The story left me a little sad because of all that the people went through during those years of war and reconstruction.. but with those changing times we saw the freedom that so many deserved and the way of life of the South forever changed (regardless of those who can not seem to except that after all these years) I myself am a southerner and I can say that there were many things about the old south that seem magical..but so many others that were just plain wrong. Gone with the Wind shows so much of the Old South and of all the characters I think Mammy was the strongest and smartest of them all.. She was a woman that could tell you right from wrong in a world that you thought you knew everything and she stood by her \"family\" through more than blood kin would have.. Gone with the Wind is a must have on any book shelf.",
            "This is my all time favorite. My Nana lived five houses away from MM in Ansley Park, an Atlanta suburb. She pointed out the house many times, she must have thought I wasn't listening. Nana, a staunch Presbyterian finally broke down and read the book, considered somewhat scandalous. (my mother said that Nana disappeared for days until she finished it...and did like it) Margaret was a bit ahead of her time...wanting to be a journalist, to work where only men were permitted. Finally, just to get her off their back...The Atlanta Constitution hired her to cover the homicide division. She flourished.She married Red, then divorced him but they would \"meet up\" from time to time. Apparently there was ample chemistry. She fashioned Rhett Butler after her handsome rogue of a husband so much so that MGM required Margaret to get a release from him fearing some kind of lawsuit. He signed it gladly, happy for the likeness.I first read the book at age 16 and have since read it five more times. The research for its historical accuracy, the language, the complex characters, the rich texture of the tale and then the FABULOUS ending! Still impressive. Pulitzer Prize, movie, MM's only book, has moved me in a different way each time I sit down with it.",
            "Absolutely fantasic. This book was so good, even though I couldn`t stand Scarlett most of the time. All the different characters were ejoyable to read, and Rhett`s character had so many different layers that I was always trying to figure out just how much he cared for the unworthy Scarlett. READ THIS BOOK.",
            "I have had this book in my library for well over 10 years. I often picked it up, but never began to read it. I knew of all the hype about this being the great American epic novel and a Pulitzer Prize winner. I had seen the movie twice. The first time when I was maybe 8 when I saw it with my grandparents. The only thing I remember was asking my grandfather, \"Why is grandma crying?\" The second time I saw it, maybe five years ago, I was deeply disappointed in its lack of realism. Today's movies of blood and gore made the battle scenes and the long bloodless dolly shot of the wounded soldiers lying on the ground in Atlanta look plastic and fake. Another reason I neglected to read this book: 1024 pages. But, finally I decided to give it a shot, and am I glad I did. It is difficult to find the proper superlatives to use here. One plus, because of my busy schedule I had to read this in fits and starts, and it took over two months. However, author Mitchell has given us such strong and descriptive characters and has given so much detail to all of the plot twists and turns, that it was easy to return to the book and have complete remembrances of what has happened in the preceding pages. The story is compelling. Scarlett is a complex and fascinating heroine; Rhett her perfect antagonist. The minor characters all are well drawn. From the battle scenes, the aftermath, the period of reconstruction, what we have here is history come alive. I will cherish the hours I spent with this book. As a result, I will now search for a biography of Ms. Mitchell to learn why this was the only book this magnificent author ever wrote.",
            "I haven't been so engrossed in a book in a while. That's not to say I haven't read any good books lately, but there are some novels that take you hostage, laying siege to your thoughts until you can't think of anything else. You turn every single page, devouring them one by one. When it's over, you've ingested it and the story sticks inside you. It becomes so much a part of you that it's like looking through an old lens at something that happened to you a long time ago.Scarlett O'Hara has been forever ingrained in my brain as someone to aspire never to be like and someone to admire. She is completely oblivious to people and how they work-hurting feelings and breaking hearts-but she has gumption and ambition, which is admirable. Margaret Mitchell masterfully crafts a protagonist that is a completely different person on page 1,448 than she was on page 1, but still fundamentally the same. It's a brilliant blend of changing times and societies, a history lesson, a love story, a tragedy, and most of all a story of a person's capacity for change. I actually feel like there is nothing more I can say about this novel to do it justice.So, I suggest to anyone and everyone to read this book and not to be intimidated by the page count. It is honestly one of the best stories I've ever read; there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that this is rightly deemed a classic novel.",
            "I am a native Georgian, and I cannot believe I waited so long to read Gone With the Wind. Pat Conroy's new introduction finally got me to pick it up, and it simply is one of the best books I have ever read. It is magnificent. Winner of the Pulitzer Prize, it is a snapshot of a conquered nation and people - right here in the United States - and how they survive and persevere in the face of changing times, a lost war, and overwhelming odds.If your only exposure to Gone With the Wind is the film, you have so much more to discover. There are many important differences between the book and the film. ***SPOILER ALERT*** The book has many colorful characters sacrificed for the movie - Will Benteen, a Confederate Veteran who ends up running Tara and marrying one of Scarlett's sisters, Mrs. Tarleton (mother of the twins), Honey Wilkes (Ashley's sister), Uncle Henry Hamilton (Melanie and Charles' uncle), Dilcey (wife of Pork), and the much more fleshed out Aunt Pittypat and Belle Watling, just to name a few. In the book Scarlett has three children, one by each of her three husbands, instead of just Bonnie as portrayed in the film. Another major difference between the book and the film is that Rhett's motivations, background, and depth of feeling (and incredible suffering) comes through in the book in much more detail. In addition, by the end of the book I had a great affection for the quiet forgiveness, intelligence and iron-clad strength of Melanie that I felt was a bit lost in the film. Melanie truly is one of literature's greatest \"steel magnolias.\" ***END OF SPOILERS***I was very interested to read of Gone With the Wind's popularity overseas. It has been reported that the book has been translated into 40 foreign languages in 50 countries. It is amazingly popular in Japan, and in Germany more than 360,000 copies were sold by July 1941. I had never thought about it before, but Gone With the Wind was written during the late 1920's and 1930's about survival in the American south during and after the Civil War, at the same time Germany was suffering and rebuilding from its defeat in World War I. The European resistance movement during World War II found so much inspiration in the south's reaction to the Federal occupation in Gone With the Wind that the book was bootlegged during the war by the French Underground and other organizations. Orders actually went out from Germany at one point during World War II to \"seize all copies.\"During and after World War II people in rebuilding countries took the story of Gone With the Wind to heart. Margaret Mitchell stated, \"In practically every European country critics wrote at length of the 'universal historical significance.' Each nation applied to its own past history the story of the Confederate rise and fall and reconstruction. French critics spoke of 1870 (the Franco-Prussian War), Poles of the partitioning of their country, Germany of 1918 and the bitterness which followed, Czechs wrote not only of their troubled past but of their fears of the future, and I had letters from that country just before it went under (Nazi domination), saying that if the people of the South had risen again to freedom the people of Czechoslovakia could do likewise.\"The worldwide legacy of Gone With the Wind is truly astounding, and it all began right here in the Atlanta area with this book. Do not be put off by the book's size. Gone With the Wind is a real barn burner, and there is not a dull moment in the entire story. It is dramatic, brutal, romantic, amazingly intelligent, and quite shocking even by today's standards. The pages literally fly by. Read the first two chapters and if you are like me you will not be able to put it down. Margaret Mitchell's storytelling ability is an amazing thing to behold.Very highly recommended.",
            "This was my first read of \"Gone with the Wind\" and have to say it is by far some of the most vivid visual writing style I've encountered. The period style of writing and language used to describe scenery, events, people, class, style, emotions and action are simply riviting.Simply put: read the book.",
            "This was my first time reading this classic and I really didn't know what to expect. I had seen the movie version several times and in my opinion I really enjoyed the book so much more (Although the movie earns it's own merit's). It left me speechless and it really made me think about what Scarlett O'Hara had been through and it really made me for feel her and the other characters in the story. I was really impressed with the story Margaret Mitchell created. I can see why this got the Pulitzer Prize in 1937. If this has to be the book you choose for your next read, make it this one for sure!",
            "I read this book about 20 years ago, I am so glad I read again! Scarlett was ahead of her time and a very strong woman. Follow this book with the new Rhett Butler's People which I found very interesting.",
            "This is a new copy of an old favorite that I read to death. Have not read this one yet, but, I am sure that I will enjoy it as much as the other one.",
            "What a masterpiece! Enjoyed every chapter. Details in the book most interesting that were left out of the movie. Margaret Mitchell was a genius.",
            "I knew this book was a classic so I figured I would like the book. I didn't like it, I loved it. It took me three weeks to read but I still couldn't put it down. It kept me hooked to the end. I didn't know what to expect but it is a classic. Scarlett was a woman that was becoming modern but people and the times did not want it. I love her for what she did in the book and stood up for herself. The movie is as just as good as the book.",
            "This is a review YEARS in the making. First, I saw the movie on TV - bought the DVD and watch it at least once a year. Whenever I think of GWTW, I visualize Scarlett and her father at the oak tree at sunset...as the music swells. I enjoyed the story of a strong woman who truly believes that she is only trying to do her best for her family. Now. I said all that, to say this: the movie is nothing compared to the book! The book fleshes out the characters, life in the deep south, and the civil war. The book is long,yes, but there are no gratuitous descriptors - every word adds to your understanding of the people, the time, and the politics. After having the movie 'in my head' for so many years, believing that it was the story - I was delighted to find so much more in the book. I now read the book about once a year. This book is a must read for anyone whoever saw the movie; and for anyone looking for a real novel!",
            "This vivid tale of the Civil War and Reconstruction is not idealism (as reviews calling it racist imply) but realism. The rich characterizations and deep plot reveal its author to be one of profound understanding, not only of human nature and of life itself, but also of the forgotten, overlooked, untaught aspects of war and racial strife.Observe the polemics of those who call it racist. I dare say that that charge would be made by the same people of any book using any approbrious terminology whatever, regardless of the context.Also, as you read the negative reviews, notice the consistent lack of specifics of those who doubt its historical validity. There will not be one single example. This is part of their method of deterence, and they have nothing but hollow, unsupported invective. Anyone who needs clarification is welcome to email me.I am a constant reader, and I found Gone With the Wind not only sublime in its narrative and poetic in its dialogue, but an excellent adventure into the &quot;house of cards&quot; that was the lives of the Southern aristocracy.",
            "Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler are classic charecters along with the rest of them. They're as classic as the story. So much history is in the book. It gives a clear and good picture of how it was during that time. Everything isn't perfect. I'm 11 years old. That may seem too young to understand such a classic love story but I did. It was even better than other love stories like Wuthering Heights or Jane Eyre. Not to say they aren't classics. Ms. Mitchell writes the story clearly and comes straight to the point unlike for instance Henry James who takes up 2 pages to describe a woman's dress. If you read one love story in your life or watch one movie make it Gone with the Wind.",
            "As with all great classics, I am hard-pressed to say anything original about Gone With the Wind. This is my second reading and I still love the book. If you have seen the movie, but have not read the book, read the book. There is a great deal more that will only add to your enjoyment of the storyline.Some things I did not know about Margaret Mitchell made re-reading the book all the more interesting (thank you Wikipedia). Mitchell's maternal great-grandfather was from Ireland and settled on a slaveholding plantation in Georgia. Her grandfather fought in the Civil War and made a lot of money in the lumber business after the war (just like Scarlett!). As a young girl, Mitchell heard a lot of Civil War stories from her relatives and visited the ruined plantations in Georgia. And, most interesting to me was that her mother was a women's rights activist.I think these points are important because they give you a better understanding of the characters in GWTW. And I think the most interesting point is Mitchell's portrayal of Scarlett as a shrewd and independent businesswoman during a time when no women ran businesses or even played a role in commerce, except maybe in selling pies like Mrs. Merriwether and taking in sewing and boarders like Mrs. Elsing. (Or Belle Watling's business. Belle's character is also quite modern, profession aside.) Mitchell also portrays Ellen, Scarlett's mother, as the true head of the plantation, with Gerald as a figurehead.Although I love this book, it is difficult to read the sections about slavery and the slaves on the O'Hara plantation. The O'Haras take pride in their kind treatment of their slaves, yet the O'Haras and other plantation owners come off as very condescending. And who knows whether kind treatment was common on all southern plantations. It's a bad part of American history and all accounts of this time-period make you cringe. But I think it's important to note that some of Mitchell's slave characters (Mammy, Pork, Uncle Peter) are smarter and wiser than their owners.I think Mitchell's description of the post-war period is very good and it shows what a mess Atlanta was and how the Southern way of life known and loved by its people was forever lost. I like how the characters, particularly Melanie and her followers cling to their committees and old customs, even when the Northerners take over the city.There are certainly many, many other points to add about the characters and the book, Melanie's goodness, Ashley's displacement in the new South, and Scarlett's inability to understand and appreciate the people around her until it is too late.I like Rhett Butler the best. He is very modern, thinking it ridiculous never to mention pregnancy and birth control. He loves children and these things make him even more appealing. You want to forget how he makes his money, his drinking and what he does over at Belle's house because he is so likeable and smooth. His flirtatious conversations with Scarlett are so fun to read, but my favorite parts are when Rhett shows his true feelings to Melanie, and sadly to Scarlett at the end.",
            "Simply put, Gone With The Wind is a masterpiece of epic proportions. It doesn't get any better than this. The movie by comparison is an utter waste of time. I have read Gone With The Wind over and over again and it never gets old. I couldn't recommend a book more.",
            "I never saw the classic movie Gone With the Wind until I was in my late teens. But I had read the book. Of course I'd heard of the movie, and I had a vague idea that it was a romance tale set during the Civil War. But something drew me to it. Perhaps I picked up that it was an epic tale, or something similar.Anyway, one day while walking through a book store while in my early teens, I decided it was time I learned what all the fuss was about. Being a guy, I didn't expect to find much to like, but I figured I give the novel a chance.I'm glad I did.Yes, at its heart, Gone With the Wind is a romance story, though some might consider it a tragedy since (SPOILER ALERT) the romance dies in the end, but I loved the story.The characters were grand. The backdrop was ... well, it was epic, truth be told. The plotting was somewhat complex without being overly complicated. And it was pretty good writing.So why should I shun a novel just because it's romance? Because I'm a guy? That's silly.Especially considering, at least in my own opinion, this novel is so much more than just a romance. Believe me, as a form of education I've read a few romance novels. None of them come close to anything like Gone With the Wind.No bodice ripping here. There a scream or two from the heroine, but they're at appropriate times. And what a heroine! Scarlett O'hara is no wilting violet waiting for a man to save the day. No, she has no problems standing up for herself, maybe too much at times. In fact, Scarlett's hard-headedness is one of the character's tragic flaws within the novel.Okay, if you're one of those guy readers who thinks you could never pick up a romance novel, do yourself a favor and read Gone With the Wind. Though it's set in the American Civil War, you're not going to find page after page of descriptions of troop movements and battles and all that jazz. But you will find complex, interesting characters who are as real, as bold, and sometimes as weak as any found in the best literature of the world.",
            "This is the classic tale of wanting what you can't have ... until you can. Romance aside, this book is chock full of history, drama, suspense, emotional turmoil and philosophical whimsy. It's peppered with a dry, cynical wittiness that will keep you, not only turning pages, but smiling, laughing, and even occasionally gasping incredulously. Especially whenever the irresistible Rhett Butler enters a scene.The dialogue is simply smashing. The characters are realistic and resonate on a soul deep level. This is something that the movie version was, understandably, unable to pull off. Scarlett came across as a one dimensional, selfish, cold hearted monster on the big screen. In the book, however, we have behind the scenes access to her mind, heart, will and emotions. When this story is appreciated in literary form, one finds it difficult to either love or hate her entirely because, just as in reality, there are too many shades of gray.I have seen some people label this book as racist and intolerant. While I agree that there are some rather uncomfortable themes and an indisputable usage of inappropriate language, readers must bear in mind that this is a work of fiction depicting the culture and mind sets of characters living during the Civil War period. If the story had been written in any other way, it would have detracted from the authenticity of the tale. That being said, if you are sensitive to such things, you should probably steer clear.As far as I am concerned, this is a must read for any fan of historical fiction. Yet, I must warn you; Don't expect a happy or conclusive ending lest you be disappointed. After reading Forever Amber and many Anita Shreve books, I am always emotionally prepared for such a let down. Still, that didn't stop me from turning the last page of Gone With The Wind, anxiously looking for more. I was breathless with wonder, racked with unanswered questions, passionately angry at fate and, of course, torn between love and hate. When you really stop to think about it though, how could two personalities as dashingly quixotic as Scarlett and Rhett be expected to depart in any other fashion?",
            "I read GWTW one summer when I was a teenager, and got completely absorbed in it. I woke up one morning to the smell of bacon and stretched luxuriously in my bed as if I were Scarlett. Margaret Mitchell created a rich view of the antebellum south and characters that seemed real, making it easy for a reader to feel the horrors of the Civil War and empathize with the characters. Mitchell once said that Scarlett was a hussy, so I guess she was, but I never saw her that way. To me, she was a strong young woman who was forced out of her pampered world, determined to seize control of the future instead of cowering in a corner, even if it made her a social outcast.",
            "Margaret Mitchell wrote one of the most popular novels of all time. Set against the breath-taking backdrop of the red hills of Georgia during the American Civil War, Gone With the Wind is a window into a society that was swept away by war. Although I must say I doubt the portrayal of slavery is authentic in this work, every other aspect must be accurate. I have read some background information on Mitchell and, to my knowledge, she spent a significant amount of time researching every detail of her story--even down to the time of day that the list of deaths from the Battle of Gettysburg arrived in Atlanta.As a Southerner, I am proud of Mitchell's success and her novel. I would have to say that this is my favorite novel of all time--a great epic about the South and its storied past.However, as vast as the setting may be, it's easy to forget that there are two different plots going on: that of Georgia, and the South, during the Civil War, and that of Scarlett O'Hara and her struggle of hunger, poverty, love, and much more. The timing that Margaret Mitchell used in her novel (i.e. the death of Melanie, thus setting Ashley free; but at the same time realizing she, Scarlett, loved Rhett all along.) is amazing. However, the last part, Part V, moves a bit fast. But I suppose you can't dwell on 12 years worth of dialogue and narrative...I would recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys a historical novel. Although this book has been known since its publication as a romance, I would say that Gone With the Wind is anything but a modern romance--it is the epitome of what a romance SHOULD be.",
            "Gone With the Wind is one of those books that for years I've been telling myself I really should read, but other books just kept getting in the way. I finally decided pick it up, and couldn't put it down once I started it. It's such a wonderful story, and the ending is one of the best endings I've ever read in a book. The book is so much more than just a romance. I really wish Mitchell had written a sequel, because I would love to know what happens next to Scarlett (I know there are a few sequels out there by other authors, but to me that just isn't the same..I won't be reading them).One thing that was very hard for me to take was the extreme racism in the book. Of course, reading a book set in the South during slavery times and you know at least some of the characters will be racist. What surprised me though was how it is very apparent that Mitchell was very racist as well, and wasn't afraid to make her feelings about blacks and the South in general known. I really had to mentally block out some of Mitchell's attitudes in order to fully enjoy the book. At one point--around page 600, when Mitchell is describing the Restoration--I nearly had to set the book aside; it upset me so much. I'm glad I didn't though, because it is a great story, and one that will stay with me forever.",
            "The color red. It usually represents blood or love. However, Margaret Mitchell uses a little bit of both meanings in her description of Scarlett O'Hara, protagonist of Gone with the Wind. Scarlett represents two of the most powerful human emotions: love and hate. Gone with the Wind is truly classic American literature, as it encompasses such strong emotions and redefines the reader's historical understanding.It is hard to describe the level of feeling one gets from reading this book. Mitchell has loaded her story from cover to cover with strong details that take the reader on an intense voyage of human emotion. The reader can easily become involved in the story through this detail. The feelings Scarlett has for Ashley draw the reader back to his or her childhood. As Scarlett matures throughout the course of the novel, so too does the reader. Love, hate, anger and sorrow are all common emotions everyone experiences, and Mitchell uses her words to draw out these emotions from her readers so that they can truly understand Scarlett's character.They say that history is always written from the winner's perspective. This novel counters that, as it tells the story of the South from the South's perspective. For example, it provides a new point of view on Sherman's march to the sea, showing the way the Southern cities were affected and the feelings of the people living in them. Because the events are familiar to the reader, they stick out and maintain the reader's interest.Gone with the Wind is a classic in American literature, and is a touching story of a young woman experiencing life. Her name reflects her various personality traits, and makes for an interesting story. Everyone should read this book, but make sure you have plenty of time, as it is quite a lengthy book. Also, while extremely touching and a fun read, it can be difficult at times due to the broken Southern used as dialogue. Despite these few drawbacks, the novel is highly recommended to anyone who enjoys curling up with a good book and becoming emotionally part of the story. It is a good story that reflects the many aspects found in the color red.",
            "I am 16 years old and finished Gone With The Wind a few months ago. This is the most amazing story I have ever had the pleasure to lay my eyes upon. I have had an obsession with Gone With The Wind for quite some time and I read anything and everything I can about this novel and the film, my all time favorite movie. This is an amazingly captivating novel. Margaret Mitchell is perhaps the greatest author in American history. She is a literary goddess and her timeless characters have left a huge impression upon me. People say that the greatest tragedy in literary history is Romeo and Juliet...I think not! When I finished reading Gone With The Wind I realized that those people were wrong...when Rhett leaves Scarlett after all of her pleading and apologizing...it is undescribable in human terminology. Mitchell's amazing recount of the Civil War, the Old South, and the lives that were touched by both is unparalleled in the history of recorded language...I have become ! extremely interested in the history of the Old South and the greatest American crisis-the Civil War. This novel is by far a literary phenomenon...it will never be equalled or surpassed! I feel priveleged to have been able to read this book and I thank Ms. Mitchell for writing this paramount spectacle.",
            "&quot; Un-put-a-downable.&quot; When I started reading this book, I completely lost track of time. I became so hooked on the romance between Scarlett and Rhett, I just thought about it for days and days. I convinced my friends to read it, and they were addicted to it also. The film Gone with the Wind is superb, I imagine Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable perfectly as the two! The descriptions and wit in the novel is unsurpassed, by the end of the novel I felt like I knew Scarlett &quot; down the her bones&quot;. Very few books made me laugh aloud, gasp, sigh, and cry--this is one of them. Every time I pass the book on my shelf. I want to read it again. Once you get started..it's hell to stop. The sequel is pretty good, I just needed more of Rhett and Scarlett to keep thinking of. I wish terribly that Margaret Mitchell had written more for us to eternally cherish. Bless that woman!",
            "Visit a time when women were &quot;hoop-skirted&quot; ladies and men treated them with charming, exaggerated kindness and respect. Take a ride in a horse carriage to a ball, and there be introduced to some of the most memorable people you'll ever meet. I'm refering to the exciting experience of Gone With The Wind. Nothing you ever read will captivate, motivate, affect, or teach you more. The characters are so real that they become part of your life, they change your life. Scarlett O'hara is the most beautiful, unforgettable heroine of any novel. Spoiled and self-centered, but there's still no denying that she's a very intelligent, strong person. You get to know Scarlett so well that she becomes part of you, and she even changes how you view yourself and your life. You fall in love with dashing, dark, handsome, mysterious, yet, charming Mr. Rhett Butler. Not to exclude the other wonderful personalities of Ashley Wilkes, sweet Melanie, Aunt Pitty Pat, and certainly not excluding Mammy. Witness the horror of the Civil War, and learn the truth about the Old South. While also learnig about love, life, and the exciting unpredictablities of both. I love, adore, and cherish GWTW! If you've read I'm certain you fell the same. If you haven't read GWTW I could cry for you! You are missing out on the chance of a lifetime, truly! You simply must read it!",
            "\"Burdens are for shoulders strong enough to carry them\"Tara Plantation, near Jonesborough, near Atlanta, GeorgiaKatie \"Scarlett\" O'Hara is the most charming Southern belle, gathering the attention of beaux all over the surrounding areas. But when she learns the man she had been psuedo-courting, Ashley Wilkes, is marrying Melanie Hamilton from Atlanta, his cousin, she schemes to win him back. When he refuses, she immediately marries Charles Hamilton in spite. But Civil War has come to the South, and Scarlett quickly finds herself a widow, stuck in Atlanta, with a child, unable to be the pretty belle she had been a few months prior. Will Scarlett ever get Ashley? What about the strange Rhett Butler character, who is constantly tweaking her? Will Scarlett and her family survive the war?Let me preface my review with this: I don't read a lot of historical fiction or chick lit or romance or anything. My speciality is science fiction, fantasy, and urban fantasy. However, this book absolutely, positively blew me away!At first, I found the novel a bit slow. There were so many characters, and at first, it seemed like nothing happened. But that wasn't to last. Quickly, I became interested in Scarlett's schemes to snatch Ashley away from Melanie, all the while hating her for her bad behavior. By the end of the book, there were points were I was in near tears.Scarlett wasn't my favorite character. She was a rude, bitter, selfish woman. But I completely understood her predicament. To the reader, she was completely honest, despising her first husband's death (and life!), her dislike of children (don't see that much in romance do we!), her dislike of women's poor station (always having to act \"silly\" in front of the menfolk), and taking the reigns of business to make a life of her own. So while I didn't like her, I also didn't hate her. I understood what she was trying to do and found myself rooting for her against the odds. She is a brilliantly written character, so dynamic, multifaceted and full.Melanie Hamilton was probably my favorite character. This might seem odd as she does come off as a Mary Sue--perfect and sweet to everyone, always right, yada, yada--and I hate Mary Sues. But I really never found Melanie a Mary Sue. Scarlett repeatedly downplays Melanie's beauty. Melanie is strong-willed and works diligently, but tires easily (such as when she works at Tara in the cotton fields). Like Scarlett, Melanie was definitely not a 1-D character. She appeared weak on the outside, while maintaining strenght in the face of danger, in the face of childbirth, in the face of hard times. She was a true inspiration to me.Rhett Butler made me so furious, sometimes I wanted to slap him like Scarlett! But other times, he was so charming and debonair, that I wanted to melt in his arms like butter. I loved how forthright he was, how practical and realistic he was, and yet how at times, his passionate nature came through (joining the Confederate army at the end, for example).Side characters, such as Miss Pittypat, Mammy, Dilcey, Pork, Uncle Peter, Mrs. Meade, Belle Watling, and more, jumped out at me. They felt like real people, people influenced by dreams, desires, and feelings. Probably one of the sweetest moments was when Dr. and Mrs. Meade were talking and she mentioned she would rather him be at Belle's than dead. Given what Mrs. Meade had been through, what she held dear, it was particularly poignant.I could go on endlessly about the amazing life lessons and themes and symbols in the book. Quotes about the status of women at the time, about changing with the changing times, about strength of character, about being who you are, and about what is really important in life abound in this book. Most of the ones that really touched me may be found on my profile page, though the whole book is brimming with it.As this deals with the South during the Civil War, there is much talk of slavery; one of the reasons, I believe, it has been so frequently placed on the Banned Books list. Some people believe that it shows slavery in a favorable light, that blacks were/are children that need to be tended by whites. My opinion is this: it shows how many white Southern plantation owners viewed slaves. Not all slave owners were Mr. Simon Legree of Uncle Tom's Cabin. Conversely, not all slave owners are like the O'Hara's. Yes, there are a lot of black stereotypes (Mammy, Prissy, etc.), but this is a snapshot into the past. You can't take this book and try to force modern views of civil rights and racism into it. However, I do believe it makes a brilliant discussion piece: comparing Scarlett and other Southern whites' views of blacks with other accounts (such as Uncle Tom's Cabin or the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn).All in all, this is a brilliant book, made more excellent by the narrator, who deftly interprets the Southern dialect and accents for the listener. I thoroughly enjoyed it and was heart-broken, but inspired, when it ended. I highly recommend, even to those, like me, who aren't big into historical fiction.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*",
            "This book was virtually transferring me back into time like a time machine..you live the book, you feel the book, you \"see\" the book..you are there..with Scarlett, Rhett, Mammy, Melanie, and Ashley..unbelievably emotional at all extremes..I love it and will be glad to re-read it.",
            "When I first picked up Gone with the Wind, it seemed impossibly large. However, halfway through the second page, I began noticing that the words were flying by, and my world was slowly grinding to a halt. Everything stopped so I could continue reading. The book was absolutely enthralling. The chemistry and romance between Rhett and Scarlett was so incredibly well written that I could see sparks flying out of their eyes, and here the firecrackers crackling as they traded insults. Even if they didnt know that they were perfect for eachother, we knew. After reading this book, I have come to the conclusion that, not only is Margaret Mitchell a phenomenal American writer, but she also is one of the best people to describe the South during and around the Civil War time period. She completely deserved the Pultizer Prize that she won, and I will continue to pass on the message about this amazing book. Such an archetypal novel should be timeless; it will never die out or become obsolete.",
            "well, ok, the cover looks like a romance novel and i wouldnt be caught dead without some kind of a dust jacket.it was very engaging and a fast read though its size can be daunting. with colorful discreptions, wonderful prose and excllient character development it is well worth the time it takes to finish it. it's one of the few books i would say is much better than the movie. you'll be glad you read it.",
            "Originally, I fell in love with the movie. The book is the same characters but weaves a deeper story rich in language, history and description. Mitchell's love of Atlanta and knowledge of the South makes this novel so inviting. Don't let the length be offsetting this book reads itself it flows so smoothly.",
            "I would give this 10 stars if I could. I haven't read this since I was a young girl in the early 70's and should never have waited so long to read it again. The characters were exceptionally well drawn, the dialogue was brilliant, particularly between Rhett (SIGH!) and Scarlett. I swear there was sparks flying off the pages. I am going to miss the people I will have to put behind me now that the book has come to an end, Rhett (SIGH), Scarlett, Mammy, Prissy and Aunt Pitty Pat (LOL).The author's use of prose was beautiful, all the scenes and action came alive for me. Some people seem to be offended by the racism in the book, but that's how things were back then. Sugar coating it would have ruined the story reducing it to a Harlequin romance.This is an incredibly well written book about the death of a civilization and the struggles to survive in the new era. This is a book that should not be missed, particulary those who enjoy historical fiction.",
            "I actually discorved Gone with the Wind when I was eleven, and it is an interesting story. I was in a race against a classmate to find the longest book in the school library, read it, and pass the test on it before she did. I read it, wondered why they put a book like that in an elementary school, took the test, passed and basked in the glory or beating someone. But when it was time to return my copy to the library I was disappointed, and renewed it three times until the librarian made me give it back. Then, months later I was visiting my grandmother (she lived in Texas, I in Nebraska) and noticed that she had a copy of the book (with a sticker on the front that said 50 cents.). I took it out of the shelf and started to read it, and when my grandma found me reading it, she said she never liked it and gave it to me. Bam. Love at first page. I read it three times and got the sequel from the public library (not bad, but it will never compare to the original), and saw both the GWTW movie and the 'Scarlett' miniseries, before I was twelve.I am always reading Gone with the Wind. My old copy is hidden away somewhere, but I bought myself a new one in slightly better condition. I am in ove with this book. I read it late at night every singe night, and when I finish the book I instantly start again. I have yet to find any book by any author that could possibly stand up to this novel. To anyone to is considering this book but can't decide-buy this book. The money you pay for this piece of writing will be the most well-spent money you've ever given for a book. This is an unforgettable tale with two of the greatest characters of all time. Need I say more?",
            "GWTW is passion, betrayals, and the flirtations of southern breezes on sultry nights. Mitchell gets into the characters' heads better than most authors dare dream to do.",
            "The most fantastic lovestory ever written and possibly the best book. This is my favourite book certainly and the sequel isn't a patch on it. Definitely should be recommended for everyone!",

THIS PULLED ME IN AS SOON AS I BEGAN READING IT AND I RECOMMEND IT FOR ANYONE WHO LIKES THE BEST OF BOOKS. IT IS A TRUE CLASSIC AND TRULY SHOWS HOW THE SOUTH SUFFERED IN THE CIVIL WAR AND THE REBUILDING OF THE SOUTH. I LOVED GONE WITH THE WIND.",
            "I think this is the best book I've ever read! You should really read this book. I love it! and I'll read it again!",
            "This book is about a love story which takes place in the Civil War period and it gives you a magnificent disription of what the south went through during the American Civil War. (The movie is just as good , in my oppnion)",
            "&quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is certainly the most wonderful book I have ever read. Never has a book made me acutally feel as if I was there watching it happen. I recommend this book to ANYONE, and EVERYONE!!",
            "I'm in the third grade and this was a really good book",
            "I have read this book at least 10 times. I am never bored or figedty when I'm reading GWTW. I love the movie too. I have made my family watch it so many times that my 18year old daughter is now a GWTW fan, too!",
            "Thsi is my absolute favorite book, I have read it at least 20 times! The first time in 2 days. The length is not important when you finish it you'll be wishing for another 2000 pages!",
            "The book takes some getting into, it doesn't really get interesting until the 200th page, but it's worht it! I would read it again and again. I'm only 14, and I loved this book!",
            "Gone With the Wind is an amazing novel, I would recommend it to anyone. I read it when i was 14 and it was a considerably easy read, everyone should read it. It is AMAZING!!!",
            "I know some people are a little bit aprehensive when they are thinking about reading a classic, and rightly so, but although it is long and wordy (some parts can be very confusing and maybe read over a few times) it is one of the greatest romance stories ever written. I loved this book so much and have read it over and over again, and each time I discover little things that I've missed before. Definitely worth the amount of time it takes to read, also, try reading the sequel, Scarlett. I can't remember the author, but the style of Margaret Mitchell was immitated very well.",
            "Gone With the Wind is one of the most wonderful books I have ever read. It's a beautiful story of the civil war told from a southern belle's point of view. I had serious migranes reading it, since the print is so tiny but it was well worth it! I first read this at 13 and I would reccomend it to anybody!",
            "I loved this book. It gave a very interesting viewpoint of the south during the civil war. Everyone should read it instead of watching the movie!",
            "Okay, I saw the movie and it was awesome. But it's nothing compared to this fast paced, brilliantly written book. I've read it twice in the past three months and each time it's been amazing. I would deffinatly reccomend this to absolutely everyone.",
            "Reading I have started since kindergraten, and never have I read better. Gond with the Wind is a book of history and it is timless.",
            "The title says it all. Poor Scarlett. In her life, everything is just Gone with the Wind. Rhett. Her lifestyle. Melanie. The Confederacy. Her mother, Ellen. Her father, Gerald. Her first husband, Charles. Her second husband, Frank. Bonnie. The Tarleton twins. Cade. But through it all, she goes on. My favorite character was Melanie Hamilton Wilkes. She was so nice, loyal, trustworthy, loving, brave, courageous, funny, charming, polite, and Oh! so much more...My least favorite character was Rhett. \"That nasty varmint!\" as Scarlett said. I hated how Scarlett was so mean to Melanie, until it was too late. But no matter what scarlett did or said that was wrong, Melanie still loved her and stuck by her until the end, and even past then! I am also delighted that this story is told by the Confederate point if view. Atta girl, Mithcell!! A must for all Confederates, adults, children, everyone should read it!!!!!!!!",
            "I am only a teenager, but I have read this book cover to cover at least 5 times. It is absolutely amazing. It takes a very good book to make me cry, but by the end of Gone With the Wind, I'm bawling my eyes out. I'm in a bad mood for days every time I read it because of the ending. It makes me so frusterated. I never thought a book could do that. As soon as I found out there was a sequel, I went to the library and read it. It may not be as good as Gone With the Wind (but then, what is?) but it gives a plausible answer to this phenomenal saga of the south.",
            "After seeing the movie, I just had to read the novel. Although parts vary from what they are in the movie, it doesn't at all take away from the magic in Margaret Mitchell's words. I see Scarlett as someone I would want to be be. A woman who's strong, beautiful, and vain... and gets away with it. Rhett Butler is the epitimy of what a man should be. He's romantic and keeps you wondering what he's going to do next. All of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler's trials and happy moments are what makes Gone With the Wind the classic that it is. Mitchell's way of describing the brave (but horrible) downfall of the South is extrodinary. Anyone who loves romance, wit, and adventure should definitely read Gone With the Wind!",
            "This Book was elegeantly written.Itwas also throughly researched. Giving vivid details and a compelling love story. This is always going to be a american icon. if you were questioning whether or not to read the book read it and you will be undoubtfully satisfied",

            "I personally very much enjoyed \"Gone With the Wind\". It was filled with romance as well as peril and unpredictability. I recomend this book for young adults and adults because it is not a kid theme.",
            "I read this book once. Once was enough, but twice would be better. I'm an avid reader, and writer. This book captured every emotion that literary devices are suppose to capture. I found myself crying, laughing, scared, shocked. I've been searching for a book that competes with Gone With the Wind and haven't found one. You know the main characters like they are in your life, and you're taken back to the Civil War. Nothing is downcasted, everything is how it was in the eighteen sixies. Scarlett O'Hara was such a wonderful character, she lives in everyone hearts long after the last page is turned. Even though the book is lengthy, it keeps your attention, truely, until the last page and would keep it further if it were longer. The book was amazing, a true American Literature Classic. I highly recommend this book. You won't be able to find another like it. Gone With the Wind is a true, diamon in the rough.",
            "and hope she loves as much as I do.I have read this story several times- so many that I have it commited to memory!I always had a copy of it with me until my last one feel apart from reading it to many times.!Scarlett is a strong woman, and in that time that strength was frowned upon by both men and women. I have - many times, drawn on the strength that she had through out the story.I hope that my daughter reads this when she is a teen and sees Scarlett for the modern woman that she is.",
            "Gone With the Wind is a beatifully written book that intrigued me from the very beginning! I had to read this book for an English class. My mom suggested it to me and I decided to make her happy I would start it, but I knew I'd never finish it- I mean 1,000 pages???? But, the first time I picked it up I read until page 70 and I would have kept reading, but it was late! It made me laugh, cry, and everything in between. I love how the book ends how it ends.(I can't tell you how!)I did read the sequel, and I have to say, it was OK, but not nearly as well written as Gone With the Wind. I would recommend this book to anyone who is in need of a good novel. Don't let the 1,000 pages intimidate you because when you read it, you'll forget there are that many pages, honest!!!!!",
            "Margaret Mitchell captures the essence of the Old South and skillfully interweaves that history with the travail of the civil war. She illustrates the high purposes for which the South fought the war and also demonstrates the utter futility of the Southern position and the senseless nature of most conflicts.",
            "IT IS ONE OF THE MOST UNFORGETTABLE STORY I HAVE EVER READ . IT IS ONE STORY THAT IS HARD TO RESIST AND STOP READING . WHO CAN EVER EVER FORGET THE FIERY CHARACTER OF SCARLETT O'HARA AND THE COOL , DASHING SOLDIER OF FORTUNE , RHETT BUTLER AND THEIR UNUSUAL DEVELOPMENT OF LOVE ?",
            "Before I picked up this book, I read most of the reviews, but I knew better than to let the opinions of others influence me tremendously. And so, I read through 1000 pages of war, Southern society/conventions in the antebellum and reconstruction South, and of course, the tempestuous romance between Scarlett and Rhett.I was expecting a romance, but I cannot classify GWTW as romance, but rather as historical fiction. Margaret Mitchell writes with a voice that captivates, evokes emotion, but most of all, she brings the Civil War and its aftermath to life especially through Scarlett O'Hara. The destitution, plights, burdens, and silly notions/convictions of Scarlett's reflect the people of the time; it gives readers a glimpse of failure, poverty, and the desperation war leaves in its trail. This is why I enjoyed this novel-the sentiments, struggles, and even the uncharitable thoughts going through Scarlett's head allowed me to feel empathy and to relate. The ignorance, grief, desperation, painful repercussions, and hope that circulate throughout novel are artfully portrayed.As to the romance, it wasn't what I was hoping for, but it was realistic. Honestly, I didn't like a single character in the novel because none of them knew the true meaning of love, and if they did, they didn't know how to express it. Scarlett is comparable to a spoiled, pampered child who lives eternally in her bubble even after all her hardships; she sees but does not grasp and doesn't have the will to do so. However, her strength and courage are to be commmended because despite her beliefs, she does not fail herself or others when it truly matters. Rhett is a complete idiot and their disastrous marriage is partly his fault because he never fought for his love...just like his blase skeptical outlook on people and life, he let it all slide by because what he hoped for didn't turn out to be reality. He used the wrong approach and so the ends did not meet as it should have, and how he hurt in the process. Mellanie was just too nice and naive to really be human; I find it almost unbelievable at times to see how much faith she had in everyone. Just as Scarlett's selfish, ill-conceived thoughts never ceased to amaze me, Mellanie's belief in man's better nature was as tedious. She is however the most likeable character. Ashley is weak, pitiful and as Scarlett realizes, the type of man girls dream about, but not worthy of their idolatry because the disillusionment is not worth it. Despite having a hard time liking any of the selfish or selfless and infinitely unworthy characters, I must admit that the characterization was dynamic. I really wanted to slap Scarlett, Mellanie, Rhett, and Ashley at some point or other. And at the same time, my heart went out to them because I could understand why they did the things they did.GWTW is an entertaining read, unique to its kind (just like The Fountainhead), but I didn't find it magnificent or glorious. The novel is as bitter as it is uplifting and I couldn't find a balance between the two. Just a lot of tolerance for silly, selfish, careless creatures and pity for those who reach the \"aha\" moment when it is too late. Because it's so well-written though, I know for sure that it is not a novel I am going to forget (which is often the case) and I am very glad I forced myself to read it. It was definitely an experience.",
            "This book was published in 1936; in the ensuing seventy years, no one has even come close to topping it. Enough said.",
            "This book is definitely worth the read. Although long, Gone with the Wind by Margaret Mitchell has a lot going on in it. Mitchell develops the characters so well that you can almost see them. It is also great for history. This is because I always learned about the civil war through the northerners eyes. In this book you see it all through the eyes of a southerner. As the story progresses you build up more and more grudges against Scarlet, who is not your best friend. Scarlet is rude and takes on too \"manly\" duties. Close to the end, though, she finally gets kicked back. When hard times hit she becomes more sweet, gentle and womanly. However, that does not last long enough. When her marital status changes she regains money and again, she gives up her sweetness and goes back to her old self. This book would be good for those who enjoy romantic, historical and classic novels about the civil war. Stick with it through the slow parts and you can easily enjoy the rest. If you have not read this yet, buy in now, it will not be like any other book you've ever read.",

            "This book will make a beautiful gift! It is still nice to have a book in your hands and it'll be very inviting sitting on the shelf",
            "There are a few main factors that fed into how I reviewed the book:1. Scarlett is annoying, not that bright, pretty cruel, and not my idea of a great lady. She doesn't really change for the better and her violent reactions become predictable.2. The story is woven very nicely, though it is extremely verbose at times.3. Mitchell created vivid, interesting characters who were fun to observe (with the exception of Scarlett, at times).4. People rant and rave over it being a racist novel, which is, in a sense, true. It is a book written about a racist group of people during a racist period of history in an area that was known to be very racist at the time. It was interesting to see how unapologetically racist people could be, according to Mitchell's storytelling at least. The book, though, is not racist in the sense that it supports racism and bigotry. In fact, I walked away from this book with a heightened interest in learning more about what freed slaves endured during the years following the war. For me, the mark of a good book is whether it encourages further study and intellectual curiosity, which Gone With the WInd can do.",
            "I purchased this book for a gift. The cover and the text were good, but the side of the book had a huge black marker line right down the bottom. I don't mind so much for myself, but I do not feel good about giving a gift that is marred. I was very unhappy.",

            "and the 1000p+ pages just flew by effortlessly...like listening to good music, reading he prose requires no effort.My only gripe is that the principle protagonists, Scarlet and Rhett, are not very likeable...to put it mildly.Scarlet is a flat out sociopath, and Rhett is little more than a common criminal.I had hoped that over 1000+ pages they might grow and develop...but despite lots of travails and trials, they do not...which was rather disappointing.",
            "The price could not be beat! It is a long book and I hadn't read it for 40 years. I love the story and wanted to re-read it. Thank you for the fantastic read at a fantastic price.",

            "This book is a definite YES! It's exciting and it keeps you on the egde of your seat. It's so hard to put down! Scarlett and Rhett are such believeable characters and this is definitely the BEST book ever written. I strongly suggest you purchase it or check it out. This is a super book. It gives an exellent portrayal of the south before and after the war. It gives you the south's point of view. I would give it 10000000000000000000 stars!",
            "I absolutly loved GWTW! I loved the way Rhett acted towards Scarlett. In the beginning the way Mrs. Mitchell describes Scarlett is very good and gives you a good idea of the way Scarlett is. Rhett was my favorite character because he was so dashing and handsome. He also was kind and sweet you just couldn't tell most of the time, He was so funny when he was with Scarlett and how he hid his love for her made me sad. Scarlett was really a mean person most of the time, she was selfish and creul to the people around her. It made me mad the way she thought about Melanie, and how she used men to get money or revenge. Ashley was one of my least favorite characters, he was so unrealistic! The Tarleton twins were some of my favorites, they were vivacious and funny and sweet to Scarlett in the time you read about them. I just don't understand how Scarlett could just give up everything she had grown up in to be rich. Its just not right. I loved the part of the story during Rhett's and Scarlett's honeymoon! They were so happy! Bonnie was so like Scarlett it was unbelievable. You could understand why all the people and Rhett and even Scarlett loved her so! But how could she just send Wade and Ella away to Tara that way without any feeling about it. You could totally relate to the characters in the story, it on numerous times made me laugh, cry, mad, and jump for joy! I loved it!",
            "The minute I began this book, it was my all-time favorite. I had just turned eleven when I read it, and a lot of people thought it would be way over my head, but it wasn't. I read it in five days, that's about 205 pages a day. The instant I began reading it, Margaret Mitchell was my favorite author and GWTW was my favorite book. It is totally unsurpassed. It is and will remain a classic forever. Scarlett &amp; Rhett were very realistic, as were the other characters. I've read it several times. Every time I read it, I cry at the end, and at other various places in the book. There are no words that could ever possibly describe how spectacular, wonderful, magnificent, this book is. It is totallu unforgettable. If you read this book and didn't like it, there's something the matter with you, because it's totally lovable. It's impossible not to like it. I couldn't put it down the entire time I was reading. I took it everywhere with me. When I was done, I searched everywhere for the sequel, SCARLETT. I had to wait almost a week before it came in and I was dying to know what happened the entire time. I couldn't sleep some nights, for worrying about how things would turn out. I've been trying to get all my friends to read this great book. Some of them are actually thinking about it. There is just nothing else to say about a book as great as this one.",
            "Perhaps it was Scarlett's unbreakable spirit as she tries to overcome her physical and mental struggles. Maybe it is the unreadabe and constantly fickle Rhett Butler. Or possibly it is the way the author describes the characters, the settings, and the events of this gripping novel in her own unique way. I really cannot specifically pinpoint why &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is my favorite book. All I know is that somehow it captivated me, and even now, a year after I first read it, I am still constantly thinking about it. The hard simplicity and honesty of the novel make it easy to love, and I imagine I will always cherish it.",
            "a long time ago, i had heard about gone with the wind, a lot of my friends parents would tell me about it, and i never, ever, thought that i would actually enjoy reading this 1000 paged book. i was very much mistaken. margaret mitchell really could write a story. at work one day, there was an old copy on our shelf, i decided to pick it up and just for the heck of it, give it a chance. well, lets just say, i could not put it down. it was by far the most captivating, best story ever written. after you are done reading it, it remains in your heart forever. scarlett is our present day ally mcbeal, looking for love in all the wrong places, confused, not having a clue what she really wants out of a relationship. rhett, he is the most sexiest character ever written, no present day harlequin romance even comes close. but if you want to know more, you must read the book, believe me you will not be disappointed.",
            "I noticed some other people who wrote reviews complaining about how racist the book is. I hope it will help show how it happened that there was a terribly bloody war fought and that slaveholders were less monstrous than I used to think. I loved the book. The sequel was less good, but everyone should still read it",
            "There are many reviews for the edition of this classic novel stating that page 713 is missing and in it's place is 813.I ordered this edition because I loved the cover. That may sound materialistic, but I really didn't care that one page was wronged, as I am used to reading books that have pages missing (Our library is in need lol)I recieved my copy yesterday, and immediately turned to see this notorius mistake. I am happy to report that the problem has been fixed, and that page 713 is now there!THis is a wonderful edition. The cover is beautiful, the pages neatly layed out, and a quite enjoyable book at that.Wonderful wonderful wonderful. Strongly recommend it!!",
            "I was feverently reading a key scene between Rhett and Scarlett last night and when I got to page 713 - there WAS not 713. It was page 813!! Uggh! What a bummer. Great story, one of the best I've ever read, but that missing page really breaks up the flow. Buy a different version!",
            "GWTW is a classic, undoubtedly - sweeping, romantic, colorful, well written, all of that. I have read it so many times and seen the movie enough to recite it word for word, loved swashbuckling Captain Butler and plucky, selfish Scarlett for all that she is, a woman of her own worth during times when women were showpieces more than anything else. And i absolutely love the descriptions of the civil war background - it is sweeping, historically accurate and touching, many times. I can slip the movie in at any scene or pick up the book and spend a few hours undisturbed just lost in its language and flow.All of that said, i think it is important not to forget that Mitchell has not mentioned one word against slavery in the 800+ pages she penned, slavery being the burning, heart rending issue of the time the novel was set. Every country and state goes through change, for good or bad and we lose times that were precious, sentimental, valuable - or we lose a 'land of grace and plenty' as she calls pre war Georgia. But we also gain causes that are worth it in terms of human reslience and courage and value/respect for others. Looking at it that way the novel comes across like a victorian painting - pretty and appealing but lacking in soul.",
            "People read the book and leave all the politics aside if you're going to read this book. Enjoy it and remember this book was written in the 1930's. Very different way of thinking back then. I have read some of the reviews and I just threw my hands in the air and decided to write my review. That is how mad I got. Why? Well, everytime someone decides to write a review about a book that took place during the civil war someone has to put in there two cents, about how horrible the whites treated the slaves or how horrible slavery was. Please. Okay, yes slavery did happen. And I don't conden it niether. But everyday one can not escape not listening to it about the subject on t.v.(especially the Oprah show, I really think that lady spends her life talking about the subject, bitter woman, or movies, or songs, ect. ect. ect. From all I have read and seen and learned does one really believe all the plantation owners beat there slaves and killed them? I mean would a plantation owner who paid top dollar for a slave just take him home and starve him, beat him, and have chained him and just treat him worse than a dog. I don't think so. It just not possible that all plantation owners did that. If that really was widespread as we are lead to believe then now, then there would have been an uprising of slaves sooner then Civil War. There would not have been any need for a Civil War if all the whites of the South then were the cruel vicious monster we have been lead to believe they were. As allways when we have a small majorit of people to tell us history (that is t.v., roots, and all them bad history channels, and magazines and supposely non-fiction books that are written with the liberal mentality), they just re-write history. If one really wants to find out the history of the south. READ OLD BOOKS ON HISTORY!!! NOT THE NEW ONES!!! OLD BOOKS!!! WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT HISTORY IT HAS ALL BEEN RE-WRITTEN!!! Whew! I feel better now.Oh by the way. This is from a Hispanic telling you this.So if you really want to enjoy this book. Enjoy reading Scarlett scandals and her fight to never be hungry again. Enjoy her trying ever art she knows to take that poor excuse of a man Ashley away from the every loyal Melanie. Enjoy Scarlett when she tries to figure out Rhett and why she just cannot get it through her thick bull-headed head that she always has been in love him.",
            "My paper back is barely going to withstand another reading since I have nearly worn it out. I actually read the book before seeing the movie. I was very disappointed! The movie made Scarlett seem so evil, but in the book she depicted more as a strong woman who did what she had to do to survive. The only thing that would be better than reading this book again, would be to have the audio version so I could listen to it in the car.",
            "I think that Gone with the wind is the best book ever written the movie is a winner to . I love how it informs you of everything that is going on. You go through the whole book like will Scarlett and Redett get together or will they stay together will Scarlett finally get Ashely. Will they survive the war. Who will live and who will die. You read through the tragides and the good times . I give Gone with the Wind and will argue with anyone who differs.",
            "this novel is coming from others generations for me, at first my mother read it and loved it so now i became interested in reading to, i hope it`s cool because i will spend a long time reading and end up bored will be terible.",
            "This edition is literally missing the part where Bonnie dies! There are no pages missing, just the material. Horrific. I threw it out.",
            "First, let me say that Gone With the Wind is possibly the best and most satisfyingly well-written novel I have ever read. To quote Alice Randall, the author of another favorite of mine, The Wind Done Gone, &quot;Above all, Gone With the Wind made me think.&quot;Anyone who gives this book less than three stars invariably does so because of the rampant racism throughout the novel. One cannot say in defense that it was simply the views of the people at the time, because Magaret Mitchell, the author, was not just being historically accurate; she was racist herself.The horror! A racist novel by a racist author! And what's worse, it's one of the best loved novels in America.Parts of this book did make me cringe and leave me angry, namely the roles of Prissy and Big Sam. Yes, those parts were atrocious. But here's a thought:Pretend for a minute that you were born in the early 1900's, in the deep South, with Confederate veterans and aging Southern belles for family. Now tell me you wouldn't be racist. Of course, any middle class enlightened white person would say they'd know better, but would you? I greatly doubt it. Gone With the Wind is fiction, not fact, from the mind of a woman who embodied what her family taught her, no more. Take it and move on. Sure, it's offensive, but it's also wonderful. There are too many layers to this novel for the complexity of it to be fully appreciated in my review, but if you're can't get past the racism to appreciate this book, then I have to wonder what else you're missing in life.What I did when I finished Gone With the Wind was go out and buy Alice Randall's book The Wind Done Gone. It's very thought provoking, and it will mollify a bit of your anger dealing with the bad treatment of blacks in this book. Also, I reccomend The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison, because it deals with the internalized racism that slaves felt in the pre-war South. Beloved is another great one that will show you what the slaves REALLY went through. But don't miss out on Gone With the Wind. Read it, love it, and let it show you the past.",
            "I haven't really heard anything about this book nor have I seen the movie, so I didn't know what to expect when I started reading. I suppose I could use my desire to to broaden my reading scope as a reason for picking up this novel. I haven't read enough of the classics, the heavy stuff, the stuff that should have a good reason for staying around this long.Anyway, this book was teeming with racist undertones, and it annoyed me, to say the least. I could never really get comfortable with the writing, however beautiful and applause-worthy it was, because in would come the worthless diatribes about the slaves and how dumb and shiftless and worthless they were. It's not that the book was written about times of slavery and the aftermath of the American Civil War; I understand that people in those times had their reasons and their own beliefs. (I read Queen by Alex Haley with no problem, although I will concede that Queen was written by descendant of slaves and the view would be slightly different.) But I wonder if the woman who wrote Gone With the Wind was racist--or at the very least more than mildly prejudiced--because she wrote unnecessary addendums when describing the 'darkies,' superfluous ramblings that seemed to be more her own thoughts than the thoughts of the book's characters. She wrote things like, [the slave girl] couldn't comprehend...in her little black skull, and the use of the 'n' word when something else would have sufficed. The way she described Big Sam's excitement in seeing his mistress again after the war almost made my blood run cold. I ran into a lot about how the 'good' slaves all hated the idea of being free and the 'no good free issue' slaves were the ones who, apparently, realized that they were getting a raw deal when it came to that 'peculiar institution.' Really, wanting to be equal to whites [in every way that counted] was such a preposterous idea! I get the feeling I'm overreacting, but that's what happens when you read material like that in times such as these.Another thing that bothered me about it is that this is supposed to be the greatest love story of all time and almost eight hundred pages into the thing, Rhett and Scarlett still weren't together. He loved her--he admitted this to her at least thrice--and she didn't realize that she even really liked him, let alone loved him, until she halfway got over her Ashley Wilkes obsession.My third problem with the book came in the form of one young Miss O'Hara. As much as I tried to remain sympathetic and understanding to Scarlett's plight and her reasonings, her behavior made it easy for me to remain unmoved while reading. While I applauded her moments of unselfishness (very few and far between), Katie Scarlett O'Hara Hamilton Kennedy Butler was a nuisance and she was one of the main reasons I walked away from this book without too much feeling. However, I did love the way Rhett was written, for reasons I cannot properly articulate because even I do not know why I liked him so much. I guess I believe he and Melanie Hamilton Wilkes were the only truly likeable people in this book.The language was beautiful, the scenes vivid, breathtaking and all of that which is desirable when talking books. Ms. Mitchell wrote a really good book but sadly, it's not for everyone to enjoy.",
            "A real classic that I read first in 1963, and have read many times since. Just buying a copy for Kindle.",
            "Margaret Mitchell's Scarlett was a strong woman who could just as easily lived in the 1960s as she did the 1860s. What a strong, admirable role model she must have been for girls when this book first came out in the thirties. All those pages and yet, I couldn't put the thing down.",
            "Mitchell combined love and war the way no other writer could have done it. The romance between Scarlett and Rhett left readers clinging to every word spoken between the two. In the midst of their world falling apart, Phett still had a passion for Scarlett, and Scarlett for Ashley. However, she never tells whether or not Scarlett ever gets Rhett in the end.",
            "Gone With the Wind is, obviously, my favorite book ever, but I truly believe it is one of the best ever written. I read this book when I was 12 years old, and I finished it in four days. I was so entirely engrossed in the setting, characters, and plot that I could honestly, literally just NOT put it down.Although the issue of which I am about to address did not bother or offend me in the least, however I am not racist or pro-slavery, I will talk about this in hope of enlightening a few more people and maybe helping to share the magic of GWTW. Sure, there are some things relating to racism, and of course to slavery, but I don't see why people are so offended by this. Yes, racism is wrong, and the way some slave owners treated their slaves, and how whites treated blacks, was absolutely horrifying, but, this is only a book. Slavery has long since been abolished and racism is now, thankfully, dwindling to almost nothing.At first, I'll admit, I was not fond of Scarlett, but after a while, I became used to her ways, and I really became absorbed into the book and felt as though I was walking in her shoes, and I understand why she did some things she did. The character development in this book is amazing; so is the extensive description.Gone With the Wind is such an amazing book for many reasons, but for me it has to be the ability which Mitchell has to take her readers into the story as though they were living the events themselves. I also loved the desperation and want Scarlett felt for Rhett as she realized she truly loved him, and of course, their stubborn relationship before they were married.There is not much more I can say that hasn't been said, except this: for hopeless romantics and avid readers (of which I am both), you will surely love GWTW. For everyone else: keep an open mind while you read. Remember that times have changed drastically and try to imagine if you were Scarlett yourself. Also, dive in the culture in which this book was written. Even if you don't agree with it, I believe everyone deserves an enjoyable read from of Gone With the Wind.",
            "Gone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell is a classic historical fiction novel with vivid descriptions of the Old South and the Civil War. It is from the Confederate's point of view, and the protagonist is Scarlett O'Hara, a headstron, stubborn, and spoiled Southern Belle with deep strength and passion. If Scarlett needs something bad enough, she will not hesitate to throw away proper social conduct or her own personal goals. This strength comes not from within her, but from using the misfortunes of others to her advantage. She is like a child in the sense that she orders people around and always gets her way. The problem in the long run is that this strenth all too often blinds her to the good things and the love that reaches out to her, but she pushes them away, so set in her own ways that she wont even consider other possibilities. Tara is Scarlett's one true love, and she would do anything for it. Scarlett survives the hardships of war as her would falls down around her with only her wit and determination left. She cannot ignore life, nor can she put on a polite mask and act as though there had never been a war. She uses the struggle to rebuild Atlanta to make her start in business. Although Scarlett is a strong and independent woman, most people can relate to her because she makes mistakes like a normal human. This book examines different types of strength. Whether it is Mammy's honorable courage and dignity, or Rhett's keen level-headedness, or Melanie's Christian devotion to people, each person has his or her own root from which they draw their strength. The writing is superb, and the plot is dramatic and sad, but it includes enough of Scarlett's triumphs of strength that sets it apart from all other books. This is a must-read for any person who loves classic literature.",
            "This book touched the hearts of millions, and truly makes us realize the appreciation of life. I found myself so much like Scarlett, that I began to chenge my ways, and learned to be a self-less person. You know how the book always better than the movie? Well, for those of you who saw the film, (probably the best film ever made; it was rated higher than Titanic!), you can imagine how good this book must be!!! Trust me-TAKE MY ADVICE! I AM A FULL TIME READER!!! THIS BOOK IS THE CREAM OF THE CROP!!!!!!!",
            "I had to add my accolades to those who declare GWTW the great American novel, and weigh the vote beyond the 4+ it currently has. Who are these people giving a novel so rich in in scope, so remakable in the development, so intense you can smell the magnolias, a one? It is the only book I have ever read more than twice. Double or tripple readings are only for those very, very special books, right? If it were not for the movie and the hype, the book would have more respect. GWTW forever!",
            "This is a great novel. Do not let its success fool you into thinking it isn't that good. I won't repeat the many positive reviews here. Just let me add one note: the book has an extraordinary amount of cynicism in it which is startling at first but makes perfect sense as this novel is about the destruction of all that is good by men-on a large scale, the south's destruction, on a smaller scale, the destruction of Rhett's love by the vices and selfishness of Scarlett.",
            "I have read Gone With the Wind 16 times(I'm eleven yrs. old)and it still ties for my favorite book(with The Mists of Avalon) I know all anyone would ever want to know about the movie(and a lot more besides)and plenty about the book. The ending is perfect and appropriate for the story, the characters are interesting, tightly intertwined into the story, and so real it feels like I am standing there in a hoop skirt and corset whenever I read the book(my waist constricts and everything)",
            "The book is as good as it can get. I read it while in high school, then again a few years later while in college. I'd like to read its sequel. The climax however was not quite as hunky dory as I would have liked it. It was one of my first books other than the normal run-of-the-mill stuff like adventure stories so its left quite a positive impact on me.",
            "I loved this book. I read it twice in the past year. The story is beautifully written. Margaret Mitchell is a genious. The quote &quot;After all tomorrow is another day,&quot; is the quote we all will repeat to ourselves to make life seem easier. Life goes on.",
            "I first read GWTW when I was 16 years old, and I've been spellbound ever since. This is a book that truly made me feel as if I'd known the characters for years; I cried with every defeat and celebrated every defeat with Scarlett. Once you pick it up, you can't put it down until it's finished. I felt that it was similar to &quot;North and South&quot; in content, but that the emphasis on the characters was more personal. Also, it has a little of everything--history (without being dull), romance (without being overdone), and personal triumph.",
            "&quot;GWTW&quot; is one of my favourite comfort books; &quot;War and Peace&quot; is another. They are similar in that they are sagas involving families whose lives are changed by war and how characters are affected by war. Some people fall to pieces and cannot contemplate a 'new' life where they have no place( Countess Rostova and Ashley Wilkes); while others find a hitherto unknown inner strength (Natalia Rostov and Scarlett). Margaret Mitchell took 10 years to write &quot;GWTW&quot;, thus starting the book in the '20's. She drew upon the stories that she had heard as a child from Civil War veterans and her own mother . Scarlett is the heroine of the book and there are very few scenes (as in the film) where she does not appear. &quot;War and Peace&quot; was also written over a long period of time. Tolstoy's work focuses on an exhaustive cast of characters, and places the reader in scenes domestic (&quot;peace&quot;) and foreign -the battlefields (&quot;war&quot;). Mitchell keeps her reader confined to Scarlett's side with third person references to battles and other factors of war. One could write a thesis ( as I felt I was beginning to!) on this topic. Let's just say that both are wonderful books; &quot;War and Peace&quot; is considered a &quot;Classic&quot;, while &quot;GWTW&quot; a classic example of historical fiction!",
            "Gone With The Wind is a superb book. It's story is so intresting. Margaret Mitchell wrote a wonderful book. I believe Gone With The Wind is my favorite book of all time and I can not wait to read it again. I love the way Mitchell describes Scarlett, Melanie, Rhett and Ashley. This is a literary gold!",
            "I think &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; was a great book. I liked the book better than the movie. The book went into more detail than the movie. I wish Scarlett would have waited for Rhett when he was in jail though. I wish Scarlett would have just admitted to Rhett that she loved him sooner. I think Ashley was kind of a wimp, and I did not understand why Scarlett had wanted Ashley when she had a man like Rhett who wanted her. I was glad when she tried to get him back at the end and I can't wait to get the sequel.",
            "I'm 16, just finnished it, the only regret I have is not reading it sooner. Mitchell did a beautiful job. I became so swept up into the story I couldn't put it down for a second. It's almost like be there, back in the 1800's, during the civil war. You feel the characters, there joy, there pain. The movie wasn't that great! I look forward to reading the sequal. I highly recomend this book, you won't be sorry after reading it.",
            "During the past summer I read a tremendous novel, Gone With the Wind. Margret Mitchell is an amazing author even by picking up the dilect of Mammy and the slaves. Even though I'm not American and don't study their history I understood and learned a lot from this book. This book is comedic, dramatic, exciting and filled with romance. The friends/foes/lovers relationship between Rhett and Scarlett is unforgettable. I found this to be a truly inspirational book, how to treat people properly and how to be a true friend and lover. This book is amazing , I couldn't put it down and I finished it in only 3 days. I am also starting to read the sequel &quot;Scarlett&quot; by Alexandra Riply. I give this book 5 stars! *****Jenn",
            "I have reread this book four times in the last year, and everytime I read it, I catch more than the previous time. The love story told compares to that of Romeo and Juliet. The sequencing of events could not be better; it grips you until the last page, and leaves you wondering how Scarlett deals with her personal losses. The intermixing of historical fact and fictional characters is phenomenal. Never again will a novel soar as high as this; it is as popular as the Bible.",
            "I think that it is the best story I have ever read!! It was magnificent detail, and includes everything, from history to love to war and action. Amazing the way Mitchell makes you think about everything. I would reccomend anybody who likes good reading, to read it.",
            "I read GWTW when I was in the 5th grade. I fell in love with it instantly, and have never read a better book since. This book has affected how I think and act. You can't help but admire Scarlett and all she stands for. At times all she had was her determination to survive and her pride. Once in school we had to do a report on the person we most admire. I had to convince the teacher to let me do it on Scarlett. Whenever I come to a hard time in my life, I try to be strong and I compare strong to Scarlett. This book tells not only how the South was affected but how the lives of the woman left behind were affected by the Civil War. The book is so vivid that you feel that you are with Scarlett, Rhett, and all the other unforgettable characters. I hope that I meet a man like Rhett. He loved Scarlett for years, knowing the worst of her but still loving her despite her faults. The book is the epitome of the Old South; with all the grace, beauty, and pride to go along with it.",
            "I loved this book! I love to read about the Civil War and this book takes you from the beginning to the end of this great time period. I'm 14 years old and a lot of my 8th grade classmates thought I was nuts to read it. But I didn't let that get in my way. I've seen the movie and don't think it got even close to the book. If you want to read a great romance/adventure/tradgedy this is the book for you!",
            "I read Gone With the Wind in the seventh grade, and since then have read it several times. To me it is an inspiration; its plot is magnificent, its characters well developed and true. It is a book that truly embodies the dream of writing the &quot;Great American Novel&quot;",
            "Gone With the Wind is the realization of an author's dream - to tell an American story of American attitudes in a deceptively treacherous society that became completely uprooted during an extended period of political turmoil in the United States. The characters are beautifully developed, the flavor of the period is flawlessly interwoven with the stories of the characters' lives, and we cling to each minor triumph and defeat as Mitchell works her way through this huge book. This is one book that you will want to read several times.",
            "As the ratings show, this book is accepted by many people to be the best book ever written, and I must agree. It has been a source of strength for me in hard times, and it guided me towards my love of writing.",
            "I have always loved Gone With the Wind. I found this edition here on Amazon and had my husband give it to me for Christmas. It is lovely. Book was in really good condition, too.",
            "The story begins with Scarlett O'Hara flirting outside her home with the Tarleton twins. The inciting incident was evident when Scarlett finds out that her beloved Ashley Wilkes is marrying that dreadful Melanie. The entire book spans the time of the Civil War and some reconstruction era. Gone with the Wind is a brilliant epic because it's about a love triangle and a young woman who is trying to find her place in the world. The setting is quite vivid, and if you live in the south, you know the heat and the vermillion sky. Of course, to read the book, even the name conjures up the images of Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable. The book itself, a classic indeed, isn't special. The words are verbose and at times rather pretentious. What makes this story amazing are the memorable characters.Scarlett O'Hara is the most obnoxious human being ever, but she's sympathetic. Thebook is at least honest in that it shows her motives. While other characters in the bookmisinterpret her greed and manipulation as strength, the reader knows Scarlett is quite selfish and egocentric. We see her continuous struggle with what society tells her and what makes perfect sense. The reader applauds her tenacity and refusal to accept hardships. Of course, in the book she's only 16.Rhett Butler is also rather vile as a womanizing, selfish renegade with little regard for the ways of high society. He's an older man by the standards of the 1860s at 27. What makes him so special is that he makes it quite clear that he can have sex any woman he wants, but he doesn't want to have mindless sex.He wants someone that interests him, can think for themselves, and he wants their attention. This person is Scarlett. Rhett is a man who knows what he wants. Of course, it's clear to the reader his acts of kindness aren't kindness but manipulated ways to get a hold of Scarlett.Ashley is the contrast to Rhett, a moral and kind man who is drawn to Scarlett but he loves Melanie. Ashley loves the idea of history, literature, and high society. Melanie is Scarlett's contrast. While everyone hates Scarlett, Melanie loves her and that drives Scarlett nuts.At the end of the book, the characters are the most memorable part of the book and considered a classic.",
            "There are few adjectives left, that hasn't been used to describe this book. Someone has written, that all Americans, should read this book, while they still can. The shipping was excellent and the book, is in better condition than described,and at very reasonable rates, an easy 5 Star Rating.",
            "I ordered this book due to the fact that my other one got destroyed....little siblings lol. The book cover is different from the one in the picture. The pic showed a blue cover with a gold like color for the title. The cover on the book I now have is of a man (Rhett) holding a women (Scarlett in his arms.. The book arrived a few weeks after having ordered it but thats ok. I wasn't about to allow my bookshelf to live out its life w/o having one of America's best classics on it. The book arrived in good condition and Im happy:)",
            "Bought this as a request for a friend who had seen the movie and wanted to have the book as part of her Margaret Mitchell collection. Buying from Amazon guaranteed that the item was shipped on time, well packaged and equally was budget friendly.",
            "I read this book in its entirety when I was 13 or 14, and of course I know far more now than I did then. I feel that if you can read this book with its historical context in mind and just appreciate it as a period piece and an exciting story, you'll be fine.I was thinking today about the fact that I read this book shortly after I read Little Women, the story of the March sisters whose dad was fighting the Civil War as a soldier for the Union. The contrast is great because while Alcott's book is filled with so many upstanding citizen types, Mitchell's story is peppered with the roguish Rhett Butler, the self-centered Scarlett, and an assortment of amoral characters. A few stand out as worthy of admiration--Melanie of course, Scarlett's mother, and Scarlett's beloved Mammy.I don't recall this book with the sentimentality that I hold for a simpler classic, such as Little Women. I loved the excitement, the adventure, the ironies. It thrilled me when Scarlett delivered Melanie's baby all by herself and when she said, \"As God as my witness, I'll never be hungry again,\" and proceeded to pick cotton in the fields like a \"common field hand\" as I think she put it. Her crush on Ashley thrilled me, and their long-awaited kiss was well worth waiting for! Somehow I couldn't quite cotton to the roguish, worldly Rhett and so their romance didn't thrill me, but nevertheless I was crushed when he abandoned her at the end. I remember asking my mom, \"Why?\" I just didn't understand why he couldn't have forgiven someone he supposedly loved so much.Just as in Little Women, I loved hearing about the fashions and balls. I tried to imagine what it would have been like to have been as popular as Scarlett! The obsession with thinness, so similar to our world with all the Jennifer Anistons today, interested me greatly. Imagine a 17-inch waist!I doubt whether I understood fully why she kicked Rhett out of her bedroom when she discovered that her waist measured a full 20 inches, leading her to the decision to stop having babies after Bonnie. And I'm embarrassed to admit that I thought Bonnie was a spoiled little girl, a miniature Scarlett, and I didn't cry when she died. But I cried when Melanie died, the woman who Scarlett had looked down upon all her life, only to finally realize that she was a great person.So much drama, so much excitement--wasn't it Melanie who suggested to Scarlett that they search the Union soldier's pockets after Scarlett had killed him when he entered Tara? I'm not sure but I remember that scene vividly from both the book and the movie when they realized that they'd both be raped by the home invader if they didn't do something fast!When I read this book as a young teen, I'd never read anything quite so adventurous or sophisticated. I'd never even seen the term \"sexual intercourse\" in print before, and now I was reading that Scarlett liked kissing, but marital relations didn't really appeal to her. My first adult book and I ate it up.If you can get past your hatred for the glamourization of slavery and see this book as a story from history, it's quite a fascinating tale. I mean who else but Scarlett O'Hara would fashion a dress from drapes and go to visit Rhett in jail in the hope of seducing him and achieving financial security for her and her family. Forgive me, but I can't help but picture Carol Burnett doing a skit as Scarlett, wearing the drapes, rod and all!This book probably deserves five stars just because it's a grand epic, but I need more of a love story, more inspiration than I found here. When the final words of a book are, \"Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn,\" this is too harsh for me.",
            "I fell in love with Gone With The Wind at age 14 when my mother gave me a copy. Now--many decades and books later--it is still my favorite book ever. I realize that it may seem dated to 21st century readers. But it was written in the mid-1930s, when society was vastly different. No other book has ever captured my imagination like GWTW. And Scarlett O'Hara Hamilton Kennedy Butler is hands-down my all-time favorite character. Yes, she was vain and selfish and willful, and spent years deluding herself about Ashley Wilkes. But she was also very brave and intelligent (and beautiful). While the rest of her family sat back bemoaning the past, Scarlett literally saved Tara. In my opinion, she was a surprisingly modern woman who, unfortunately, was ahead of her time. She lived in an era when strong, independent women were not acknowledged or respected... and for this, she paid a high price.Even though I loved Vivien Leigh's portrayal of Scarlett, I much prefer the book over the movie. GWTW is a book that can be revisited over and over again. I know I'll never get tired of reading it.",
            "Probably one of the very greatest fiction books of all time. Ms. Mitchell wrote a classic here with all the details of the Civil War enmeshed with Scarlett O'Hara and her tempetuous personality. Made into the movie in 1939 (and won the Best Picture Oscar that year), the book offers no disappointments. A true classic!",
            "I love Gone with the Wind it is my all time favorite book and movie. I found the movie edition on Amazon and just had to get it. The binding is coming off and I have to find someone who can fix it. But it is a great addition to my book collection. I am actually afraid to read it. It is sitting next to my copy of Rebecca of Sunnybrooke Farm movie edition book.",
            "This novel singlehandedly got me addicted to reading! I thought I didn't have time in my busy schedule, but now I make time! I never wanted this book to end!",
            "If you've not read this book, you better start right now! An unsurpassable classic...doesn't get any better than this...enough said.",
            "Mch more interesting than the movie.There is more character development,you understand why some people did the thingsthat they did",
            "Have to have such a classic in your home library. Nice shape. Good service. Will be a nice re-read this winter.",
            "It has been a long time since I read GWTW and hated Scarlett. I reread it with an adult's perspective of hardships, tough knocks and suffering, and while I still don't like Scarlett, I've come away with a greater appreciation of the hardships of living in an occupied land, 19th century societal expectations of women in the U.S.; and the tumult of changing social norms from one century to the next. It is a fascinating read.",
            "I can't believe it took me this long to get around to this book. It is honestly the best book I ever read.",
            "I remember reading this book a long time ago because I liked the movie. The book is definitely better. It's a very long book, over a thousand pages but a good story about love and determination.",
            "I fell in love with the movie first, so I thought i would give the book a try. For those who loved the movie, the depth of the characters and complicated feelings it brings, the book is even better. I love that it gives insight into characters that the movie doesn't have a chance to expound on.I always finish the movie wanting just a little more. The book helps satisfy a bit of that. Even having seen the movie countless times, the book was still a page turner.Some are offended at the glorification of the south and the misrepresentation of slavery in the book. I don't think it's wrong to find the perspective represented as very idealistic. But maybe take it more as a book written from the warped view that some probably had about their relationships with their slaves. It really is about the end of a civilization and their entire way of life.",
            "It is a wonderful classic and I enjoy it so much I savor the time I get to read it. It goes so much faster on my kindle.",
            "This copy is pretty much what the First Edition looked like in 1936 and it's easy to see how it got to be so big. Not until The Godfather was published had there been so much interest in a book and its inevitable film version. Impresses to this day and you can see the masterwork the film's screenwriters performed in getting this sprawling story onto the screen. I think every American should read this through at least once.God help the pukes making movies in this era who think they need to \"reboot\" this story... Also, don't bother with the \"authorized\" sequels; the story stands on its own.",
            "Great book just as I knew it would be. I can't believe that I've never read it til now. The movie itself is one of my all-time favorites, but they changed quite a few things which bugs me & the book's so much better. I can't wait to read \"Scarlett\" the sequel...",
            "GWTW is simply the most beautifully tragic work of literary art of the 20th century. Margaret Mitchell not only recaptures a lost shadow world, but she also creates characters of enduring depth and passion. Upon analyzing the characters it is easy to see how Melanie and Scarlett represent the two natures of woman as Rhett and Ashley represent the two natures of man . This two fold nature of man and woman, depicts the spiritual, emotional, physical, and material struggle of each sex. This heart breaking tale is not so much reflective a lost romance, but reflective of the inner and environmental struggle and development of the self and all that it entails.As for the \"sequel\"- yes on a surface level it satisfies those who are seeking closure. But that is the problem. There is no closure and that is what the rightful author intended. It is heart breaking yes, but that in and of itself offers a deep lesson to the reader. The heartbreak emcompasses not just the lost love between Rhett and Scarlett, Scarlett and Ashley, and Scarlett and Melanie- but the heartbreak of a time lost, pride forsaken, shame never to be laid to rest, and the stark reality of future yet known.All in all this is a breathtaking tragic journey that will ravage your heart and soul. Any serious literary reader will find timeless strength in these 1000+ pages of glory had and glory lost.",
            "I purchased several years ago, and I can't remember how many times I have read it. No matter how many times you do, the story always seems fresh. My paperback copy is falling apart, so I think I am going to purchase the hardcover version. My advice is to spend a little more on the hardcover, because once you have read this novel you will be hooked.",
            "What more can I say about this book. Only that it is second to the Bible in greatness and I that could be argued. I have read it before several times and each time I get something diffetent out of it.I was skeptical about getting the audiobook because a bad narrator can ruin a good book. However, Linda Stevens does justice and then some to all the regional dialects and takes nothing away from Margaret Mitchell's masterpeice.",
            "Gone with the wind is probably one of the best books i ever read.(let me tell you first that it took me an AWFULLY LONG TIME to read GWTW because im form mexico, so english is not my language.there were times when i tought i wasnt going to be able to finish it, but i kept on going and i finally did it)GWTW is really special for me because i read it when i was going through some really hard times and it really helped me to not give up.reading about scarlett and all the things that happend to her, and the way she used the people an the things around her so she could get what she wanted was really fun and inspiring.i took for myself her always useful \"charm\" I wont think about it now, ill think about it tomorrow.\" and it has really worked for me. everyone who likes to read a good story should read GWTW. you will grow fond of the characters in no time.the only thing i didnt like about it is that sometimes it can get really confusing , there were parts in the book i had to read twice so i could follow with the story. but in general its a really good book, and i am sure you will enjoy it as much as i did.",
            "This is one of the most memorable lines of all time. And uttered by Scarlett many times throghout the book, give it a fatalistic reality. Anybody who has ever been young, in love, would fall in love with Scarlett O'Hara, the greatest heroine of all time. Her charms are many and so are her bouts of temper, her fears, her desperations, her perceptions of life. This book is simply outstanding in every aspect. Margarett Mitchelle skillfully puts Scarlett's life under the microscope and disects it ruthlessly to give you a clear picture of youth, the pride of youth which is, believe me, terrible to behold, the vanity which rules the day, the plain pigheadedness that early age has and the heartbreak that follows when youth is gone overnight and adulthood encraoches.Don't at all be scared by the lenght of the book, it is very readable. I read this book for the first time when I was 14 and still had absolutely no trouble reading it, that says a lot about its readability. For 6 days I did little else than read with urgency to disclose Scarlett's fate. The book is so splendidly written, so complete in its rendition of that age, that from cover to cover that it encloses a world that is no more and exsists only in those pages. To think that this book was actually written 73 years after the Civil War of America began in 1860, is awe-inspiring in the sense that it seems the author could have had no means about knowing that civilization, the way she does with a completeness that is all encompassing, which was destroyed in that war, had not she been a part of it, saw the sun of those times, breathed the air that blew over Atlanta (where most of the story is based) and had the notions which she shared with those people. This is writing at its pinnacle of magnificience. She staight away begins the story from the word go in a no-nonsense way. There are no lenghty introductions of any kind, no changing in time frames or point of views (we solely see Scarlett's mind in the book though the book is in the first person), no telling about events even before they happen and the retrospection , if any, comes only on the charcters parts.And a very important thing, disbelieve all that jargon about it being in the greatest love story of all time. Infact it isn't a love story at all. Of course Scarlett does fall in love and has crushes that go nowhere, but the aim of the story is not to relate a mushy love affair but what circumstances do to people, how people are changed by the deeds they perform and how thay influence each other.We watch Scarlett fall in love. We watch her love with a passion and pursue her object of desire with a ruthlessness that only extreme youth is calable of. We watch her hate, with a coolness that is chilling to observe, hatred that only can be generated by hurt pride and stained vanity.Scarlett is young and beautiful and rich and brimming with life and health, no sorrow can touch her, and she sets out to conquer the world. Why should she not have everything she wants, every petty fancy fulfilled, every man falling in love with her? We know that the world dosent let such people be, these people invite almost too much jealosy, the world is very cruel to such people. So when the world does slap her across her face, she declares war aginst the world with her head held high. And still she is not a larger than life character, its as you or I would have reacted in such a situation, when you lived in a society in which she lived, if the world in which you lived was falling apart and war arrived at your doorstep. It potrays every kind of emotion a human ever went through and in all its splendor and glory.This story is also about tumultous times. It is the story of the Old South where innocent people lived the life of kings which is only present in memory. They are invincible in their paradise of cotton plantations and tea parties, but when war cuts through their lives like a knife, you can't but feel sorry for these people whose world ceases to exsist, and they live the rest of their lives serching like children for a meaning in their life they know isn't there, for an identity that has been erased, for salvation that will never come. Their inevitable tragedy breaks your heart and set at the heart of this interwining ouilt work of humanity lies the story of Scarlett. We see how she influences people around her and is changed herself in return by what she encounters.All in all the book is a treasure, one of the greatest contributions of America to the world of fiction and a must read for all generations. I recommend this book with all my heart. Read it and you'll thank the memory of Margarett Mitchelle for creating this piece of art.",
            "The book I am doing a review on is Gone With the Wind. This book is by the author Margaret Mitchell. This story is about an independent teenage girl named Scarlett O'Hara who lives in Georgia before the Civil War. She is in love with a boy named Ashley, and plans to be with him but he is arranged to be married with another girl, so Scarlett makes a big plan to make him hers, but before she can do it the Civil War breaks out and complicates everything for her. The front and back cover made me want to read it. If you are a person who loves adventure, suspense, and romance, then you should definitely read this book. This book is targeted for people between the ages of 15 and 70.The good thing about this book is that it has a plot that seems at some points seem irrelevant but are actually very important to the outcome of the resolution. If the book had even more conflicts then it would be even better because the conflicts make the story nail biting like this excerpt from the book. \"Somebody hollerin',\" said Porky uneasily. \"The Yankees are coming! I saw them! Down the road! The Yankees ---,\" Another thing I like about the book is that it has Scarlett, the main character, is a perfect mix of flare and emotions like this excerpt from the book. \"I don't want your advice,\" yelled Scarlett. I think this book has anything that I didn't like but if there were it would probably be the way there are many characters, but it sort of makes the story better, but for me it gets me confused sometimes like in this excerpt of the book. \"Well push Randa off you, Betsy, and hush. Now listen to me Gerald O'Hara.\" My overall opinion off the book is that I liked it very much. I think I like it so much because it contains a plot and setting that takes place in many different locations, it's not just stationary. So again, I think you should read this book because it contains vivid vocabulary, has triumphs and downfalls that make the story better, and has takes advantage of the readers' sense of adventure, and after watch the movie.",
            "A simply superb novel; it has become my favorite book. People of all ages can appreciate this masterpiece; I'm 16 and I couldn't put it down (not for food, sleep, or a six and a half hour flight), my 13 year old sister loved it, my little brother cried at the end, and an elderly woman and her husband, I met on the afore mentioned flight, said to me it was one of the best books of all time. &lt;space>Even though I had seen the movie -which I also love- so I knew what was going to happen, I wept uncontrollably. This is a must have and worth the 1024 or so pages. At the conclusion of this novel, the fact that it isn't any longer is the only disapointment. Reading it is a supreme pleasure.",
            "I agree with the hundreds...wait, millions of people over the years who've enjoyed this classic. Despite her charater not being too sympathetic, Scarlett is a real survivor and that's why we still care for her. If you haven't read the book because you already enjoyed the movie, you are really missing a lot.",
            "Oh, how I suffer for my enjoyment of this book! When I told a prospective lover that this was my fave tome, he recoiled in white liberal revulsion, demanding if I'd read `Roots'. The truth is that I have never read GWTW for the racism, and condemning it almost seems superfluous. I take it as read that this is a work of its time, written in the 1930s which harked back to the days of slavery and the ante-bellum South. A `Wuthering Heights' of the Confederacy, with its two passionate leads and wishy-washy support acts. Margaret Mitchell spend ten years writing GWTW, and it's perhaps thanks to her husband John Marsh, who persuaded her to write rather than read. After all she was an Atlanta journo in the 1920s and not short of a story or two... just what to do with them. The result is a 1000 page plus commotion which spans the years and charts the travels of various types, as they wind their way from having it all to down on their uppers to getting back up again. None more so than Scarlett O'Hara, who, fed up with playing the feminine card (which she nonetheless does to the hilt), benefits from the destruction of Southern life inasmuch as she answers her true calling - to be a better businessman than the boys. For which she pays the price of emotional loss, albeit of her own daft making.MM wrote at a time when many were denied the enfranchisement that we all deserve. And like many other works of the past, she falls foul of the politically correct watershed. But ignore the broadsheet bores if you dare, and see this novel for when it was conceived. And then relish the familiar themes of survival and in love with love and you might just enjoy it.",
            "The power of this narrative of the American Civil War and the Reconstruction period after the war is overwhelming. Scarlett O'Hara is the centerpiece of this story from the beginning to the end. It is much more than a story of love, rivalry, and misadventure. It is all that and more. It offers the reader a portrait of the Confederacy and the candid view of life there as filtered through the eyes of Scarlett. It is Melanie Hamilton and Ashley Wilkes who represent the values of the old South and the ambition of Scarlett and the cynicsm of Rhett Butler reflect the newly emerging South of the Reconstruction.",
            "It's racist and sexist, and some parts drag on a little too much, yet it made my heart flutter with delight. I love it when books make you feel like this one made me. It started off slowly, but 200 pages into it I was hooked.Scarlett, she's self absorbed and as thick as a brick, but some how loveable. Rhett, why he's condescending yet somehow so wise and sexy. And sweet Melly, while she is a goody-two-shoe, she is never annoying, quiet loveable. She has an inner strength. The characters come alive on the pages.Any book that makes me cry is a good book. Oh, and did I cry! THere were parts where I was blubering for ages. In other parts, my heart was racing and I couldn't read the page fast enough.Well, this book offically rocks my socks, and is one of my favourite books, ahead of Jane Eyre and Pride and Prejudice. Why oh why didn't I read this earlier?!? 6/5 stars!",
            "Gone Wind the Wind is famous for many reasons. First, its characters are so deep and certainly born with human flaws. The plot is amazing; it is neither cliche or \"dumb\". Mitchell has done an excellent job in her historical research - it's as if you were really there in that place and era!Scarlett and Rhett are some of the best characters in all literature. Some may hate Scarlett, although I don't know why. She is unique, intelligent, beautiful, and knows what she wants. You can't blame a pretty face for knowing she is pretty. And besides, she is not so superficial or mean as one may immediately suspect - Scarlett is a three-dimensional character who learns many lessons in the end. She is certainly amusing and vain, and you have to love her for it!Although I did not like the ending at first, it now occurs to me that it was reasonable. Scarlett has made a lot of mistakes, and you can't blame Rhett for not wanting to put up with it all anymore.I know most people will enjoy this book, and it is not racist. It appears to be to the ignorant mind, but you have to understand that people spoke and behaved in such ways at this era. You cannot have black people and whites living in harmony during the Civil War, 1860's, right? This is a historical novel. And besides, doesn't anyone remember that Scarlett mentions how her black nanny is always there for her, is trustworthy and good? She does not disrespect African Americans.",
            "I read over 150 books a year, and I always have read a lot. I don't go for romance at all, but this book is so much more than that. The writing is fantastic. The vocabulary is diverse. The imagery. The characters. The plots within plots. You are there. You know the characters intimately. This is the most amazing work of fiction I have ever laid eyes on.I'm not big on re-reading things, but I've read this novel many, many times. Buy it. Read it. Treasure it.If you're \"offended by the racism,\" please try to keep in mind that political correctness will destroy your education. And whether or not this book is racist (can a _book_ be racist?) does nothing to diminsh from its genius.",
            "There were times in this book when I would be so absorbed in the story that I lost all track of time and would be surprised to discover that things had changed about in my house because everyone else was continuing on with real life.This book is so vividly portrayed. Sometimes you can almost feel the heat, hear the flies buzzing, smell the smoke from the burning buildings, hear ladies in fancy shoes schlooching through the mud.This is an epic classic. The story follows Scarlet, a hard-bitten-or-is-she Southern belle, as she goes about the process of living just before, during, and after the Civil War. It's an amazing book for any number of reasons. One, a woman writes about war and just about blows the socks off the idea that only men can do that. Two, nearly every character you meet is a well-developed person, not just some caricature. Three, details of life like cooking, nursing babies (yes, breastfeeding...), eating, dressing, flirting, dancing, everything is there. I'm surprised there isn't any toilet scene, so much is covered here. Four, tragedies of every sort occur, from Scarlet and Rhett's love story to Scarlet and Ashley's love story to Scarlet and Melanie's friendship to the loss of Bonnie. So many things happen.If you ever thought that the Civil War was a right and just war and that the South got what it deserved, consider reading this just for the opportunity to challenge your conventions and long-held beliefs.",
            "&quot;There was a Land of Cavaliers and Cotton Fields called the Old South. . .Here in this pretty world Gallantry took its last bow. . .Look for it only in books, for it is no more than a dream remembered. A Civilization Gone with the Wind.&quot;What other words could more perfectly describe the saga of Gone with the Wind?I am always astounded when I think that the 1024 pages of Gone with the Wind was Margaret Mitchell's first book! How can a green author roll so much passion, hope, strength, love, steadfastness, despair and humanity into a single novel? I blows me away, no pun intended!As reviewer kitam57 said &quot;I love Scarlett and yet at the same time I want to wring her neck.&quot; I totally concur, I admire Scarlett for her determination, her dedication to her family, her love of the land and her uniqueness. I'm more than half Irish and I too have a love for the land I live on just like Scarlett developed for Tara, as her father said &quot;It's the only thing that lasts&quot; and truly, even when Scarlett had nothing else she still had Tara and was willing to do anything, even prostitute herself to Rhett in order to keep it. She wasn't afraid to go out and break many of the social conventions of the time, like peddling lumber while pregnant, in order to take care of her family and loved ones. But at the same time, I HATE her treatment of Rhett, Scarlett had one giant blindspot by the name of Ashley Wilkes. Although, Ashley did lead her on, he never would say that he didn't love her and only loved Mellie. Scarlett clung to this hope, she pretended to hate Rhett the whole time and really deep down she knew she always liked him. I just can't understand why Scarlett thought she loved Ashley so much, he was dreamer, lost in books, music and Europe while Scarlett was practical, living for each day and facing up to harsh realities without a second thought.Rhett was always hopelessly in love with Scarlett too. It breaks my heart every time I see him try in the book and she just blows him off. When he was released from prison he ran straight to Scarlett to make sure she had enough money to keep Tara, when Scarlett tells him she's pregnant again he's so happy, and when he thinks Scarlett will die I cry too when he is nearly crazy with grief and sobbing into Mellie's skirts! There was still a chance for them later if she had just opened up and admitted that they had both been wrong! And that &quot;hungry&quot; look of Rhett's that Scarlett was always a bit scared of, it was really Rhett's starvation for love. He was watching her, waiting and hoping that she might show him some sign of love, as he said he wanted when they first danced together. Rhett's weakness was Scarlett and his need for her love, for once in his life he wanted someone to TRULY love him, not look down on him! And then tragedy enters in.Rhett of course has his scoundrel tendancies, but I admire him also for his rebellion against social conventions, he wasn't tied in by stupid traditions. he was more thinking than the rest, in that respect he and Ashley were more alike. Rhett and Ashley both knew what a war would do to the South and what a disadvantage they were at with troups and artillery. As Rhett said: &quot;I seem to be spoiling everyone's brandy, cigars and DREAMS of victory.&quot; Rhett's humanity always shows through in his admiration of Melanie, she was the one person he always treated with absolute sincerity and genuine respect.There also is the war aspect, Margaret Mitchell seems to have examined every tiny detail of the the South both during and after the war. She knows of the hardships, devastation, the starvation, the struggle, the indignities and humiliation of Reconstruction. One must always remember that just because people owned slaves, it didn't mean they were all bad people. Some were, we all know of the atrocious horrors that slaves suffered but, Margaret Mitchell shows the almost family-like relationships some people shared with their slaves. They do talk down to them and treat them as children, but slaves were not always educated at the time and therefore some didn't know how to act any differently. Mammy however is the perfect example of the smartest woman in the whole book! She always knew what was going on and loved Scarlett as her own child no matter what depths Scarlett sank to.I love the movie as well, Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable were Scarlett and Rhett brought to life, it's like they were born to play those roles! My only complaint is that they should have shown Scarlett's children with Charles and Frank in the film! However, I will always applaud the scene of Scarlett and Rhett dancing around in black amongst all the other colorful people. They are declaring their defiance and I completely admire that! In fact, I love the story of Gone with the Wind so much that I named my horse India after Ashley's sister. Next one I should name Scarlett! :)All in all, Gone with the Wind is a book for all time, no matter what your genre of book is, you will be able to appreciate it for the many dimensions of it and the ultimate truth, history, life lessons and basic human tenacity it portrays. No matter who you are, where you live or how old you are.",
            "What can I say? I am so glad to finally and proudly join the GONE WITH THE WIND readers. I have tried reading this book for years. I am SO glad I put nose to grindstone. Once I got into the story I was reading every chance I could get. And now that I am done, I am rereading snippets ... not willing to let the story go yet.What a miraculous book, a miraculous accomplishment, a masterful writer. The writing is eerily alive. Simply a brilliant brilliant work.The book is very true to the times. I have read many first hand accounts of that era, including hundreds of Slave Narratives and Margaret Mitchell told it like it was. To say this book is racist is just plain stupidity.We shouldn't read history because it's just not nice, it's just not the way we would do things, us being such enlightened souls.Waaah. Waah.How stupid. This book is about another place and time. DUH. Do a search on Black slave owners and Black confederates if you dare.As far as the human relationships in this book I rode a roller coaster.I personally loved the loyalty shown between slave and owners. &quot;they are part of our family&quot; It's true to the way it really was except the slave narratives are even more emotional and dramatic stating over and over &quot;I just want to go to heaven and see my mastus and missus again. They are the best on the whole world&quot; It's incredible. I am not talking about the selected slave narratives telling all manner of horror. I am talking about he Federal Works project that talked to actual ex-slaves and their families.As for Rhett, I had a hard time liking him. He was dashing at first but his &quot;career&quot; during the war turned me off. His fine clothes and such while people starved bothered me.... But then he proposed to Scarlet and he was so romantic and I started to really like him. I even liked him in the parlor scene when he was drunk and tortured over Scarlet's wandering heart.But by the end I didn't like him much again. I thought it was really scoundrelish of him to simply say &quot;I'm tired of it, I'm tired of you&quot; Frankly my dear I don't give a damn.Him and Scarlet had both sunk so low. I didn't like their long violent fights. It really pained me. When Scarlet was sick ... oh that broke my heart how Rhett cried into Mellie's skirt.If only... If only ...That is a very difficult part to swallow with this book ... and yet it is still a &quot;right&quot; end.I loved Ashley for his Southerness and Melanie was a beautifully wrought character. I wish Scarlet would have proclaimed her love for her more surely though. They could have lain on the bed and recounted all they had been through together.This is not just a book. It is an experience.I am SO glad that Margaret Mitchell wrote this book, a book from the South. I hope it remains in print. A people and a way of life that is Gone With The Wind will always deserve to be heard and understood.",
            "Why didn't I read this magnificent book before I was 49 years old?Perhaps because it tends to be classified in the &quot;historical romance&quot; genre ... because it was a vast popular success ... followed by a blockbuster movie ... it isn't taken seriously as a classic. It wasn't on academic reading lists, while works such as William Faulkner's &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; and Carson McCullers' &quot;The Heart is a Lonely Hunter&quot; were. But it should be.Probably GWTW couldn't have been written at any other time than it was, or by anyone else. When Margeret Mitchell was born in 1900, many living adults had been through the war and reconstruction years, and were there to tell her about it. Hers was the last generation to grow up before radio, when the oral tradition remained vital and dominant. Yet, as a child of the suffragist era and somewhat of a social rebel (engaged once, married twice, etc.), Mitchell's feisty personality is expressed through Scarlett O'Hara with rich comic effect. I frequently burst out loud laughing at Scarlett's outrageously self-serving rationalizations, and the scandalous breaches of etiquette she perpetrates. This is anything but melodrama or bodice-ripper romance. It is sophisticated social comedy, as well as historical drama and tragedy.Scarlett O'Hara, Rhett Butler, and Ashley and Melanie Wilkes endure in cultural memory to this day because Margaret Mitchell takes us into their world so convincingly that they seem real, with all their strengths, weaknesses, vanities and foibles. She has an unerring ear for dialogue. The black servants are vivid characters, pictured sympathetically as generally speaking their minds and being their authentic selves, in contrast to the ego-preserving dissembling and self-delusion of the whites.Despite the entangling of Scarlett's life with Rhett, Ashley and Melanie throughout the story, old Mammy -- the matron of the servants -- is the character who graces both the first and last pages of the book along with Scarlett. She is the only one who never betrays or leaves Scarlett; who stands with her till the end.Books about the Civil War era and its aftermath must number in the tens of thousands. But none brings it alive and lets you see it, feel it and remember it as GWTW does. It is a masterpiece, a monumental achievement.What does GWTW mean to me? At my grandmother's gravesite in East Texas, nearby tombstones cite the deceased's CSA affiliation ... 1st N.C. Cavalry, and so forth. These old soldiers migrated west after the war, just as Margaret Mitchell describes. They were my great-grandparents' generation. Margaret Mitchell brought their world alive to me as no one else ever did or could.Thank you, Margaret Mitchell, for your magnificent life's work.",
            "I can't belive i made it to 30 without reading the novel! I had seen the movie countless times and always liked it. But when I finally picked up the book and decided it was high time I read it, I was blown away. I'm captivated by Scarletts strength and courage, her honesty, and even her vanity. I couldn't put it down and now I'm ready to start all over again. If you haven't given this book a chance, do it now! You'll wish you had read it at 16.",
            "Margaret Mitchell impressed me by writing an 800 page novel about a character I sometimes wanted to strangle but about whom I couldn't read enough. Scarlett O'Hara might be self-absorbed, provincial, and manipulative, but she also displays courage, resourcefulness, and determination. Gone with the Wind is more than just a love story; it chronicles Scarlett's growth from a spoiled planter's daughter to the head of a household struggling to survive the ravages of the Civil War and Reconstruction. Mitchell provides a fascinating depiction of the psychology of the South, which plays a critical role in Scarlett's story. To thrive, she finds she must alienate the remnants of her former life and accept the presence of the Northern invaders. Throughout Scarlett wrestles with her feelings for Ashley Wilkes, a noble refugee from the genteel past, and Rhett Butler, a scalawag building his fortune from the ashes of the confederacy. Many more wonderfully drawn characters fill out this novel, which already feels somewhat compressed despite its length. It's no wonder the movie version is four hours long; the novel has too much too good to leave out!",
            "This book is just one of the best books ever. I can read it over and over again. I just love the story, the characters, the history, everything!Undoubtly the best book ever written....",
            "Great condition. I am really enjoying it. Can't believe it took me 68 years to finally read this.",
            "It was a very loooong book but really good! Usually with long books there's always a part that drags on forever but it never felt that way with this book. It always kept my interest and the ending was different and not at all what I expected, which is a good thing.",
            "I have always been a lover of the film, but I am so glad I finally read this book. It was packed with fascinating history and a wonderful set of characters. It is a long book, but definitely worth the effort! Its epic story and beautifully written dialogue paint a picture of the Confederacy, its fall and Reconstruction. This is a story of survival and the pure gumption it takes to get ahead. I recommend this book to anyone who likes a good read!",
            "I saw the movie GWTW as a kid, but the memory faded over time. I never thought to read the book, but took it out of the library on audio CD. What a wonderful, memorable, amazing book. Scarlett, Wrett, Ashley and Melanie are extraordinary portraits, and anyone interested in US history will find much to enjoy with the story set against the Civil War.Linda Stephens audio CD narration is spot-on, painting a nuanced compelling portrait of the characters and story.So worth going beyond the film!",
            "I wish Margaret Mitchell had written more than one book. She was a talented writer and one of the best story tellers. Love her vivid description of war scenes and dialogues. Truly a classic, a great piece of American literature!",
            "I love this book. I love these characters. I love how it's 1,000 pages long, so you don't have to leave the amazing world depicted too soon. I love how you can curl up with this book and read it for hours on end and never come to the last page. It's so completely absorbing, so real and life-like, so undeniably painted, that it's more than classic. It's a masterpiece. I asked for this book for my Confirmation present, and I will cherish it and show it to my children and my children's children. I hope to God that this book is never forgotten. It is simply beautiful and romantic.",
            "I really enjoyed reading this long novel and have to say that I was sad when it was over. Aside from being very easy to read and an interesting story line, the settings in rural Georgia and Atlanta during the civil war provide a realistic historical feel that you don't get from reading history books on the civil war. I have since read a history book on Sherman's march to the sea and realize that the general descriptions in Gone With The Wind about what happened to the residents of Georgia are true. Whether you want a more personal insight into what life was like during the Civil War in the south, or just a really enjoyable book to read, I would highly recommend Gone With The Wind. Also, ignore some of the book covers that make this book look like a love story, it is a book of equal interest to men and women in my opinion.",
            "Scarlett O'Hara was never intended to be the heroine in this novel, but like all dynamic characters, she took over the tale. In reality, Margaret Mitchell wrote Melanie as the heroine, and I think the fact that Melanie shines so gently throughout the tale is one of the many things about this novel that makes it exceptional.Mitchell wrote this novel because she wanted to show how different women managed to survive the American Civil War. Thus, Melanie, Scarlett, India, and Ellen. These women each coped differently to outlive the greatest war of their century in America, and the fact that Scarlett stood so high above the others is a testament to her larger-than-life validity.This novel is, and shall forever more be, my favorite piece of literature.",
            "This book has been a personal favorite of mine since I was in Elementary School. Yes, I was born a book worm with an advanced reading level. I was named for Ashley from this very book and my brother was named for Rhett so I was required to read it, but not required to like it I just happened to fall in love with Margaret Mitchell and her story. It tells so many stories in one and has such an appeal to it no wonder it is still going strong after almost 75 years. I would recommend this book to anyone, although girls seem to enjoy it more as it is told by Scarlett's point of view. Scarlett is the girl you love to hate. She is so endearing and strong but so young and naive that you want to hit her and shelter her at the same time. Rhett is a man's man and women across the world want to have him. He exudes all that is strong and masculine while being head over heels in love with Scarlett and their baby girl. Ashley is a pity case as he is torn and used. Melanie is a personal favorite of mine, like a pet kitten. She is fierce and strong with claws of steel but purrs and mews with the innocence and undying love of a newborn baby kitten. All of the characters are developed well and are all very rounded. You will get lost in this time period and forget what a cell phone is.",
            "At the insistence of a friend, I picked up Gone with the Wind to see what all the hubbub was about. I expected a shallow romance novel, much like the movie it spawned, complete with the longing stares and the yearning desires of a woman who has been spited by circumstance. I could not have been more surprised to find so much more.What I found was a novel that is surprisingly layered. The outermost layer, of course, is the romantic narrative many will recognize, but beneath this superficial casting resides a deeper narrative about the tragic hubris, resulting fall, and struggle to reemerge by a small class of Southern aristocrats. As this historical narrative unfolds, additional layers advance and recede in waves, each ushered in with insightful dialogue and commentary by the book's fascinating characters.At the base of their hubris, for example, is layered an adolescent confidence in the invincibility of King Cotton and the superiority of the antebellum order, which one character ridicules and one character fears will prove all too true. Surrounding their fall, their economic and political naivety retreats before scarcity, Sherman, and a struggle to survive, all of which is replaced by a remarkable perseverance that is more a testament to the antebellum order than anything before the war. As their struggle plays out in the treacherous climate of Reconstruction, it eventually turns into a modest triumph capped by tragedy and accompanied by ominous undertones of the segregated order to come.Other layers abound and while each is fascinating in its own right, together they are interwoven to present an even more fascinating and coherent telling of the most tumultuous period in American history. Rather than shallow, Gone with the Wind is exceptionally deep, its characters eminently profound, and its telling extremely satisfying.",
            "What can I say? This one is a classic! A very good historical romance set in the south during and after the Civil War. I cannot help but love and hate Scarlett O'Hara, both for her feisty spirit, her stubborn disposition, and her passion for the unobtainable. If you've never read this book, you should.",
            "Yes, the book is racist, but let's cut Mitchell a little slack. She was a person of her place and time. There were no documentaries to compete with \"Birth of a Nation,\" no internet, and entire towns were segregated. Most white people never heard the other side of the story. Who is to say what Mitchell's attitudes would be today? Probably, like most of the country, she would have become much more thoughtful.While it's tough not to cringe at the casual use of the n-word and \"darky\" in the book, it is what Mitchell knew. Even sweet, precious Melanie decried going up north because her son would have to go to school with \"pickaninnies.\" Forgiving her for romanticizing a vile, inhuman system that degraded women of all colors, \"crackers,\" and black men is easy, because she knew little else. There is no excuse for the twits who swoon over the book and ignore inconvenient facts, because they know better (or should).It takes nothing away from the fact that Mitchell was an awesome writer who could bring characters and settings to life like nobody else. She and J. K. Rowling are about the only two writers who can keep me up reading at night when I have to go to work the next day.",
            "When I read the first sentence of \"Gone with the Wind\" I was forever hooked. The description of the glitz and glamour of Southern life, the odd perspective on the civil war, the turbulence of Rhett Butler's and Scarlett O'Hara's stormy relationship,it is all so well-crafted. The only reason why one might hesitate to read the book is, it was written by a Southener and you do have to endure insults hurled upon the \"darkies\". The good \"darkies\" are the ones that decide to stay with their masters, and it is very unrealistic in that sense. Other than that, it is worth reading. Two thumbs way, way up!",
            "I love this book. I could read it over and over again. While it isn't very well written, it has the ability to take you there into the story and forget everything going on around you. It gives you a lot more detail then the movie, and makes you understand the characters more. You can really understand the motivation behind some of their actions.",
            "GWTW is undoubtedly an american classic for more reasons than one - sweeping storyline, strong characters and just the flow of simple lucid narrative prose that keeps you going from page to page with sustained interest (not an easy job if it is 700 pages!). I read it a few times when i was young, just fell in love with the movie and it is part of my library collection as well. I still enjoy the color and splendor and perky dialogue although the book is too long to read again with other reasons too.As i grew i figured out what was missing underneath the sentiments we have for it. There is not one word against racism or intolerance or suffering undergone by others during those times. Yes the south lost it all but times and lives change, some cruelly others more slowly with time - it is a natural order of things to change and intolerant lifestyles definitely have to. Lot of people have a longing for good times gone, but it needs to be laced with feelings for what caused it to happen and does not automatically mean bad times have come. I would think hidden beneath the huge popularity of the book so many years after it was made is partly love for simpler times but a lot of guilt for simplistic and intolerant ways of the past that were hidden by economic prosperity and picture postcard lifestyles.",
            "I have watched the movie a zillion times. So since I liked the movie so much I thought I would read the book too. I was amazed how much better the book was than the movie. It goes into great detail and you get the entire story. And since I live in Georgia I'm learning about my culture. And I also found out that not all folks who owned slaves were cruel to them. Actually some of their owners were good to them. And also I fell in love with all the characters. I hate Scarlett but yet I love her too. She is like me in a lot of ways. We are both selfish and spoiled. And we both let our conscious get the best of us. I recommend this book to everyone. It is amazing. I never read a book before until now. I can never put it down. I have now read 4 times and gets better each time. It's nothing like the movie. It's far better!",
            "Gone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell, is a captivating book about the southern way of life in the 1860s. Scarlett O'Hara, the main character in the book, is a young, outspoken girl for her times who lives on a big plantation, Tara. Gone With the Wind goes through the tough times of the Civil War. Scarlett wants a man that she can't have, Ashley Wilkes. She ends up marrying Ashley's cousin, Charles Hamilton, just to spite Ashley, but Charles died in war two months later. She found out she was pregnant with his child and named him after Charles's troop leader, Wade Hampton Hamilton. Scarlett waited awhile before she married her sister's beau, Frank Kennedy. She had a baby girl with him also, Ella. Frank was killed while attempting to kill the carpetbaggers who attacked Scarlett on the way to the lumber mill that they owned. She immediately married Rhett Butler, a urbane man that everyone loves to hate. She has yet another child with him, Bonnie Blue. I would recommed the book Gone With the Wind to anyone because its a twist of romance and survival.",
            "Almost everyone had heard of the beautiful Scarlett O'Hara and the way she can make men weep. The book, Gone with the Wind, though enthralling through 1,022 of it's pages, with it's can't-put-this-book-down events, unexpected turns, tragedies and historical content, has an, in my opinion, very unsatisfactory ending. According to some, it's &quot;The greatest love story of our time. Maybe it is, but the conclusion to the love triangle of Rhett, Ashley and Scarlett was left off as if it were not the end, but the beginning. I suppose it could be argued that you should use your imagination, and that the author wanted to escape those cliche of the studly man living happily ever after with the beautiful damsel but the last two pages left me wanting more. However, if you're the type of person who can deal with not-really-the-end endings, I would really recommend this book. Although it has maybe, an overabundance of pages, Scarlett's life takes many unexpected turns and you sometimes you get so enraptured in the excitement and tragedy that you find that you've read several pages and not even realized it. This book is also full of historical information about the civil war, looking at it from the very different perspective of the women of the south. Margate Mitchell has a way of writing that always keeps you guessing and feed you words of wisdom to live by. Almost like one really long tragic soap opera.",
            "Of course I love GWTW. I have read it at least a hundred times and it never fails to capture me. However, I want to make it clear to those who have children who wish to read GWTW, or if you are a young person yourself, that this is a novel which glorifies the ideals of the 'old south'. And that 'old south' so dearly loved and cherished by the characters of the book is one built with the sweat and blood of thousands of African Americans, and not those who reaped the benefits of slavery. By all means, enjoy this book for its romanticism. However, I think it is imperative that such misguided idealism and blatent cruelty must be treated as such and explained to those who are still rather impressionable.",
            "Gone with the Wind changed my point of veiw on the Civil War and how hard women worked and tried to be ladies. Scarlett worked hard to prevent Tara from being taken away and preventing hunger of her family. My point on the Civil War was southerners were terrible people but GWTW changed changed all that, most people treated their &quot;workers&quot; or slaves as part of the family and were happy. It was the yankee's who were terrible the wouldn't let the south be they had to torture them. The story is very good and if you haaven't read it YOU MUST READ IT.",
            "this book has endured the many years because it is so well written...yes, we all know the story by heart, and have seen the movie (probably SEVERAL times..) but what a great read! truly a 20th century \"romeo and juliet\"!",
            "\"Gone With the Wind\" is about a Southern belle, Scarlett O'Hara, during the Civil War and Reconstruction. Scarlett is a headstrong girl that is different from other girls. She gets married young, then becomes a widow. When death of many of her closest friends and family die, as well as escaping from the Yankees, she changes for the worse. She tries to win the attention of the so-called love of her life, while trying to keep the respect of her neighbors, who think she's scandalous. Will she survive with the ways in which she was brought up?",
            "If you only read one literary novel of the Old South read Gone With The Wind.",
            "This book was very well written and except for a few intense parts and some language, I thought it was an awesome book! Very interesting. It is about a southern belle and how the Civil War changed her life. It is about her determination and how she made it through no matter what. :) :) :) Read it for yourself and see!",
            "Long book, and it hurts your eyes to read it, but it is well worth reading. So often we hear of the north's view of the war, and now we see it through the strong southern belle, Scarlett. Scarlett isn't nice, in fact she's very down to earth and reflects the flaws as well as the compliments women today share. She is spirited and willing to risk it all to never go hungry again, after feeling the poverty and hunger once Sherman swept through. Unlike many southerners, she realized that the past is gone with the Wind and she must break ties with society in order to stay strong, alive, and comfortable.",
            "One of the best books and best movies ever is Gone witht he wind. I have seen the movie lots and decided to read the book and the book is as good as the movie. The book and movie are almost the same butt he movie dosent include some of Scarletts children born before rhett. I loved the way the book is written and it's characters are classics. The only thing is the book is long a little to long at times but still it's a great read.",
            "\"Gone with the Wind\" by Margaret Mitchell is one of my favorite books of all time. Scarlet O'Hara, the foolish southern belle is in love with Ashley Wilkes, a scholar who won't have anything to do with her. To rebel, she marries his fianc&eacute;e' s brother and when the war breaks out, it turns ugly. She is then forced to move to Atlanta to her husband's house. In Atlanta, Georgia during the Civil War things aren't easy. It is hot and sandy. The sticky humidity is horrible to live in yet the feeling of \"home\" is evident everywhere. There are always barbecues and lazy afternoons up till the war. The south is mostly cotton fields, with little factories while the north is full of manufacturing. Things don't look too good for the south when the war breaks out and to make everything worse, the ports are soon closed off. All too soon Scarlet feels the bitterness of war as her childhood friends die for a losing cause. When she finds Atlanta being attacked by General Sherman she must flee for safety and there is nowhere to go.This story is about a girl who has been spoiled her entire life and then must learn to do things on her own. She faces the fact that she can't have everything and that she has to make sacrifices. Her whole life she has been the brat that depends on everyone else so she can't do anything on her own. She is blinded by her own insolence to the truth that nothing is fair. Sweet Melanie, her sister in law is kind to her and is too sweet hearted to see the wrong in anyone; she doesn't see how corrupt Scarlet' s mind is. She is always on Scarlet' s side despite the horrible things that she does. Scandalous Rhett Butler loves Scarlet for her foul heart and chases her throughout the whole book. Rhett has a history for doing unthinkable things to girls. (Unthinkable at the time; refusing to marry a girl he courted, publicly kissing, etc.) Everyone despises him for making a profit off of the war. All proper people support the failing cause and Rhett makes fun of them. He is a businessman, so nothing is personal till he meets Scarlet. As time progresses, Scarlet comes to realize the damage that she has done with her being wicked to everyone. She literally is and was a spoiled brat. Her suffering teaches her a lesson that we all should learn.If you love historical fiction with a little romance, this book is perfect for you. Scarlet is the perfect Southern belle who is incredible to read about. How she attracts men with her charm and little helpless acts is unbelievable. She is used to having slaves serve her and she treats them with little or no respect until she needs them. You cannot stop thinking about how much you would hate Scarlet if she was real, but you can't stop feeling sorry for her and you want to help her to realize how stupid she is.In this book you have a look at how the south was before and after the Civil War. They were still people with feelings, not horrible people who were wicked. You fall in love with the chivalry and way of life. You also realize how wrong slavery was. Even they knew it was wrong, they just couldn't imagine life without the slave labor. I think that the book is written well, you see why people did things and the reasoning behind their actions. I didn't always agree with what Scarlet did, but I knew why she did things. The book is very interesting and I couldn't put it down at all. I certainly would recommend it to just about anyone. I certainly understand the era better now. The book got me interested in other books about the war and now I can see why people felt the way they did. I can see the good and bad in slavery. I feel that lack of education on the issue is what caused such disastrous effects.Emily Norrod",
            "I had seen the movie and while I liked it, I HATED Scarlet. O.k. she's not my new best friend, but I understand her so much more now! And although I knew what was coming, I still cried in certain parts. By the time I closed the book, I thought if Scarlet didn't get Rhett, I would just die! Excellent book! If you haven't read it, pick it up!",
            "This a fabulous book. I think it is much better than the movie. A must for anyone, who loves to read. It is prefect for history fans. I have read and re-read this book many times. It is one of my favorites. It is set in the Civil War era. It is about Scalett O'Hara and Rhett Bulter. It was later made into a movie, starring Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable. Scallet is very independent women, who is famous for her green eyes, and her red hair, that explains her fiery temper. who first gets married to Charles Hamiltion. He's sister is Melanie, who becomes the wife of Ashley, the man, Scarlett wants but can never have. She has a a son, Wade, with Charles. Then she keeps her family together,--anyway she can. She even kills a Yankee. Then she marrys Frank Kenndy, to pay the taxes on Tara. She has a daughter, Ella, with him. He dies while having to Klu Klux Klan. She marrys Rhett. The have a fiery romance. They have a daughter, that Rhett names Bonnie Blue Butler, because her eyes were as blue as the Bonnie Blue Flag. This book closes with Scarlett pronouncing the famous words, \"After all, tomorrow is another day!\"",

I LOVE THE BOOK EVEN MORE THAN THE MOVIE. SO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? BUY YOUR COPY ALREADY.",

            "we all love the movie with the leery Clark Gable and the fiery Vivien Leigh- but the novel is much, much more. With this classic, you find yourself bonding with Scarlet- hating her for her obstinate obsessions and agreeing with her basic desires. Melonie Hamilton isn't quite as serene as the movie, but she is just as goodie-goodie. Rhett Butler is good. I'm a high school student, and I read Gone with the Wind in the sixth grade. it was fabulous and everyone should be exposed to the all-too human Scarlet O'Hara.",

We meant to replace it for more than a year, and I came up with the idea to surprise her with it, and her birthday was the perfect time. She told me once that while in high school the book was assigned and she just could not get herself through it, but it was a big deal at the local theater and viewing the movie helped her ace the test! Then post graduation she picked up the book and the rest is history. My purchase has made me a hero. My thanks for filling the order quickly and the timely delivering was greatly appreciated.",

            "Remembering when this book, \"Gone With The Wind\", first came out, my mother told me that my her brother, a doctor from Montreal Canada, who had settled in the USA, had read it all the way through, finding it compulsively readable. Years and years, (and years!), later, on the 50th Anniverary of GWTW, (the movie, I think), TV GUIDE ran two -- or perhaps it was three -- articles on this book / movie phenomenon. One was a general overview of the movie, and comments from surviving leading players. The other two were equally as fascinating: one was written by a White woman, the other, by a Black man.The White woman said that the value she had gotten from this book was that she had learnt from it, to withstand any hardship, no matter how great.The Black man said that he had been SO ashamed to buy this book. As much ashamed as he would have been, had he bought a pornography book! After reading it, he opined that it did NOT focus on the cruelty, pain, and degradation of slavery, but instead on a woman in love with another woman's financee and later, husband. He compared the book to a hypothetical novel set in World War II, wherein a Nazi officer, a guard in a concentration camp, was having a romance with a secretary. The pain and suffering of so many people, all around them, is all but ignored, in this hypothetical book, as all the attention is on the two lovers. Obviously, the Black gentleman who wrote this article for TV Guide did not like GWTW at all....I think it's important to keep BOTH viewpoints in mind. Because both are very accurate, and both speak volumes about the meaning of \"Gone With The Wind\".",
            "I have enjoyed reading Gone with the Wind. I found the book in great shape.",
            "Gone With The Wind is a classic of mid-twentieth century epic fiction. I read it years after being misguided by Ayn Rand and I was stunned when I realized how closely Rand mimicked Mitchell's prose. Perhaps it was simply the writing style of the time. Mitchell and Rand differ, though, and if both writers create characters that are larger than life, Mitchell's are real while Rand's are pure fantasy.Scarlett O'Hara starts off as a prissy, selfish sixteen year old. She's in love with a beautiful wimp and can't stand losing him to a saintly rival. She marries someone else out of spite at her loss just as the Civil War begins. She's soon a widow and her estate is destroyed, her family in ruins. She marries again to a man with a sound business but no business sense. She takes over his lumber enterprise and gets thing done. She's again widowed and marries Rhett Butler, a man who has all her gumption but whose self interest is tempered by empathy for the aspirations and hopes of others.Scarlett is a fascinating character. She has gumption, she gets things done but has no compassion for anyone but herself. Yet she never wastes any time on recriminations when wronged or when she falls victim to someone else's mistakes; she just moves on to the next task. She has a sense of responsibility, in a way she doesn't clearly understand, and that there are things greater than herself. It is the tension between her inner contradictions that hooks the reader into admiration and that brings about our empathy for her.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo",
            "This is one of my most favorite books. Well-written and full of passion and fun. It's intimidating at first due to the length, but you won't want to put it down!",
            "I have read GWTW many times and have always longed for an adequate recording of this book. So, when I saw this book on CD at the library I checked it out. What a disappointment!I was so sure that a company with the stature of Recorded Books would select only the best narrator. This should have been given to Flo Gibson--someone with the vocal and acting chops to really do justice to both the narative and character portrayal.Just because someone can act well, it doesn't necessarily follow that she will be a great reader. This actor does, in all justice a fairly good job with Scarlett. However, her pacing and phrasing during the narrative portions was mediocre at best and GWTW has a lot of narrative. Secondary characters are not treated with much differentiation of vocal dynamics, expression or seemingly thought about character. The phrasing was particularly poor and down right irritating at times. It sounded as if this reader gave no preparation to some passages and sat down with the book to read aloud passages that she was seeing for the first time. I am really suprised that the editiors let this pass into publication.The only reason I gave it two stars is because the reader does an adequate job with Scarlett and seems to get the accent dead on. \"Reading\" this performance was so tedious that I did not finish the book. I certainly would not buy this performance. Read the book instead.",
            "I bought this vintage copy of \"Gone With the Wind\" for my friend's birthday. She has always loved this story and I wanted to get her as close to an original copy of the book as I could. She loved the book, its history, and of course this classic story.",
            "I love the movie, but the book is so much better. Beautiful edition, even the print is stylish. Reading it was pure pleasure - it took me over a year, as I was sparing the book. My wholehearted recommendation to anyone who loved the movie.",
            "I, TOO, am a literary snob. But I have to say, I had to go back again and read this much-loved book of my younger years -- well, only 5 years ago. But I relayed this heart-felt literary love of mine to my other great hardcover friends, Tawney and Marie (one, a long-time member of the illustrious Corduroy Club/Manhattan chapter), and they immediately nodded and tilted their heads at my cerebral connection to this masterpiece. I hope that we all, including myself (after countless other reads, good and bad, achievements and not so much of sad, downwardly-glanced works, but I digress) revisit this delightful glance at a telling of history that few these days pause to the written word. I commend my fellow apprecianados. Life - let it be lived.",
            "I never received this book, however this vendor made everything right and never argued with me over a refund. I was refunded 100% of the cost immediately. Thank you for holding up your end of the bargain on Amazon!",
            "This is my favorite novel of all time. It's much better than the movie, as is the case with most novels adapted for film. I didn't want it to end!",
            "After all these years, I never got around to reading the book, even after seeing the movie several times. Sorry I waited so long. This is one of the best books I have read. Truly how the South was...",
            "This product was definatly worth the few dollars I spent! I love classics esspecially the more historic ones and this book was in execent condition to be as old as it is.",
            "The book I received was in good shape. The seller shipped it very promptly and I received it within a week. It was packaged securely. I recommend this seller to anyone who runs across them. They are very professional.",
            "I've read Gone With The Wind several times over the years and I have always loved it. I loaded my copies out to people who never returned them to my dismay. So, I'm replacing these copies and intent to read again. Good quality of book.",
            "I loved this book! Scarlet is an authentic heroine- complicated and believable. I will remember more of the story of the Civil War from her story than I ever would from reading a history book. I lived in Georgia for about 4 years and the sense of state-pride was always sort of a mystery to me. Reading Gone with the Wind helped me to better understand the story of the civil war from the southern perspective and better understand the chivalrous culture still present today.",
            "I never tire of reading Gone with the Wind. I just preferred to read the hard back this time.",
            "It is hard to imagine anyone having the nerve to tackle a review of this book, as it is a classic and has already survived any review ever given to it. Suffice it to say that I read it the first time at 16, and it has remained my favorite book ever since. Written by a southerner who grew up on the stories, this novel will entertain and educate you about the Civil War, life on a plantation, and the courage to survive against all odds.",
            "It is a wonderful story...I love the different perspective of the civil war.It is also funny, witty, and well-written. One of the best love stories of all time.I was sorry to see it end, and although I haven't read the sequel, I am sure it can not do Margaret Mitchell's work justice. The only person who I think could write an adequate sequel is Margaret Mitchell herself.Gone With the Wind is definitely a five star novel.",
            "Like it or not-- and there are PLENTY of reasons not to like GWTW-- this book earns its status as a classic. It reminded me of Anna Karenina: well-written, brilliant &amp; deliciously soapy plot, and ultimately depressing. In the end, I was fed up with Rhett &amp; Scarlett, but I still cried for them.As a northerner living in the south, I got a new appreciation for/insight into the rich history of white southerners, but good luck finding any insight into the world of black southerners. True, Mitchell was a product of her times and one needs to allow for that, but she says some HORRIBLY insensitive things about black people.If you read this book, keep it in context. Remember that it is only one part of history, only one book, somewhere in the middle of truth and lies and legend.P.S.-- Zora Neale Hurston's &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot; would be an interesting book to read afterwards, especially if you need to restore your faith in true love.",
            "Haven't finished yet (300 pages left) but I'm loving this book... nothing horribly suspenseful happens yet I can't put it down. It's also easy to read- I never find myself thinking, &#34;Okay, let's get on with it&#34; as most people expect to do from books of this time period. It's very long (1037 pages) but don't let that deter you!",
            "This could/should be the book required in high school on the American Civil War and Reconstruction. It's also a romantic novel from a female's perspective, which is an interesting twist on a genre that traditionally has male heroes.",
            "When I first read Gone with the wind many years ago at age 25, I had watched the movie many times and loved it. Then when I read the book, I fell in love with it hailing it as the best book I'd ever read in my life. At that time though, I did find the in depth descriptions of the surroundings and of backgrounds of people a little tedious. Other than that, I loved it and my lifelong love of Civil War history was started right then and there. As the years went by and I read so many more books, a few years ago there began to be other books that took the title of \"best book\" in my eyes, always keeping that great love of GWTW in my heart. However, at age 52, I decided to read it again. It just called to me for some reason. This time, I loved it even so much more than I did then, and what I disliked about it years ago, the descriptive writing of Margaret Mitchell, is one of the things I loved about it most of all. It takes a tremendous amount of talent for a writer to totally immerse the reader into the setting they have created, when they can just see the lush beauty, the red clay, the desolation, the dying wounded, everything that was written, you lived it, smelled it, and felt it. I was in this story from beginning to end, and I lost myself in it completely. It now has rightfully taken its place as my favorite book of all time.Yes, It is a book where the main character is a selfish, spoiled rich plantation owner's daughter, that lost everything she had that she knew in the world, her home, her parents, many friends, her money, and how she clawed herself back to the top no matter who she ran over or hurt along the way. She is an unlikeable character that you cannot help but like anyway for the sheer will and determination she has to survive. Somewhere along that road of selfishness, she developed a conscience even though she stifled it whenever it reared it's head and went on being ruthless anyway. Also somewhere along the road, she realized that there was a feeling she could not quite identify in her heart about Melanie and Rhett, a feeling she did not realize was love until it was too late to enjoy that love. Oh you knew she was ruthless and hard, but you knew there was some good in her somewhere (was there?) and you rooted for her.Then there's Rhett. The rebellious, sarcastic, making money at the ruin of others, handsome man that fell in love with her the moment he cast eyes upon her. He was there for her so many times over the years, but she never really appreciated him. He loved her so much, but never let on in words that he did because he knew anyone that admitted they loved her, she would run over like she did so many other poor men that loved her, may they rest in peace. She realized she loved him much too late.There's Melanie, the mild, sweet shy girl-like woman who Scarlett said she hated because she was Ashley's wife (and of course Scarlett was in love with Ashley). So sweet and mild, she has a fierce loyalty and love for Scarlett, which Scarlett also didn't fully realize until it was too late.And Ashley, poor pitiful Ashley who she just thought she loved all these years only to finally realize she was In love with an idea of him, not him. She wasted all those years not realizing this, again, until it was too late.Mixing with all these wonderful characters and more, is a story about the south and how the world they knew was lost. Though it was a world that had many wrongs that should not have happened and that I'm glad was put an end, you can't help but feel their loss, feel the horror as they watched their houses and Atlanta burn to the ground. You feel their hungriness as they have nothing to eat, feel their shame as they have nothing but rags left to wear, feel their bitterness as they are under Yankee rule during the reconstruction.It's also a story about what different people do to survive. In this case, does one go with the flow and make the best out of a new situation and reap the benefits that they can in the situation they're in, or does one stay loyal to a cause that was burned to the ground and is no more and stay humbled and hungry? Does one sell their soul and prosper at the cost of others? Scarlett took advantage of the situation she was in and it made no difference who she ran over to do it or if she did forget the cause for which a war was fought. However, in the end, I think she realized that to have all she acquired, a very high price was paid for it all.This book was so great on so many levels, even more that what I've written here. For to go on, it would be way longer that this. I think it's a masterpiece.I do want to say one more thing, last but not least, about the author Margaret Mitchell. Though this was her only published novel, she did not drop down out of the sky to write this book out of nowhere. Growing up she wrote complete stories all the time as a little girl, was in drama at school, and as a young adult, worked as a journalist until she had to quit due to an ankle injury. She was born into a family rich in civil war history and many of her family had actually fought and lived during the civil war and she sat on many a lap listening to these stories throughout her childhood. She was born, lived and died in the city she wrote about, Atlanta. She knew of what she wrote about and it's historically accurate. She died, unfortunately, at the age of 48, hit by a drunk driver, crossing Peachtree St. (a street mentioned many times in the book), with her husband on the way to the movies. 5 days later she died, she was buried in Oakland Cemetary, (a graveyard mentioned in the book). To me, this book could have never been surpassed and I feel so good knowing that in her short life, she chose to leave this masterpiece for us all to enjoy forever. I, for one, am grateful. Thank you Margaret Mitchell.",
            "I have to say, at about 60-80 pages in, I was tempted to give up on this monstrous, 1000+ beast of a book, but Ifm glad I didnft. I have this strange compulsion to ALWAYS finish books, despite how bad they are in the beginning, in the hopes they get better. And this one certainly did.I wonft spend much time on plot, because truthfully, the only people that arenft aware of the basic plot of this book are those of you who were like me and obviously living under the largest rock in the world. Ifd like to start, instead, with Scarlett.Scarlett happens to be the most reprehensible, vile, and childish character Ifve ever encountered. And I love her. No matter how foolish I thought she was, I always wanted to read on to see what happened to her. I think this is where Mitchell really did something really wonderful. It is almost impossible to have complete disgust in a character and still want to know what her ending is. This is how I felt about Scarlett. I wanted to shake her until she developed some semblance of sense, but I then realized that this book has a sense of a bildungsroman to it. Yes, it is about life during the Civil War, and about romance, and many other things, but itfs mainly about Scarlett and her journey to womanhood. In my personal opinion, the interesting part is that she never really reaches that womanhood, despite all her hardships.I am not one for historical fiction. I will admit that I like historical war fiction even less. But although the novel is set during the time of the Civil War, and there are excerpts of the battles in it, I wasnft overwhelmed enough by it to dislike it. It was vaguely interesting to me, and didnft take away from the main story.I also wouldnft call this a romance, because, for all intents and purposes, Scarlett is never in love with anyone. She appears to be in love with Ashley throughout the entire book, and despite the many comments I may receive about this, I truthfully donft think she was ever in love with Rhett. I think she was in love with the idea of both of these men. The only person Scarlett is in love with is herself. And the only thing she is in love with is money. Which brings me to my next point: Mitchell took a huge risk making Scarlett the woman she did.Scarlett become a strong, independent, although still childish, woman. Her only gfallh is that she realizes she glovesh Rhett too late in the game, and has to (presumably) spend her life wanting him and never fully having him. Generally, when women of the 1800s are fictionalized as strong and independent, there are seriously negative connotations associated with them. You see this some with Scarlett, but she doesnft let it affect her. She is all in all strong. Silly in many regards, but strong. This is where Mitchell, in my opinion, really broke the mold. She allowed her character to suffer through so much pain and heartache and yet let her continue as an unbroken woman. Scarlett doesnft appear to be marred by anything but her own agenda. And I absolutely respect that, even though I still think she needs a bit more sense.I have to give this one s s s s. I truly loved it, with the exception of the lack of a love story. I guess in my head, I had considered this the greatest romance of all time (and I honestly couldnft tell you where I got this misperception), and I really found that lacking. Other than that, I would recommend this book to anyone who even remotely enjoys reading.If you enjoyed this review, come read others at [...]!",
            "The copy is a 1940's print, and is definitely used.I would have liked a bit more info in its cover condition, (It had parts of the original in a plastic protective sleeve) and the book was very musty.However, the pictures inside were beautiful and the book itself was in good condition.It made a wonderful present for my GWTW obsessed friend.Now to see if I can find myself a copy...",
            "this paper back book is 2 1/2 inches thick - I certainly have a lot of reading to do! Thanks!",
            "I received the book on time but the back cover was torn at the binding 1/2 way down! I was not impressed with that at all.",
            "I'M FINDING IT VERY HARD TO KEEP READING THE BOOK. I EXPECTED IT TO BE EVEN BETTER THAN THE MOVIE; BUT SO FAR, I'M STRUGGLING TO KEEP READING",
            "I am just really getting started reading Gone With The Wind, so don't feel I have a real handle on the story as of yet. It is good enough to keep me reading and not lose interest.",
            "i just finished Gone With the Wind, and i love it. although it is heart-breaking, it's romantic and full of emotions. i like how the characters were develped; they all have their own traits. anyone who likes romance or has a lot of patience, i suggest you to read this book. (remember, you might cry like a baby when you finsih the book cuz it's........read it, and you'll know what i mean.)",
            "This book moved me because it was full of spontaneous adventure and valuable lessons. Margrett Mitchell not only wrote on romance and love, but also on the very real issues of a woman's place, jealousy, loyalty, and respect. Scarlett is the ideal stong and independent woman. She did not need men for their money and protection; she needed them for more suitable reasons like love and comfort. The entire novel was a lovely and inspiring story with twists of all kinds. I would highly recommend it to anyone in need of a wonderful read.",
            "Having lost count of how many times I have read Gone With the Wind, I continue to come back to it as, by far, my favorite book. Margaret Mitchell creates characters so vividly they seem real and sets them in a period of American history, the Civil War, that many of us are familiar with but from a perspective few can relate to, namely that of the Southern plantation family. It's very easy to create a vivid image of the characters, the context, the time in history, and how these factors mesh together to create situations that Scarlett O'hara can stuggle through and flourish in. Mitchell's creation of such characters as Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler allow you to question what exactly right and wrong really mean. These characters are selfish and crude, and reak of something, but throughout the book they continuously do extraordinary things for others. If you are in anyway a fan of historical novels, this is a must read.",
            "I thought the book was very good. I could not put it down. I absolutly hated the ending though. I wish I wouldn't of read the last.....150 pages. Oh well. I thought it was great anyway!!!",
            "I first read Gone With the Wind when I was fifteen . I read it again at twenty and have read it several times since. I am now forty years old and have read thousands of books and this book was and still is my all time favourite. there has never been a book so captivating , so romantic, so rebellious, so true to the south. Scarlett and Rhetts relationship is so full of fireworks it leaves the reader eagerly turning the page to see whats going to happen next. When I started a collection of all time classic books it was the first one I put on the bookshelf. I hope every young reader gets the chance to this fabulous novel.",
            "When Margret Mitchell wrote Gone With The Wind she probably never realized what an amazing story she began. The book combines romance with adventure. Scarlett O'Hara will always be remembered as one of the greatest characters of all time for her Irish ways and charming beauty.",
            "I read this book three years ago, but I couldn't help but write this review now. This book goes far beyond what humanly words can possibly say. This book sparked so many emotions in me, I thought I would die. Even at a few hundred pages left to experience, I was aching because it was coming to a close so fast. I can't count the number of times I cried, and how long I cried at the end. I didn't want to let go of the enchanting story, but I could never, ever read it again. This book truly touched me, and I'm saddened by the loss of this magnificent author. There'll never be another. God Bless You Miss Mitchell.",
            "Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind is my absolute favorite book. I enjoy books that have deeper meaning and make you think, but although this book lacks one it's a masterpiece all the same. Read it for the story and lose yourself in the Old South. P.S. The movie was great, but the book goes into much more detail and causes one to be much more drawn to the heroine.",
            "This awesome book takes the reader back to the 1800s and the Civil war era. Its main characters include Scarlett O'Hara Hamilton Kennedy Butler, from whose point of view the story is told, the charming and fickle Rhett Butler, Ashley Wilkes, the object of Scarlett's affection, and his wife, Melly. I say, if you read only one book in your life, this should be it!",
            "Margaret Mitchell's characters are very real and life like. Scarlett is never portrayed as perfect. Rather, the change from the young belle of Tara to the poverty-stricken lumber dealer and then to a lady sitting on a mountain of wealth shows her faults. The infamous Captain Rhett Butler always finds Scarlett. As her hatred for him increases, the more the reader sees the love between them that she is blind to. There is so much in the book that the movie doesn't include. I'm glad it is so long, for it brings longer enjoyment.",
            "This is undoubtably one of the greatest, most gripping stories ever written. At first it's hard to get into, but- once Scarlett makes up her mind there's no stopping her and the adventure starts. Charles and Melly Hamilton, Ashley Wilkes, Aunt Pittypat and most of all Rhett Butler send Scarlett flying into confusion. With the war raging all around her, trying to support her family and friends, and trying to understand Rhett, Scarlett lives through a time of hardships and scorn, and bears it stubbornly. This book was gripping to the end, and left me thinking &quot;What happens next? You have to tell me! I just have to know!&quot; I am definitely going to read the sequel to this. Anyone who likes thrilling advinture, romance, and fiery heroines will love this book.",
            "This book is for those people who can't stand when a good book to come to an end. Also for those who like romance and loved the movie. You don't have to have seen the movie though to enjoy the book.",
            "I can't help admiring! The greatest creation of gifted author. Characters are picted so vividly! Scarlett seems nothing but spoilt chiled, and Rhett is a real Man, real Gentlemen - one you can trust. They live though Civil War, they learn to love, understand and forgive each other. I've read this book about 20 times and now I am looking for any chance to read it in English. Don&quot;t you think now that it is worth reading?",
            "I have read this book twice and each time it's as if I'm reading it for the first time. I loved both the book and the movie. The story is very passionate and expresses the powers of love. Rhett is the kind of person any woman wouldn't mind being married to.",
            "My mother read this book when she was 13. I read it when I was 13. I don't have a daughter, but if I did, I'd surely present her with a copy of this when she reached &quot;the age&quot;. Has your daughter read it? Don't settle for just the movie (although that's wonderful, too)! Read it!",
            "Truly amazing. I have read and reread this book several times. It never fails to amaze me how brilliantly Scarlett O'Hara is portrayed. And how such a spoiled brat could become so endeared by millions, including me. A first-rate love story that follows birth, death, and the horrid destruction of war. Please read this book, and cry for a lost civilization - the south.",
            "As this quote from the opening of the movie says, &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is a novel which truly brings us back to a different time, a time of southern gentlemen and hoop-skirted women. But if you've only seen the movie, you've only seen half the story. The novel describes the life of Scarlett O'Hara, southern belle, in much greater detail, and paints a vivid portrait of life and love in the Old South, and of the Civil War which destroyed it. This is an inspiring tale -- Scarlett is a strong-willed woman who faces the horrors of war and survives, rebuilding her life from nothing. &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is a wonderful story masterfully written. It truly gives us an insight into, as the movie says, &quot;a dream remembered, a civilization Gone With the Wind&quot;.",
            "I love &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;. When I was 14 my mother handed me the book and said it was the best book she had ever read. I looked at the size of the book and thought there was no way I would ever get through it. One day I began reading and I just couldn't stop. I was sad when I had finished it and asked myself the same question everyone does; what happend next? I gave the book to my best friend. She thought I was stupid, but since she had nothing better to do she read it. She soon learned I really wasn't stupid.",
            "Margaret Mitchell's epic novel &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; defies all ratings. It deserves far more than a mere ten. I read this book when I was 13 years old, and discovered the most unforgettable story with the most vibrant, LIVING characters ever written. To me, Scarlett O'Hara, Rhett Butler, Melanie Wilkes, and all the others are truly real people. The movie &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; is undoubtedly the greatest film ever made, which it could hardly help being with such a story to work from. This book can and should be read by anyone who loves to read, because it is simply too good to miss.",
            "This book is possibly the greatest piece of literature I have ever set my eyes upon. Although it took me about two weeks to read it, I lived through a decade of history and watched as Scarlett O'Hara struggled against and won over every adversity in the midst of the Civil War. I felt as though I were right there watching as the drama played out before me. Never before have I had such a complete and accurate view of history and been fooled so completely into thinking that characters on the page were real people that actually lived. If one does not read this book, then it is a complete loss to him or her for they have passed up the chance to experience, rather than read, a book",
            "It's an ok story until after the war and then how they turn on the poor old masters and blah, blah, blah... pure southern womanhood all a-fearin' them free black men going around crazy raping... oh come on Margaret, where did you do your research?Just too much of it... and I'm not really so sure Scarlet is so bad, she seems the only one capable of doing the work it takes to get the whole family out of all the scrapes they are in... so what's wrong with that???Well, must consider when it was written I suppose... next I'm reading &#34;Uncle Tom's Cabin&#34; to get the bad taste out of my mouth.",

            "Just finished this story. Took a while. Glad I didn't live in that period. Now I know what all that dreadful war was about. I didn't know anything about it but now I am full up to the top! I have not read anything quite like this novel which took me weeks to read, and I thank my lucky stars I am me, living in a tiny country where people don't go mad. The sheer volume of words describing conflict, emotions, deprivation and loss was unbelievable. If you want to tuck up on a rainy day (or days) and learn what it was like to live in that century then this is the book for you. Scarlett needed a good smack, Rhett needed a good hug, Pittypat needed a box of tissues, Ashley needed a ramrod for his spine and Melly needed a sainthood. Yes, I understood what was written about the war, and loathed it, but isn't that what a story is supposed to do? Wring out your feelings? And I certainly am wrung out. This book gives you more buck for your dollar than many I have read, so go on - put your feet up and get stuck in to Gone with the Wind. Makes you feel grateful for what you have.",

            "One of the greatest american epic stories of all time and one of the only books to ever be correctly adapted to the silver screen. Scarlet is a wonderful character as is Rhett. The only thing you could wish for is a slightly better ending.",
            "Believe it or not, the book is better than the film -- more historical insight and background.",
            "Some books you love and you forget the characters after a few days. Some books you love and the characters stay with you forever - Gone With The Wind is one of these books!",
            "When I first read this book a year ago, I fell in love with it.i really enjoyed everything about this book. I cant tell you witch parts i like more.This is the type of book that should be read by everybody!",
            "I loved this book. It is a classic and everyone should read it! The sequel is also a must read!",
            "This book is absolutely the best. You would have to be a fool not to enjoy this book. It is beautifully written, and extremely enjoyable. Its length is an excellent support, for if you are hungry for more, it is always coming. READ THIS BOOK AND YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPOINTED!",
            "I picked up this book from the library when I was only 11. Every time I read a book I have a new fave book,but this book is my very favorite. Scarlett O'Hara may be an absolute brat, but I love her. She's got spunk and sprit!Melanie is such a sweet charachter! Rhett is imposible, but hysericaly funny! This book takes you through 12 years of Scarlett's life. It is funny, touching, and very real. When I read this book, I laughed,pondered over certain ideas, and cried. This is an iresistible romance, which teaches leasons about life and love. I recomended this book to any one!",
            "This book is a very interesting one. Me being 14 years old, I didn't think I was going to like it at all because I'm not the fondest person of reading. But I found it very interesting, and easy to follow most of the time. It took me back to the time of the Civil War, and I felt I was actually there. I would recommand this book to amyone. Especially ones that are interested in Historical-Ficiton.",
            "Scarlett O'Hara is the ultimate survivor. She has more inner strength and passion than any man or woman in the story except, of course, for Rhett Butler. &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; is the kind of book that you don't just read; you actually live the story, and when you finish reading the last page, you are bereft because you miss the characters so much. The characters are so clearly defined you feel that you know them. The story of the finely detailed lives of every single character, told against the background of some of the most romantic, disburbing, and turbulent years of American history, is unparalled. It is a great tribute to Margaret Mitchell that her only published work is loved and revered by so many. Anyone who thinks he knows the story of &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; from seeing the movie is sadly mistaken. This story MUST BE READ to be truly appreciated!",
            "I not only have one dog earred copy of this book, I have two dog earred copies of this book on my nightstand. What a great book! Inspiring, thoughtful and interesting all at that same time. Yes, there are racist elements and sterotypical themes (the use of the \"n\" word is discusting and offensive and the view that the slaves were \"Happy\" was absolutely discusting). The issue of slavery was sugar-coated - the slaves were never depicted as being human beings with thoughts and feelings - they were just charactures meant to serve their Caucasian \"masters\". I enjoyed reading about the historical aspect of the Civil War. The characters of Scarlett and Rhett do not pretend to be something they are not - both are shrewd, focused, fiesty. Is Scarlett a spoiled little brat? Yes, of course she is, but somehow the author makes you want to root for her in the end because Scarlett fights for what she wants and never gives up. I think those are admirable qualities for any person to have.I agree with other posts that there was no reason for a sequel(s). The sequel really served no purpose other than to confirm what (most) of us already knew or hoped - that Scarlett and Rhett would end up together anyway.",
            "I think everyone either loves or hates this book-so here I'm just going to say that I love this book, and I really believe it is one of the finest novels ever written. Yes, it portrays black slaves as their owners saw them in the Civil war-as inferior people. But would it really have been historical fiction if it had been any other way? This is not just a novel about Scarlet and Rhett Butler-this is a book about the pre-civil war way of life in the South and the way the real southerners, the ones who lost their slaves and plantations and had to make a major adjustment on their viewpoints on race, lived. Scarlet and Rhett and Melony and Ashley-they are some of the best written characters ever created. And no, you shouldn't be able to understand their mindset. They lived a hundred and fifty years ago and no one today has a mindset like that. Good historical fiction should always put you in a mindset that it hard to understand and relate to-because otherwise it's just a character in the past with a modern mindset.Read this book if you want to know true history. The way the war is portrayed is gruesome and terrible, but like a car wreck you can't look away. The writing shows the true effect it has on the lives it touched and the horrible way it changed and damaged all the people who lived through it. It is fascinating, impeccably written as far as the historical facts go, and also romantic and enjoyable. I read this book every year and every time I love it. If you like historical fiction, read this book. If you like history, read this book. Even if you think this book is raciest and terrible, read the book. Understand a different viewpoint on history.Besides, the author was not a raciest at all. This is FICTION folks.This is the ultimate historical fiction, and every one should read it. From page one you will be trapped.So much more than five stars.",
            "Having just watched the movie recently after many years, I realized anew how wonderful the book is in comparison! Scarlett is more than just a money-hungry b****, Rhett is *much* more than the wimp who kept telling her he loved her in the movie, etc.I love GWTW because it's one of the few books that remains true to its characters. A happy ending was never possible for Rhett and Scarlett, because she saw him as more scoundrel than soul mate until the very end. He put up with *more* than enough from her before his love gave out, and he hid that love from her except on two memorable occasions.This is an interesting portrait of the South, and in turn, of Marget Mitchell herself. The racism in this novel never bothered me, because she was simply seeing life through the filter of her own life and experiences. Things were so different back then; how can anyone judge from today's perspective?I'd recommend this book to anyone. I read it first when I was 11 years old, but so much of the adult content and nuances went over my head that I wouldn't recommend this to children.",
            "Gone With The Wind is no doubt THE classic Civil War novel. However, the major characteristic that enables it to achieve its greatness also condemns Scarlet to a life of unrequited love and dooms her potential for happiness with Rhett. That attribute is that it is written entirely from the woman's viewpoint.The perspective is a strength because it permits the author to vividly portray the destruction of Southern society better than any battlefield-centered novel could. Regrettably, it also leaves the author, and therefore Scarlet as well, incapable of understanding the male characters. They are merely personalities that fade in-and-out of the background to shape the narrative. While they are characters that can stand up off the page and cast a shadow, there is no tone or timbre in their images.For example, Rhett notes that he was nearly killed stealing the horse to get Scarlet out of Atlanta before it was burned. But Mitchell does not describe the theft. Therefore, Scarlet (and Mitchell herself) cannot appreciate Rhett's ordeal or gain true insight into his character.In another instance the novel mentions that Rhett fought at the battle of Franklin. What Mitchell does NOT tell the reader is that Franklin was probably the bloodiest defeat of a Confederate army in the entire war. For Southern arms its horrors are unmatched by any of the better known battles in Virginia or elsewhere. Mitchell fails to narrate this experience and thereby misses yet another opportunity understand and appreciate Rhett.In short, since Mitchell herself failed to share much of Rhett's (or any man's) experiences, the chances that Scarlet could find true love were as slim as an Apache Indian getting elected Pope. Mitchell and Scarlet sought only to be understood and not to understand.",
            "This classic Civil War-era romance novel won the Pulitze Prize in 1937 and was made into the classic movie audiences around the world know and love two years later. This terrific saga begins before the Civil War (which the Union won four years later, paving the way for the 14th Amendment, which ended slavery in 1865, several months after Abraham Lincoln's assassination) and ends during Reconstruction. I won't go over the plot again, as many who've either read the book or seen the movie (or both) know what it's about. Those who haven't read it, read the editor's reviews. One major difference between the book and the movie is that the book has a lot of cursing and the movie only has one swear word: \"Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn.\" The way Rhett (Clark Gable, who won Best Actor in 1934 for the delightful screwball comedy \"It Happened One Night\"; review coming soon) says that to Scarlett (Vivien Leigh, in the role that won her her 1st Academy Award for Best Actress; the 2nd one was also for Best Actress in \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" in 1954) makes it seem like it's not a bad word at all. Watch the movie AFTER reading the book, you'll appreciate it more. The book is rated PG-13 for intense thematic elements, strong vulgar language, mild war violence, some images of wounded, violence, intense domestic conflict, mild sensuality and brief nudity. The movie is rated G.SCARLETTEveryone expected a sequel to \"Gone With The Wind,\" but those hopes went up in smoke when Margaret Mitchell died in 1939, the same year the classic movie (see my review on it) came out and three years after it was published. Imagine how surprised I was when I found out about the sequel, advertised on the back cover of the Large Print Edition that I borrowed countless times from my local library before buying it from \"Doubleday Book Club\" (rarely do they have anything worth buying). Alexandra Ripley (who is she?) wrote this follow-up with the \"Permission\" of the Mitchell Estate and look at the result. True, the story picks up where the original left off, but a twist of the supernatural (what the hell was she thinking?!!) just ruined the novel. It too was turned into a movie starring Joanna W.-Kilmer and Timothy Dalton (two-time James Bond in \"The Living Daylights\" and \"Licence To Kill\" [see my reviews on them]), which I don't know if it's any good. Ripley got some things right (adding more backstory to Rhett, etc), but she completely missed the mark on others (killing Mammy off, what the devil were you on, cocaine?) It's good reading if you want to find out what happens between Rhett and Scarlett, one of the most famous love affairs in literature, but if you expect the sequel to be as good as the original, don't bother. The novel is rated PG for some violence, mild language and brief nudity.GONE WITH THE WIND:5 starsSCARLETT:2/1/2 stars",
            "(that is if it takes 6 weeks to read... so you better start reading!!!)In a word... you will RELIVE Scarlett's experience and she will become a person to you :) If you are a person who likes drama and human emotion, then this is the book for you! The fact that it is set against the chaotic background of the American Civil War is just an added bonus since the real storyline of the book is the tale of a woman's struggle against time and change when her world is falling apart.",
            "This book is captivating from the start.The characters are so real.They aren't all good and Scarlett is a horrible person.That fact only makes you like her more.The ending of this book left me wanting more.That is why I can't wait to read the sequal.Gone With The Wind is a classic and anyone who hasn't read it is missing out.",
            "This book is my favorite. I have read it straight through a few numerous times, but my favorite thing to do is just pick it up and let the pages fall open. It's the kind of book you can do that with. I love the emotion the characters show, and especially what they hide, waiting for you to find out. The vitality of the Old South meeting with the views of one courageous woman and those both behing her and against her is amazing. Scarlett O'Hara , Rhett Butler, and the others are characters never to be forgotten, immortalized forever by Margaret Mitchell.",
            "GWTW has many flaws -- the political views of the book can be most kindly described as &quot;naive,&quot; and its racism is apparent on virtually every page. The second half of the book feels rushed; once Mitchell has actually united Scarlett and Rhett, she no longer seems to write them with the same imagination and humor. All that said, this is the quintessential blockbuster -- not a deep book by any means, but entertaining in ways most novels or movies could never dream of being. Mitchell has a gift of creating fantastical situations for her characters -- and making them seem not only believable but unevitable. The characterization is stronger than is generally realized; Scarlett, Rhett, and Ashley all have layers of complexity that far more &quot;literary&quot; novels often fail to create. It's part of pop culture, and American culture, and for all its flaws and frustrations, an endlessly enjoyable and memorable read.",
            "some people should just shut their mouths. Gone with the Wind was the best book ever written!!! I read it in a week when i was fifteen and fell in love. I had seen the movie seven times before i had read the book. After i read the book though, i became completely obsessed with Gone With the wind, i bought the book and the movie, and have been hunting for any pictures, quotes and reviews. Gone With the Wind- it's not only one of the best books i have ever read, it's an obsession, it's my life.By the way, to those who thought that Gone with the Wind was a ridiculous read because of the length, they can go and get a brain. Good books have a lot of depth to them, and they need all the extra pages they can get. Gone With the Wind is not all about trash, as an underimaginative few found it. It's not only an overdramatic love story, it's not only another one of those American civil war stories. It's really about the complexity of human emotions, feelings, and the way people handle obstacles and life,consequences of actions and emotions and also about certain people and their mutual understanding of each other. When i finished GWTW for the very first time, i continued to think about the extra depth in that book which i just couldn't understand. I read the book several times more, and also began reading in between the lines. In the end i discovered that Magaret Mitchell was an absolute genius. She was no where near the trashy romance writer many had portrayed her to be- she was a realist. She was actually writing about how human spirit and determination, how it can be applied to help one over such obstacles. For those who say there was no depth to gwtw ought to read the book again. Perhaps they read the book to fast for their own benefits, it's such a shame because it only denotes what shallow and uneducated people they are, not being able to understand truly what an amazing conquest Margaret Mitchell had achieved.",
            "There aren't words... I have no idea what took me so long to read this book. Now that I have it will never leave me.",
            "Scarlett remains my favorite heroine of all the thousands of books I've ever read. I just reread the novel and still found it to be one of the best books ever. Timeless",
            "Big oops to whomever fixed this up for a kindle. There is a few missing sentences here and there scattered through this book.Therefore I cannot in good conscience give 5 stars for a favorite book of mine, as I (really) have read this over 30 different times. My first copy I was given as a christmas gift in 1976 and it took me 5 days from start to finish.and that particular copy can open like a fan while laid on it's spine. !!Over the years I have ended up re-purchasing the book due to my current copy getting battered and falling apart. So...I have several copies of this book. And when I saw I could get it on kindle I was super excited thinking that I wouldn't need to purchase this in paperback/hardcover again.Well, I'm reading the section where Ashley is on furlough and as I am reading along I realize that there is a missing sentence in that section, so I grab my hardcover and sure enough the Fontaine brothers sentence is missing in the kindle edition. I have decided to read the kindle and hardcover at the same time and compare as I go along because I feel that if one sentence is missing is there other sentences missing ? M. Mitchell wrote every sentence with a purpose and it's a disservice to this wonderful book that it's not all , and I mean all, in this kindle book. Please please correct this , not just for this book but for all kindle books.",
            "This is one of my favorite books that I could read over and over again. I love everything about it, the plot, the inner fights of the characters, the realistic description of the Civil war events, all put together in a beautiful story that you will not be able to forget.",
            "Read this in the early 1960's, named my children Ashlie, Melanie, Rhett & Katie Scarlett, so loved it then, love it still.",
            "I finally had the time to read this wonderful book! Wordy, long and descriptive, just what I enjoy in a good read. I know I will read it again and again! A true classic!",
            "This is one of those books where you find a little bit of yourself in each character, rather than finding one you can entirely associate with. It's imposible to completely like or completely hate any of the characters.There are many reasons I can't bring myself to read any of the liscenced or unofficial sequels to this book:1)This book was written about 73 years after the time setting of the book itself, & when the author was born in 1700, Having read books from that time, like Baum's Oz series, culture of the late 19tch century & early 20th century were more similar than the 1900s are from now, so she wouldn't have had to do nearly as much research on life in the Confederate South as a sequel writer would, & a sequal writer younger than herself would have their cultural views skewed by the changes of modern times.2)It doesn't really need a sequel. If you think about what direction the story might have gone in if Rhett didn't leave Scarlet; They were incapable of being happy together it might have had the same kind of tragic ending as Warren Adler's \"War of the Roses.\" Or since Scarlet is such a proud woman who has been married to many men she didn't love, she might return from Tara & decide to divorce Rhett upon his promised occasional returns & marry the childish Ashley just to kick Rhett in the side for abandoning her. Or she could have gone another 5 or 10 years persuing Rhett only to loose interest in him when she finally won him back; like she looses interest in anything else when the hunt is over.I recommend \"War of the Roses,\" as well as Jane Austin's \"Pride & Prejudice,\" as I find similarity in their rough relationship as well.",
            "I think that Gone with the wind is the best book ever written the movie is a winner to . I love how it informs you of everything that is going on. You go through the whole book like will Scarlett and Redett get together or will they stay together will Scarlett finally get Ashely. Will they survive the war. Who will live and who will die. You read through the tragides and the good times . I give Gone with the Wind and will argue with anyone who differs.",
            "Thinking of this book, it's hard to avoid a real feeling of sadness. Unfortunately, many people know NOTHING about post- Civil War Reconstruction besides what they read in GWTW and saw in the 1939 movie. Everything from both sources that relates to the Reconstruction era is wrong-- and yes, I do mean EVERYTHING. America reached a peak of racial harmony in those years that in many ways it has yet to reattain. It was an era of honest, integrated government, integrated education, integrated workplaces, and so much more. Many, many white people, including Southerners and former Confederates, were able to lay their racism aside to an astonishing degree and attempt to rebuild a new South. It was a shining, extraordinary period of our nation's history. Too bad few people know anything accurate about it, and instead get totally incorrect information from sources like GWTW!",
            "The cover of this book appealed to me more than the classic, hardback and so I purchased it instead just a few weeks ago. The book arrived on time and everything appeared to be in perfect condition. However, the old adage, \"You can't judge a book by it's cover\" must be very true, indeed, considering that at least two pages are missing and that one is replaced with a later page.With that aside, being that I am an avid reader, I'm almost ashamed to admit that I have not read this book until recently and fortunately, I wasn't succumbed to it despite all of the cult-like adoration it receives. Besides Margret Mitchell's writing being possibly the best I think I've ever come across; passionate descriptions, believable characters and dialogue, etc.,GWTW is filled with anti-equality, anti-Republican, hate speech that is impossible to ignore, and the book could have easily been shortened by at least 300 pages. Though Mitchell's writing style was obviously brilliant, she tended to delve too far into trivial details concerning things that were utterly pointless in my opinion.I agree wholeheartedly with another reviewer that Ms. Mitchell would possibly have an extremely difficult time getting her book published today.",

            "I...wasted about two months reading this book. I STARTED reading it because it is so talked about I figured I should. I came to the conclusion that I should spend my time reading books I find entertaining. I don't see how anyone could possibly find this book entertaining. The three stars I gave it are because it is a well written book, and I figure, hey any book with this kind of a reputation deserves something. One note, what about this son of Rhett's? Did Margaret Mitchell just forget to tell us the background on him? Obviously there is a big story behind that...all I can figure is that he is the child of Belle Watling, as the book never really did say why he got involved with her in the first place. I dont feel like reading a sequel that wasnt even written by Margaret Mitchell to find out what happens... Anyway, a well written book and I accomplished my purpose...to be able to say that I have read Gone With the Wind. Other than that I didn't get a whole heck of a lot out of it.",
            "Gone With the Wind is one of my favorite novels, and I previously owned it only in paperback, so purchased this hardback just over a year ago. I read it after purchasing it, and then it went on a bookshelf. When I brought it back down to let my daughter read it, she commented that the pages were coming out, and sure enough they were. The glue in the binding has lost all of its stickiness and the pages are all completely coming out. What a HUGE disappointment after the money spent. I was better off with my paperback. Do NOT buy this format of the book.",
            "I was one of those who disappeared for a few days until I finished the book. A great, spellbinding novel. With that said, the history in the book is terrible. This is such a warped perspective on slavery; it is history through the eyes of Simon LeGree. We are supposed to believe that the slaves really loved \"Massa\", instead of being kept in place by the lash, the chain, and the gun. Further, the Reconstruction governments in the South did some great things. The South has done an excellent job of rewriting history to make themselves look good. This novel is unfortunately the basis for many people's view of history of these times. We are supposed to feel bad that the \"glorious\" days of the slave plantation are \"gone with the wind.\"",
            "I am sorry , but I did not like Gone With The Wind(I am a senior in highschool and despite what everyone thinks about highschoolers, I am well read. And I have read books by James A Michener and John Jakes). I will admit that Scarlett has an amazing ability to survive, but it is only by her own selfishness that she does. I would rather read a different book about the civil war that contains better people than Scarlett. I feel sorry for the men that fall in love with Scarlett and I feel sorry for Scarlett because the one man she loves is lost to her. I do not believe in pining after something one cannot have, it wastes a lot of time and is too much wasted emotion. Even though I do not like Scarlett, I do appreciate the facts that Mitchell worked in about the civil war, such as the burning of Atlanta and what happened when the former slaves were given the right to vote and hold office. All in all, Gone With The Wind is an O.K. book, if you do not mind inconclusive endings and selfish people.",
            "My father browbeat me into reading Gone With The Wind when I was a teenager. To this day I can't understand what all the fuss was about. Scarlet is such a spoilt snit that I couldn't care what happened to her. I guess this is one book you either love or hate, so I recommend that you check a volume out of the library and read a chapter or two. If you hate it, you've lost nothing but a little of your time. If you love it, well, there's no accounting for taste.",

            "I have just re-read GWTW for the fourth time and each timeI do I start out thinking it a magnificently written and researched book, with a glorious story - and the patronizing racist attitude of the author - yes, the author herself - makes me sick to my stomach.I devoured this novel when I was thirteen, again in my twenties, then my thirties, and here I am again, keen to know what will happen next to that sociopath Scarlett O'Hara the ultimate sexy, manly man, Rhett Butler and the dreamy dreamer and weakling, Ashley Wilkes.And yet - I believe this book should be banned. There are almost no books I feel that way about. I'm a writer and I abhor censorship. But this book is so outright racist it gags.Why should such stereotypes be allowed to continue for generation after generation to absorb?What would the world think of a romantic novel about dashing German SS officers and a beautiful blonde \"maidchen\" cavorting charmingly before concentration camp slaves? All the while talking about those slaves as if they were simply \"children\" who didn't know any better than to be wearing striped pajamas, carrying out humiliating tasks for their \"masters\" and existing pleasantly and contentedly in their cute little \"barracks\"? Critics would be up in arms. Such a novel would fall into disrepute and no one would claim it to be a great work of literature, even if it was well-written. So why do we stand for GWTW - this travesty of lies, lies, lies?I notice that one of the reviewers below mentioned that slaves weren't, in fact, badly treated. Hello! To begin with, slavery is slavery: an abomination upon the Earth. Any person who is enslaved is being treated badly. Period. Second, that reviewer should read Toni Morrison's \"Beloved\"to find out what it was REALLY like to live as a slave on a southern plantation. That depiction rings true. GWTW, on the subject of slavery, is complete clap-trap.Over and over again, it is mentioned that Scarlett's mother, \"Miss Ellen,\" would be \"turning over in her grave\" to see howScarlett betrayed her southern belle roots. Well, I contend that Margaret Mitchell is turning over in her grave because she knows what a monstrous mistake she made with GWTW. Hopefully, she's evolved, and, knowing her feminist views and her basic fairness as a person, I think she would agree with me - BAN THIS BOOK!",

            "I first read Gone With the Wind when I was 16 which was more than 50 years ago if you must know. I have always loved the book and the movie. I was in the hospital for a while last year and knew that I would have a lengthy recovery after I got home, so I bought this edition for my Kindle and read a chapter or two every night and it really helped to know it was there at the end of my day. I read it leisurely and loved it once again.I know there are several versions, or editions, for the Kindle, and I don't know about the others, but this one was recommended and it was perfect.",
            "GWTW is one of the best books ever written. Mrs. Mitchell really captured the whole Cival War theme and added a ruthless heroine to the amazing plot to make it even MORE addictive. It tells the story of a woman with gumption, as she called it, spirit, pride, and an everlonging love for Ashley Wilkes. People say it is a racist and sexist book but, in truth, the opinions and views of the characters were how the Southerners thought in the Old South. She wrote about a dream and a mystery that did not survive but was the setting of a love so passionate and endearing that it cannot be described. It told the tale of Knights and their Ladies Fair, of master and of slave. I, personally, thought that the sequel was just as good but it did not give Scarlett the same ruthless qualities. But we must cut Mrs. Ripley some slack, it would be nearly impossible to equal a book as great as GWTW. The plot and characters were simply amazing. Scarlett, the conniving and strong woman that the book focuses on. Rhett, the lover and third husband to Mrs. O'Hara who loved Scarlett so much that it was almost unreal. Melanie Wilkes, the only true friend to Scarlett who was a true gentlewoman with a sense of polite gumption. And then there was Ashley Wilkes, the poor soul that was crushed when the war ended and a person who loved Scarlett dearly but could not and would not abandon his wife and child for society honor. These were the characters that sculpted the greatest love story ever told. It was a Civilization GONE WITH THE WIND.",
            "Fast shipment!!! Great Product! Can't wait to watch the movie again. I wanted this for a keepsake in case it went out of print!",
            "I was very please with the quality of the book and the speed of service. There was a mix up on the original order but was correct in a very timely manner and at no additional expense to me.",
            "The story is fabulous - as far as I could read. Pages 672 to 705 were missing but 705 to 736 were inserted twice. Apparently a problem on the assembly line! So I'm off to the library to read the missing pages.",
            "This epic tale of Georgia during and after the Civil war is quite possibly one of the best literary works I've ever read. It is powerful and filled with completely three dimensional characters. It follows the struggles of Scarlett O'Hara through the harsh realities that women faced during the war and the determination not to starve and to rebuild her life after the fighting ended. Scarlett is a very strong woman-forthright and levelheaded and stubbornly practical. She is a product of the hardships she had to overcome in order to keep her family and herself alive. No, she isn't a likeable character. But it is her flaws that make her endearing. Melanie is a perfect angel and my favorite character. She seems weak on the surface, but she is the foundation for everyone around her. It is her quiet strength that helps everyone stand on their own two feet. You can't help but love her. This book will live in my mind for a long time. I'm so glad to have read it.",
            "Addressing the complexities between a man and a woman, this great American classic \"Gone with The Wind\", which takes place during the Civil War when the South was badly destroyed and crippled, comes to mind. There is really nothing that this reviewer can think of to match the intensity and dynamics between a temperamentally-suited couple such as Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler. The author, Margaret Mitchell, whose own life story is extremely interesting, leaves us at the end of her magnificent saga to determine in the mind of Scarlett as perhaps those of other readers, whether she is going to be resigned to a life of long regrets, or forge ahead 'Tomorrow' in search of her true love. A brilliant portrayal of war and passion between a man and a woman as Old Dixie goes up in flames. One of the best and enduring American love stories ever, Margaret Mitchell hailing from the South, wrote from her heart and about what she knew at the time while never pretending to be an intellect or an historian. And, to think that a vexed Mitchell would not have agreed to make such a splendid contribution to American literature if a friend of hers had not been overheard saying: 'Peggy is too silly to write a book!'.",

            "Michell's mammoth novel is given a wonderful treatment by Heritage (the set is designed by Ted Gensamer.)2 Volumes in 2 slipcases in two-cloth bindings of cream and green. Gold print to the spines with magnolia decorations; image of young Scarlet to the front cover in gold. Sewn bindings. 5.5 pounds.John Groth illustatrations: something like ten color illustrations per volume, some half page and a few two-page spreads. There are also about 30 b&w; pen and ink illustrations per volume. The text is laid out in double columns which means that the books are readable -- not too heavy in the hand -- but still easy on the eye. Groth's images are definitely influenced by the film but he's interested in the characters in the novel rather than the actors in the movie.All in all, a deluxe yet classy piece of work.",
            "I read this book for the first time when I was 14 and I havebeen in love with it ever since. Scarlett was desperate for love, butwas looking in all the wrong places. She loved Rhett, but was too determined to make it in the world without him in an era that frowned on women behaving in that manner. In the end, she only defeated her own purpose; she had plenty of money, but no love. The characters in this book were written with such vivid color that they will live forever, whether in print or on screen.",
            "I read the book before seeing the movie, and the movie makes the book look horrible! I have read GWTW at least ten times and it gets better everytime I read it. I can picture the scences as I read the book. This is the ultimate love story about a woman looking for love and security when it's right in her face. I always cry at the end but I know Scarlett will get Rhett back, she'll just put it out of her mind and think of it tomorrow.",
            "This is the best book ever written. I first read it the summer before eighth grade, and then again around February of that year. There is so much drama. I read the book before seeing the movie, but I don't think it matters what order you do them in, as long as you do both. Everyone should read and watch Gone With the Wind sometime in their life. My favorite character is Scarlett, because she changes and learns so much throughout the book. She learns that she really didn't love Ashley, and she really loved Rhett, although she realized that too late. Scarlett realized how selfish she was to marry two men she didn't love. She married Charles when he was really India's beau, and regretted it when Charles died, like what happened when she stole Frank, her sister's beau. I know I gave this book five stars, but it deserves so much more. Gone With the Wind is a must read for anyone!",
            "I had fought against reading the book for many years. Having seen the movie many times, I thought &quot;Why should I wade through a thousand pages?&quot; Well, something drove me to start the book and I surprised myself by not being able to put it down. I recall actually rushing home from work, barely eating and reading late in the night. The story line is good, and the characters believable. It also provides come insight into a phase of American history, something we all could use. Don't delay - read it soon. I doubt if you'll regret it.",
            "I am 17 and just finish reading Gone with the Wind and thesequal. I loved all the charaters except Ashley. I believe everyemotion that the characters felt and I even know people who are as selfish as Scarlett. The author did a great job in describing everything but I did not enjoy the racism. But one must understand that she grew up in the early 1900s and in the south. She must have heard stories of the war because the rage and anger was still fresh in their minds. It cannot be expected that the book will not be racist when the author grew up with it. It must be overlooked in order to enjoy the great story. In the days that I read it I did not eat, sleep, talk to anybody, or even watch t.v. because it swept me into the world of the American Civil War. The 1000 and plus pages go by in a flash and you wish there were more. I suggest to everybody not to read the sequal because it ruins the characters and is completly unbelieveable and foolish. I loved Rhett, Scarett, and Melly because they have true human emotions. I recommand to watch the movie first so you won't be disappointed. You'll enjoy the handsome Clark Gable, the beautiful Vivien Leigh, and the charming Olivia de Havilland. Great novel!!!",
            "Gone With the Wind, the timeless tale of the old south, depicts colourful characters as they strugggle with the hardships of love, life and the Civil War. Scarlett O'Hara, a tragic hero, matures of her love of Ashley Wilkes, by means of her life experiences, which wisen Scarlett of her downfalls and also her attributes. The fact that the situation thrust upon her wisens her, she is forced to mature herself, and this included her selfish ways. Gone with the Wind is a classic, a must for all who study, or who are remotly interested in the modern history of America.",
            "Well, for starters, I read the book before ever seeing the movie. Margaret Mitchell did a great job on her first novel. I read Scarlett (gets a bit nasty in places, and totally unbelievable), but GWTW is THE book to read. My copy is 1,024 pages long. Don't freak. Amazingly enough, even people who don't like long books ought to like it. Now for the opinions. I hated Ashley, in the book and the movie. I didn't like Melanie very much (&quot;Oh, Melly, don't be a goose.&quot;) 'cause she was so lovable. She was basically perfect. Rhett was a total jerk at times. You probably figured out by now that I side with Scarlett. She was tough, yet tender at times. I think that this book should occupy a place on your shelf or in your hand.",
            "I'm 14. I read this book last winter and still quote words and actually use things the characters learned in this saga to improve my own life. Its almost like self-help but in such an entertaining way. The way the book is written, it is almost as if you are afraid to put the book down because the characters (especially Scarlett, she is quite busy) may do something without you. It is truely the best book I have ever read, and I don't even like historical fiction! i recommend this to anyone who can read. Enjoy!",
            "When I saw this ~1000 page book, I got shocked. Actually my mother recommended me it. I really enjoyed every page. It is not the same as learning about U.S. Civil War in history. Everything was written so perfect that it was extremely hard to put the book down when the work awaited. I have never seen so strong characters as Scarlett and Rett had. I was so sad when the book was over, wanted it to last forever. I really love thick books if they are so great that this one. READ IT !!!",
            "I read &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; at the age of 12, and, even though it took me a long time to read, it is the best book I have ever read. Even now, two years later, I use examples and quotes form the book to use in everyday life. This book has something for everyone, romance, action, drama and comedy. Margaret Mitchell is brilliant in the way that she makes you sympathasize with the enemy. You never know what will happen next and it is impossible to put down!",
            "For all of you that have read GWTW you must know why this is my favorite book ever! I am 15 and I read this book around a month ago after a friend of mine told me I just had to read it and I could not put it down. My Mom encouraged me too as she loved it also. Now I know what everyone is raving about. This saga simply swept me off my feet! This isn't just a novel for young girls...it's for everyone and you just have to read it. I was captivated by Mitchell's breathtaking descriptions of the south and how can any female just not fall in love with Rhett? It's almost impossible to describe to you all the aspects of this novel! I went through this book so fast...at times I laughed but there were also times when you ge so annoyed, frusturated and angry at Scarlett's antics (forget about Ashley already!) but you cannot help loving her for who she is too. Though GWTW may not be 100% historically accurate...who really cares!? Also, I just saw the movie...don't miss it!! That was just wonderful as well. (it was also voted the #2 Romance movie of all time by the Amerian Film Institute recently!) As for the sequel, Scarlett, I was a little dissapointed but I had to have closure and have the comfort of knowing Rhett took Scarlett back. All in all, read Gone With the Wind! This monumental epic has all the aspects of a book anyone could ever look for.",
            "You can tell by every other review of this book and probably by the advice of people you know that &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; is an enduring classic. I LOVE THIS BOOK! But, be warned that this paperback edition has several spelling and gramatical errors. I was quite disapointed by the editing done here.",
            "Gone With The Wind is one of the most powerful works of literature I've ever read- its fluildy eloquent style and intricatly crafted descriptions make it seem more like a scene being played out, rather than words on page. I couldn't put it down- there are so many twists, and nothing turns out the way you hope it would. This is the best book I've ever read, and I recommend it to everyone.",
            "Gone With the Wind is a great book that gives lots of descriptive detail, it as if you are there in the story. The book puts the movie to shame. I read the book before seeing the movie and I am glad I did. With as much detail that is in the book it is hard to make any kind of movie from it. The book story line is set during the Civil War. Placing the story during the Civil War makes the action and adventure seeker want to read the book. Although the book takes about war a lot there are several love triangles in the book. Having these love triangles in the story keeps the tension in the story and makes the read wonder who will be with who next. Having the story take place during this time brings a sense of realism to the book and makes the reader feel for the characters during this time. The book is also set in the point of view of the south. Having the book take place in the south is different and makes the reader realize why the war was being fought. This is a very fun book to read and I would recommend it anyone.",
            "Gone With The Wind is the best book I have ever read. I like it because of the setting{I like the old time books}and the characters. I also like it because it is very long and keeps my interest, which is very hard to do. So I think it is a good book to read.",
            "This is an great book. The character interaction, the historical sweep, everything. If you love, or even like, the movie, you should definitely read this book. There are so many things, even characters, in the book that were left out of the movie, the book fleshes everything out. I absolutely recommend this book!",
            "As an avid reader, I read this book, all 1037 pages, within about a week. I just couldn't put it down. Margaret Mitchell has skillfully woven life's everyday struggles in with the struggles only faced during Reconstruction. Although I do not beleive in Scarlett's thoughts about the war and Yankees and so on, it was almost hard not to empathyize with her and her struggles. Although all in all a nasty person, sometimes you can't help but love her.The strength of character portrayed by Melanie Wilkes has decided for me what I will name my first little girl. Melanie.As for Rhett, I do believe he is my favorite of them all.",
            "This book was an amazing view of the Civil War era as well as a beautiful love story. It is a testament to the strain the war caused on every person in the country at the time. Aside from the war it let's you in to the parts of your soul that too many try to hide. Some people think Scarlett was a demon, but I think she was and is a part of every person. Everyone should read GWTW. If you don't your really missing out. It is by far the best I've ever read and I'm convinced I'll never find better.",
            "This book is magical. It is enthralling and hard to peel your eyes away from. It is a delight to read and when you pull yourself away your mind is still in the old South. I found myself often dazed when I wasn't reading it. It is time consuming. Though this book is fantastic I both loved and hated the ending. It just didn't feel right. Like it wasn't finished and it desperatley needed a sequal. It would have been wonderful if Margaret Mitchell had written the sequal but she didn't so A. Ripley gave it her best shot. Although she is critizised for it I thought is was good as I don't believe GWTW is finished without the most famous characters of all time; Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler, together and in love.",
            "Margaret Mitchell's timeless classic, Gone With the Wind, is a book about young, Scarlett O'hara, who is madly in love with another woman's husband. She struggles through the hardships of the Civil War, supporting herself and her family. Her story is one of the strongest I have ever read. I recommend this book to everyone-it has just the right amount of romance, sadness, and truth in it to make it one of the greatest books.",
            "i hate book and love movi",
            "The fact that so many people still love this book just shows how racist we still are. It does NOT make it a good book just because you \"like\" it.Don't start with me about Mammy, or about how Scarlett O'Hara doesn't change at ALL throughout the book, except for getting \"tougher.\" Margaret Mitchell did much to immortalize the ridiculous fantasy of \"The South\" that we still cling to today. I'm not saying that there weren't good moments back in Antebellum days, but let's be realistic. In \"Reading Lolita in Tehran,\" the author (I have forgotten her name, may she forgive me) states somewhere that \"even if you're under a benevolent dictator, you're still under a dictator.\"And before I get screams of rage from people who probably also believe in wearing white at their wedding, just remember: just because YOU like it, doesn't mean it's not racist. Just read it with a new eye. That's all I ask. And if you claim that \"ruins\" it, then okay, good. There are plenty of books about plucky heroines that you can read instead, like Jamaica Kincaid's \"Annie John\" and \"Lucy\". Oh, and read \"A Small Place\" while you're at it, to read what Caribbean folks think about our jaunty little cruises down their way.It has to hurt for a while for people to change.",
            "Gone with the wind is an all time classic. This book is about a girl named Scarlett O'Hara who has a wonderful life until war breaks out and her world is turned upside down.She has to learn the basics to surviving but it comes with difficulty. Along the way she loses two husbands but has one final one which lasts. His name is Rhett Buttler. He helps her become a rich woman again. But is she truly happy? You will have to read to find out. Through all of this there is a moral which is, don't take what you have for granted and apprciate what you have because one day you may not have it.",
            "This book is by far the greatest love story of all time. The ignorant Scarlett O'hara is accustomed to getting her way all the time, but suddenly her once so stable, cushioned life falls out from between fingers. Choosing which dress to wear to balls used to be the issue, now Scarlett must struggle to find each meal, not only for herself but also for the family she supports. As the end of the war begins to approach Scarlett is a young woman who has seen the worst, and still hopes for the best. This book if the timeless tale of a Confederate blockader and a fiesty Southern belle.",
            "Gone With the Wind will totally blow you away, it surely blew me away. This book is a classic love story. It totally draws you in with the push-pull relationship between the main characters, Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara. It makes you want to scream at Scarlett because she just pushes Rhett away unknowingly, and Rhett is trying to pull her into love with money and luxurious clothes. This book is a good book because the events could happen in our time, marry for money and make your selves misreable, but who knows how it could end. If you enjoy books that make you throw them down in frustration, but pick them back up again just to find out what happens next, this book is definitely good for you. If you enjoy this book or were unhappy with the ending, breeze through Scarlett, the sequel to Gone with the Wind. Gone With the Wind is an outstanding book and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys suspense and love all mixed together in a great book.",
            "i think this book is wonderful!i've always liked Gone with the Wind,but when my mom bought it for me,i looked at it and it was so huge,that it took me a long time to finally start reading it.but when i did,not even a bomb could of stopped me from putting it down.i read it every time a got a chance to(between commercials,before school,after school,from 6 to midnight)i even stopped doing everything else i used to do just so i could read it.it is so well written,that you know the characters in and out,even though you never met them.i knew what the characters were like,but just like in real life,there was just so much to know about them,that it's impossible to describe a character.this is the first book and movie that has ever made me cry.when,finally,at the end of the book,scarlett realized that she loves rhett, and not ashley,it's too late and the sad ending(at that time) seemed worse than anything i've ever had to think about.at first,i was mad at three people:rhett,scarlett,and ashley(if you can believe it).rhett-because he didn't tell scarlett that he loved her after they were married(at least not enought for scarlett)and scarlett is too childish to realize that all those things that he for her and her children is because he loves her.scarlett-because her stupid pride stopped her from telling him that she loves him in time and for not telling him that she was sorry for anything that she did or said.and ashley-for realizing and telling scarlett that he doesn't love her way too late.but,in spite of all this,i love this book and i will recommend this to anyone in a heartbeat.",
            "Margaret Mitchell's evergreen saga of the Civil War era has become a kind of cultural icon. This sprawling novel was her sole work, but what a book! Two of the leading protagonists, Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler, are perhaps the best known fictional characters in American literature. The saintly Melanie Wilkes and her reticent husband Ashley are also widely recognized.Northern writers have yet to produce a comparable work. Mitchell's novel plugs into the antebellum nostalgia of the south. Even though her writing arguably does not meet the high standards of gifted southern writers (such as Flannery O'Connor and company), her wonderful narrative skills continue to make this book an enduring best-seller, decade after decade.As generations of American booklovers will testify, &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is a highly rewarding, romantic must-read.",
            "Hello! I read this book because I felt like I had to( It's a classic) and I did think it would be extremely sentimental, soap opera- like and, in Germany where I live we say KITSCHIG. But after a few pages I realised that it was exciting, and I didn't put it down all day. The one thing I disliked was the Ku- Klux- Clan scenes. They all apreciated this terrible, violent clan. This made me angry.Scarlett is a great charakter. She's not sympathatic, but when finally her beloved ones die and turn away from her, you feel sorry for her. A must-have-read!!!!",
            "Gone with the Wind is the most amazing novel ever! I read it in 8th grade for a school project and was so engrossed all 1,024 pages took me just two weeks! Living in the \"North\", I had never really thought about how hard it was for the \"South\" because I assumed they brought it on themselves. This book really opened my eyes and I'm glad it did. I love it so much that this year ... I read it again, just for fun, during the school year and it only took me two weeks again!! I highly recomend this novel to anyone and everyone in the world!",
            "I am not sure how anyone can read the book and not see the love story. It may come near the end, but yes it is there. Gone With the Wind is one of the best books ever written. It incorporates action, romance, drama... I often find myself using silly facts that you learn from the book. Gone With the Wind gives the modern public a look at what life was like for a Southern plantation owner during the Civil War, and no book will ever challenge the status Gone with the Wind has achieved.",
            "This book had everything I like to read about in it. From the vivacious Scarlett, to the loyal Melanie, to the blatant Rhett, the soft Ashley, and all the others, this book has it all. It includes comedy, tragedy, history, emotion, and many other things. My favorite character was Melanie. Scarlett drove me nuts. You get so pulled into the book that I actually stopped reading for a while because Scarlett was eing so mean to Melanie!! Definately a must read in the life of a true gentleperson.",
            "&quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is one of those impossible-to-put-down sagas that everyone should read. It is a perfect read in the summer-nearly 1000 pages to keep you reading throughout those long, lazy days. &quot;Scarlett O'Hara was not beautiful, but men seldom realized it&quot;...from the first lines of the book we are enchanted. And the passionate, emotional story of Scarlett O'Hara is the story of a how a war changed Scarlett's life, the story of how a pampered Southern belle became a woman changed by terrible circumstances. It is a love story, a story of one person, and story of Civil War-era South.There are a couple of key things that make this book the classic that it is. First, Margaret Mitchell really is one of those &quot;born&quot; storytellers. She is wonderful with description, and makes us &quot;feel&quot; things, yet seems to know exactly how much description is too much or too little. She effortlessly creates a seamless story taking place over many years, with never a dull moment on any one of the 954 pages. That alone is enough to make a novel &quot;stand out&quot;.&quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is also filled with vibrant characters. Margaret Mitchell's effective descriptions and keen insights into the minds of each character make this book even better. There is Scarlett, whose stubborn streak, determined mind, and desperate love we see and identify with; there is Melanie, sweet, trusting, and fiercely loyal (she happens to be my favorite character); there is Rhett, the puzzling, reckless, and mysterious blockader who is much like Scarlett; and there is Ashley, the one love that Scarlett cannot have.The only thing about this book that ISN'T absolutely perfect is the racism. Like many Southerners at that time, Margaret Mitchell had a very biased opinion of black people and their place in society. It was disturbing to read descriptions such as &quot;their monkey-like faces&quot; and &quot;darkies need to be treated like children&quot; in this book. However, I think this was in the book because that was how it WAS in the South then, not necessarily because the author thought it SHOULD BE that way. Racism is certainly wrong, but that was a part of the Southern way of life before, during, and after the Civil War.&quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is a wonderfully captivating book filled with characters that we can all identify with. Read it and you'll certainly see why this book, first published in 1936, is still popular today.",
            "I first read this book and saw the movie 35 years ago as a young teenager. Seeing that it was the 75th anniversary of the book, I decided to pick it up again. I am so glad I did. I didn't remember much about the book or movie after all these years.Mitchell did a fantastic job of describing people and settings. The story is about romance, family, survival, loss and determination. The characters are presented as real people with both good and bad points. Scarlett is manipulative and selfish for the most part but also loyal to her family when times are hard. Melanie is ever so sweet and innocent but we also see she is smarter than she first appears. Ashley is book smart and brave on the battlefield but is stuck in following the rules of conduct he has been taught his whole life. Rhett can be selfish and mean but deep down he really cares about people.I have lived in Georgia all my life. I grew up near Macon, where Sherman's troops marched. My 7th grade Georgia History teacher was a huge Civil War buff and made sure we learned more than just what was in the classroom history book. We saw the places the troops fought, we heard the stories handed down through the generations of the war, we read newspaper articles from that time period. Most of us were descended from people who experienced the war in their backyard. Often historical novels have twisted facts to fit the story, but the historical and geographical details of this book are accurate.For the critics who say this book is racist, you need to understand it is based on one view point of the south at that time. Not all Southerners owned slaves, very few owned plantations the size of the fictional Tara. Many slaves were mistreated, and of course owning another person is wrong. Rich whites did look down on poor whites. Whites did look down on blacks. But that is what happened at the time. The book isn't glorifying racism. It is just describing how a rich white family saw things during the 1860's in Georgia.Also, many of the men fighting were not slave owners but were just trying to protect their family. They did what most of us would do if we felt someone was coming to hurt and kill our families. Lincoln didn't set out to free the slaves. His main objective was to preserve the country as one entity.",
            "One of the best novels I've ever read. Margaret Mitchell has a way of bringing the reader into a tumulus period in the United States history. Near 1000 pages but easy to read and informative to what Southerners went through. Should be required reading in high schools of the U.S.",
            "Ever read a good book? My favorite book is Gone With the Wind. The Main characters are Scarlett O'Hara, Ashley Wilkes (BOY), and Melanie Hamilton. Since Scarlett is mensioned more often, we'll call her the mainest character. Scarlett is selfish, arrogant, hypocrative, and just down right mean!In this story, Scarlett is in love with Ashley. Ashley is to marry his cousin, Melly,( Sick right?), even though he loves Scarlett. Though Scarlett tries to make him jealous by marrying other men, Ashley stays loyal to his frail wife. Then, Scarlett, after 2 marriges that ended in the husband's death, comes upon a broad-backed, strong, handsome, rich, Charlestonian man. In the end, Scarlett ends up with her 3rd husband, leaving her with 2 children from previous marriges, one dead child, no friends, a large house, and oodles of money! Isn't this what she's wanted?Although this story is from evil Scarlett's point of view, it's still a wonderful story full of action, romance, sad and happy times, and hilarious scenes that don't quite seem to fit. Scarlett does the most hilarious things to get Ashley to notice her and he does many in return. I think that this book should be for 8th grade and up. If you're a boy you have to LOVE romance to like this and ladies don't need to be any personality or like any types of books, because there's things for all appeal.CAUTION: This book may lead to much dictionary research and much more study of the Civil War!",
            "This is a story about the life of a spoiled, selfish woman, Scarlett, going through the civil war period. It gives you an understanding of south's point of view. Several reviewers complained that it is racist. I would agree with those people but I don't like reading books that I agree with all the time. I found it valuable to try to understand what motivated the south to fight to preserve slavery. It seemed Mitchell was almost trying to defend slavery; if this offends and upsets you, then perhaps this may not be an enjoyable book for you.The character development is outstanding in this book. I constantly found myself comparing the book's characters with people I know. I've read many Michener books, which are also long historical fictions. I enjoy his books a lot, but this was far better than any of his books due primarily to her excellent character development.This book will stay with me forever.",
            "This will always be my all-time favourite book. The most sumptuous and vivd imagery. Such intriguing and authentic characters. And of course Scarlett is one of the most fascinating women in literary history precisely because she is so ahead of her time and dared to be different. I just love her though I certainly don't like her much!As much as I adore the movie as well, particularly the exquisite Vivien Leigh, it doesn't capture even half the richness of the novel.This is one book I re-read every few years and continue to find new elements to fascinate every time.",
            "I was out of non-fiction and had to settle for a novel, so why not the most famous of all? A smart move! I've read many historical accounts of the Civil War from many perspectives: The North, the South, the general, the private, the battle, the location, the time period,, and there is even one from the point of view of a horse! This is Scarlett O'Hara's view from her plantation, Tara, outside of Atlanta. What a refreshing perspective! The story is grand and Mitchell's graphic style keeps the images flashing onto every page. Yes, Scarlett is a bitch, but that just makes her all the more desirable. Yes, this is a \"girl's book,\" as was often pointed out to me, but guys can show their feminine side while reading of General Sherman laying waste to Georgia! A tip: See the movie first, it's a good introduction to the book. I read the book first and then saw the movie. The movie was so condensed that it almost seemed to run on fast-forward.",
            "I've seen the movie so many times I can recite it. But the book is so much better!! For lovers of the movie, you have to suck it up and take on 1024 pages of passion, despair, and the most amazing love story ever.I love Scarlett and yet at the same time I want to wring her neck. I wish I had Rhett Butler - I'd treat him right!! At the end of the book, just like the end of the movie, I ended up with tears running hopelessly down my cheeks.In addition to the adventures of a spirited young woman from Georgia, Scarlett also reveals much truth about the devastation witnessed in Georgia throughout the war and during the terrible years of Reconstruction.It's a gem to be treasured, and read over again.",
            "Margaret Mitchell presents characters whose depth is astonishing, and depictions of varied relationships that can reach the reader on numerous levels. This is not merely a love story or glorified version of a tragic historical period, but an intense treatment of much of the paradox in human nature.Regarding the racial issue - I would say that the depiction of blatant racism in this book is all the more powerful because everything is told from the Southern aristocrat's point of view. The characters need to believe, and have convinced themselves, that they are benevolent and affectionate towards their slaves! Yet they refer to these same people as &quot;apes&quot; without seeing their own horrifying stance. When Melanie, supposedly the soul of kindness, tells Ashley that, if they move North, they cannot let Beau attend school and &quot;have pickaninnies in his class,&quot; it shows the horror of racism just as clearly as if the reader had seen the miserable lot of the slaves.Scarlett, certainly no heroine and one with no principles who'd like merely the reputation for being a &quot;great lady,&quot; is a most intriguing character. As Margaret Mitchell makes clear in many references, we have here one who is incapable of being at all analytical. (Except for Rhett, and, to some extent, Gerald, only Mammy can see through Scarlett's facade.) The Ashley she loves is a creation of her imagination - and it is interesting that, for all that she despises Melanie, the traits Melanie has which Scarlett most derides are very much the same as those in the Ellen that she idolises.The book has so many fascinating characters that one could read it ten times and still find one has only scratched the surface. Those like myself, who cannot imagine too many settings they'd like to enter less than the &quot;old South,&quot; can find it interesting to explore the situation of those who find their entire world has collapsed around them.",
            "Gone With The Wind is the best book ever written short of the Bible.I have heard people say it's rascist- my opinion is why sugarcoat everything that happened in the Civil War? I think there was rascism at the time the book takes place. The book was written with exhaustive historical truth- if you make it sound like blacks ran around in tuxedos, then you undermine their suffering. And make the book unreal.People did suffer, but not all slaves suffered.If you're looking for a superbly written romance, if you are smart enough to see through people, you will love GWTW. IF you can't, you won't be able to see how Scarlett, shrewd, hard, proud, stubbern, is also smart, learns how to yield, proud as a virtue, and persistant. She complains and dreams the whole time she saves Tara but through sheer grit she does it and saves the people on it.You maybe cannot see how Rhett Butler loves this unseeing woman with complete passion, devotion- 'as much as a man can love a woman'. How the dishonest blockade runner goes crazy when his adored little girl dies. How he is a real daddy to Scarlett's other fatherless children.Read this book--- it is all about people. Anytime we can see ourselves in something, with a small sense of guilt we indenify and fall in love with it.GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!!!",
            "I loved this book! The most amazing thing about GONE WITH THE WIND (and there are many) are the beautiful characters that Mitchell creates. I felt pain, and laughter right along with Scarlett. All the characters seemed so real to me, and I grew to love them so. Mitchell is so brave to have not made a person like Melanie as the main character, a person that everyone would love. Instead she forces the reader to fall in love with a selfish, stubborn, mean, hateful person like Scarlett. Scarlett is definetly my favorite literary figure, she is by no means a perfect person, but you see parts of yourself in her, parts that you may not want to see, and that makes her all the more real. True to form, the most interesting characters in the book are the people with more sinister sides to themselves. To compliment Scarlett, there is of course, Rhett Butler. Every episode he was in came to life, just by the addition of his witty back handed comments, and his insightfullness to realize just how unscrupulous he and others are. Every diolouge is a joy, be it anyone from Prissy, to Rhett speaking, the words fly fromt the page, and never get boring. The turns that the book takes never fail to surprise. Once I got into this book, I couldn't put it down. The most important thing to remember while reading it though, is to take the book as it is. In parts, tales of the blacks lording over the whites, and the views of slaves, are hard to swallow, and painful to read. And they are not entirely accurate. But this was written by a southerner, in a different time, about an EXTREMELY different time, so all of these things must be taken in stride, and read with caution. Over all, this is a book that which will tear at your heart, make you cry with laughter, and, even make you fall in love with an ignorant, racist, Southern Belle.",
            "I began this novel in the 11th grade prepared to hate it to the core. Everything I knew about it made me expect a silly, eye-batting trip into a fairy tale world of the Old South with its impossibly virtuous ladies, its foppish gentleman and grinning content slaves, and I was actually looking forward to making fun of the characters, story and author.I could NOT have been more wrong about this novel. Margaret Mitchell, I salute you!This is to American letters what Les Miserables is to France, or War And Peace is to Russia. Nowhere else are characters like these to be found or is the human spirit portrayed as so unconquerable. I fell in love with this book. From its would-be detractor I became its most vocal champion. I was stunned over and over at how inutterably magnificent this contribution to literary greatness was. As one reads along about the lives of these larger than life men and women all set against the backdrop of the fall of an entire civilization, any sensitive person can only be compelled to acknowledge that there on the open page is a book that shall live in literary eternity.Of any work of fiction a person might feel compelled by \"duty\" to read at some point in a lifetime, Gone With The Wind deserves to be at the head of that list.",
            "This is a wonderful leatherette version, with a self ribbon place marker and a lovely gold dark gold and blue cover and heavy fine paper, with plenty of cloth fiber used in the making of the paper. This makes a better grade of paper only used in the best of books and stationary.They just don't make them like this any more!Chaska",
            "Gone with the Wind is a timeless, sweeping, epic masterpiece of American literature. It is the story of the South right before the Civil War, during the war, and the aftermath when Reconstruction began in the South. It is filled with drama, romance, tragedy, real characters with flaws, and I can see why this book won a Pulitzer Prize and why it continues to be a very popular book decades after it was first published in 1936.I don't need to go into a synopsis of the book, if anyone hasn't heard of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler, I'd be very surprised. If you have only seen the wonderful movie adaptation of the book, but have never read the book, I highly recommend you read the book. The movie doesn't capture the essence of the characters, the entirety of their personalities and motives behind certain actions and behaviors.I was captivated from the very first page. I can't describe exactly how or why, but Mitchell wrote in such a way that pulls you into the story. Her writing is simple and straightforward, and it touches you in a way that helps you relate to the characters and the world she wrote about. Her writing resonates with you, and keeps you reading. Her writing of the scenery and backdrop of the South, her depictions of the various characters, their motives, their thoughts, their innermost secrets that make them who they are. Mitchell brought this time period to life and causes you, the reader, to empathize with the characters and the struggles and upheaval they go through.Even though I know this story, how it unfolds and how it concludes, I couldn't turn the pages fast enough until I reached the very end. Scarlett O'Hara isn't the most sympathetic character you'll encounter, but as I gradually read her story, I found myself liking this character and rooting for her happily ever after, although you know she doesn't get that HEA in the end. I actually found the ending appropriate, it fits in with Scarlett's personality of a person who won't quit no matter what. She has seen the worst in life, and she remains stubborn in defeat that she can win back Rhett's love.Scarlett was a very selfish, manipulative, and cruel young woman, the only person she cared about was herself (with the exception of her mother, Ellen O'Hara, who she revered and respected and was the only woman she trusted). She was a simple person, not easily able to understand more serious and complex issues, which she usually shrugged off in a careless fashion as insignificant and unworthy of her time. She presented a facade of a lady of gentility to the world, all the while seething secretly inside at what she perceived as injustices against her or the unfairness of life if she didn't get her way. She was also willfully stubborn in her unrequited love for childhood friend, Ashley Wilkes, and it was quite sad to see her pine for a man who rejected her even though he did love her but was too cowardly to do anything about it.Despite her numerous character flaws, Scarlett had some admirable traits, such as her perseverance and flinty determination to survive. There were so many times where she was numb with weariness and feeling desolate at the heavy burden on her shoulders, but she would always put off her morose thoughts and say, \"I will think about it later\", and mentally force herself to take it one step at a time in order to stay sane and calm in a chaotic world. This was in contrast to her weak sisters who couldn't seem to comprehend that their old lifestyle had vanished forever and that a change was needed within themselves in order to survive. Scarlett, with her unladylike blunt honesty and very practical nature realizes this almost immediately. She was so unlike her tender and kind mother, Ellen, in almost every way except in one. Like her mother before her, she became the mistress of Tara, and in her newfound role she fills her mother's shoes in becoming what her family needed. Someone to look up to and lean upon for aid when needed.I found Scarlett a contradiction of sorts. She would look upon in contempt or disgust at those who depended on her, yet she would cast such thoughts aside in order to fulfill her duty to them as she couldn't abandon them. For her family because they *were* family and an O'Hara always helped family, and for Melanie, Ashley's wife, because of a promise. On the one hand she was a strong woman, strong in that she was able to survive the devastation of the South and show a courage of spirit in facing adversity and impossibility, but on the other hand, she was weak too. Weak in continuing in her girlhood, idealistic, puppy love for Ashley that blinded her to real, true lasting love with Rhett Butler who was her true soul mate. In some ways she was finally a woman, having the burden of responsibility of her family forcing her to mature, but in other ways, in her relationship with men, she was still a child. Of course, in the latter category she realizes too late what she knew instinctively all along, that Rhett Butler was the man for her and she had just been too immature, stubborn, and childish to see it clearly.Rhett Butler was the perfect match for fiery Scarlett. He was exactly like her, unscrupulous and looking to number one first (although, he did have his gentlemanly and kind moments beneath the veneer of mockery and sardonic amusement). Unlike Scarlett, he didn't pretend to be what he was not. He was no refined Southern gentleman and he took perverse pleasure in flaunting this in subtle ways. He is basically Scarlett in masculine form, only more intelligent.Some of my favorite moments of the book were the scenes with Rhett and Scarlett sparring with the other. It was amusing to see Rhett get the upper-hand over Scarlett every time. His witty quips most times went completely over her head, as she wasn't as clever as he, but that made it all the more amusing to see Scarlett finally meet her match in Rhett. I laughed aloud several times as I read Scarlett getting frustrated and upset stating he was no gentleman, only to see him laugh at her and agree with her he wasn't. Other scenes I enjoyed reading was the scenes back at Tara after she fled Atlanta, where you are witness to the transformation of Scarlett the Southern belle to Scarlett the survivor as she toiled in the cotton fields in Tara and tried to put food on the table for her family.I thought it was quite saddening to read about the delusions people in the South had regarding the war. The characters in Atlanta, such as Mrs. Merriweather or Dr. Meade, with their desperate, futile hope, and optimism that the South would prevail was sad to read about. Defiant to the end, in their naive and stubborn pride they thought the South and \"the Cause\" they fought for would triumph no matter the cost. It was this hope they clung to even as Atlanta was under siege by the Union army. None would know (or wanted to admit to knowing), except those perceptive enough to see the truth, such as Rhett Butler or Ashley Wilkes, that the way of life the South enjoyed up to the war was dead and gone. An old world that wouldn't come back, even if they had won, as it was forever changed, and like the title of the book gone with the wind. This book was poignantly sorrowful in that regard, you get a brief glimpse into the South portrayed pre-war and then post-war, and you realize it was never to be the same again.Although this story is told from the perspective of a Southern woman and her story of surviving the war, I think one could say her personal story reflects on a larger scale the entire South's struggles to survive in a new and changed world. The scenes of the ruined and abandoned plantations, with their eerie tomb stillness, was described in very convincing detail, and I found myself with Scarlett mourning the lost world she loved and grew up in.I could keep on writing about the various aspects of this story that were enjoyable and what I thought, but this review would get very lengthy if I did! Let me say this: the book was wonderful. Just read it! You won't regret it, yes, it is quite a hefty book but this story is so engrossing, compelling, and captivating you won't even notice how long the book is.",
            "This is my favorite book of all time. Maay critics of today have harsh criticism for this book, but a book is not always ment to meet current day social standards, it is supposed to take you away and entertain you. This is exactly what GWTW does and quite superbly I may add. If you are looking for an enchanting story if survival, adventure, romance, and whimsy, than do not hesitate to buy this book.",
            "What can I add that has not already been said about this novel? It truly is one of the best novels ever written. I read over 75 books every year, many of them historical novels. I don't know why I waited so long to read this one, but I'm glad I finally did. And no, I haven't seen the movie. The characters were multi-dimensional and despite their often-displayed negative qualities, we keep hoping for them. They are more real and probably like ourselves than most of us would care to admit. Perhaps that is the real beauty of the story. We can see how selfish actions can lead to consequences without having to live through the pain ourselves. The style is easy to read and enjoyable to follow. And the backdrop of the Civil War and the early reconstruction period (from the South's point of view) is among the best I've ever run across. Despite its length, the book keeps you enthralled, every step of the way. This is one of those classics that you simply must read, not because you should, but because you will be so glad you did.",
            "When my mom brought this home, at first I thought I wouldn't understand it. I started the book because I had seen the motion picture and fell in love with all of the characters. Once I started I could NOT stop! I read in the shower, I read while I was brushing my teeth, I read late into the night when I was supposed to be sleeping. I am only eleven years old but I still hold Gone With the Wind a treasure to my heart. My favorite character was Melanie. I became Melanie for the couple of weeks that I read this book. I adored Ashley and admired Rhett Butler. I read with intent interest at Scarlett's luxurious life,I struggled through the Civil War. I felt the O'hara family's hunger too. Even though I am young,I say this book is up there with the best literature there is!",
            "This is the greatest romance ever written, and at over 1000 pages long, most people will finish it within days, reading it in bed, at the table, in the bathroom, in the car, on the way to the mailbox, just because you can't put it down, and every page is a page-turner. Fantastic dialogue, fantastic scenery, fantastic character development. You'll remember whole passages and be able to quote from it.",
            "Great book. A must read, though whether or not you like it is up to you. I've loved this book since I was fourteen, and I think it is one of the best novels to ever come out of America.It drives me crazy when people say this book is racist. Really? A book written by a southerner, closely related to former slave owners? Racist? NO! The book is written about a south that the people of the south say and believed in, and the characters are all people who fit into this setting. This wasn't a story about enlightenment and aboltionism. It was a story about a woman in the south and the Civil War and reconstruction through her eyes. Not your eyes. Not the eyes of the northern aboltionists. Not the eyes of a slave. It was shown through the eyes of half the population of the US at the time, and that people try to nullify these views is wrong. This is the way people thought and felt, and villifying all slave owners (many of whom grew up in that society and didn't know much better) is no better than making all negroes stupid. In the end, it's a work of fiction. A book. Reading and enjoying it doesn't make someone a racist, and I would hope that people would please stop saying that. Don't like the book? Don't read it. I, for one, would say that books like \"The Wind Done Gone\" is no less racist, though there will be hell to pay if someone actually says it out loud.",
            "The summer I was 15, between Junior High and High School, my mother recommended that I read this book. Of course I wasn't going to listen to HER...so I pouted around for a few days, and then one evening, afraid I was going to succumb to utter boredom, I picked it up.For the next week, I did nothing but read Gone with the Wind. I read it every waking moment, far into the night, first thing in the morning. I remember having a perpetual headache from eyestrain. I simply could not stop until the last page, when I burst into tears, and sobbed for what seemed like hours.The book has much the same effect on me now. Every few years, I read it cover to cover, even though I can quote key passages by heart by this time. So let me tell you a little bit about Gone with the Wind, the first thing being that it is not what you think it is. It's hard to compete with David O'Selznick here, even though he's dead, but I beg you to put the movie aside, and prepare yourself for sheer, satisfying, bosom-heaving pleasure. This was a thoroughly amazing book in the thirties, and it wears well. It is much more than the story of spoiled, willful Scarlet O'Hara and her deadly flirtations. Scarlet may have been the first feminist. Women in her day had no power whatsoever. Their entire lives were decided by convention: whom they should marry, what they should eat, where they should live, what they should wear. But Scarlet would have none of it. And the only way she could break free of convention was to use her wiles to flaunt it. She did--and it worked. She was and is my hero, selfish and vain as she was.On quite another level, this is the heartbreaking story of the War Between the States from the Southern point of view. As a teen who was raised in California, I had no clue about how the South felt about the War, and no way to find out. This book, silly as some may find it, taught me that there are two sides to any conflict, two equally powerful and opposing points of view that are tragically at odds. Sound familiar? Not much different than the Middle East today.Now a word about the book's purported racism. Yes, there are slaves in this book, and I am not going to presume to tell you not to resent or be angry about that fact. But considering the time in which she lived, I think that Margaret Mitchell tried to deal with the issue of slavery as best she could. The slaves in the book are not the simpering fools of the movie. They are portrayed with as much dignity as I think Mitchell could manage when considering that there was no way she could condone OR ignore that slavery was a fact during the Civil War. Mammy is not a caricature in the book, Prissy is a much more sympathetic young woman, and the other slaves are portrayed as thinking, feeling, human beings.The Emancipation is not regretted, and is seen from the freed slaves' point of view as much as possible. That having been said, I am not advocating this book as something it is not. It is not an abolitionist work, and it is not anti-slavery per se. It is not anything more than phenomenally well-written story with a lot of truly interesting historical information about the 1860s and beyond.Gone with the Wind is the story of a lifetime, not the caliber of War and Peace, but for its time, incredibly good reading. Summer is almost upon us. This is a perfect time to sit under a magnolia tree with a mint julep and treat yourself to an old-fashioned story you'll never forget.",
            "When I was in middle school I shared my locker with my best friend. Her favorite movie and book were Gone With the Wind, we had posters in the locker and she talked about it non-stop. I looked at it, saw how long it was and laughed at her for her obccession.Now as a senior in college I decided to pick it up and see what all the fuss was about. I don't have a lot of time to read during the semester, but I had this book finished in less then 3 weeks. I didn't want to put it down, and it ate at me during classes to not know what was going on in Atlanta in my absence.This is quite possibly the most amazing book I have ever read. Mitchell's writting style is amazingly easy to read dispite the era she was writing during, and her descriptions make the state of Georgia come alive for a girl who has never left New England.The character of Scarlett both infuriated me and drew commanalities to myself. While sometimes you want to scream at the book and make her realize her love for Rhett hundreds of pages before she does, I think theres a little of every women in her. Her hopes and fears are still very real so many years later.I am so happy to have read this book, and now its one I'll reread in a few years. I highly reccamend it and am completely in love with it.",
            "Let me make a simple statement: This novel is a perfect interpretation of the Antebellum bourgeousie South. Margaret Mitchell was born in the early 1900s and therefore the stories she heard, the ones that inspired this novel, were admittedly a bit skewed.HOWEVER, there is a lot of truth to Gone with the Wind, whether people like it or not, and beyond that, this novel is probably the perfect love story because it is so heartbreaking and so imperfectly human. Whether or not you agree with the portrayal of slavery, the Civil War, the Reconstruction, etc. that this novel presents, it is unfair to dismiss the greatness of Gone with the Wind. You can read all the Twain, Faulkner, Fitzgerald that you like, but until you have read this book, you do not have the full picture of American literature.",
            "Epic. Heart-rendering. Encouraging. I don't know where to start.If you have not read this book, I highly recommend it. If you have already read it, treat yourself to another read.\"Gone with the Wind\" is a book that I have read annually from the time I was a teenager. The characters keep calling me back. The story reaches out and grabs me. So, I go back every year for a visit with the characters who seem so real and present to me.What speaks to me the most is Scarlett, herself. Despite hardship, she provides for the people around her. She is determined. Scarlett is taught from childhood that who she is fundamentally is wrong and she should try to be someone else...and she does try for a while. (Does this seems familiar to any of us ladies today?) Only Rhett sees her for her true self and appreciates it. Despite being a renegade, he keeps his word, loves Scarlett and Bonnie (their daughter) honestly and deeply, while carelessly providing luxuries and lavishing them with attention. A real man!!!!! Mitchell's characters are complex, true, and touching.Also, Mitchell brings the battles of the American Civil War to life. The battles are explained in a style that is compelling and breath-taking.Scarlett and Rhett are people who are real and live life with passion and strength. If you want to meet Scarlett or flirt with Rhett, all you have to do is open the book and read as the past come to life.Happy reading!",
            "Gone with the Wind is one of the best books ever written, maybe the best.I can not even express how much I love this book.Many people disregard Gone With the Wind as a just a lenthy romance, but this is NOT what it is. Gone with the wind is SO much more than a romance. It is, for one, a book about the Civil War from the Southern people's perspective. This book gives the reader a brand new perspective on the Civil War and it is refreshingly NOT like all the other mundane Civil War books. It is full of history, but there is never a boring moment: Margret Mitchell is a brilliant writer whose beautiful and exciting descriptions, livily dialoge and none-stop story keep the book engrossing and never boring. I couldn't put it down!Again, Gone with the WInd is not just a romance, as I said, it is a refreshing Civil War book; but it is not only that. Gone with the wind has many suspensful, dangerous, and sometimes violent moments, such as The Burning of Atlanta or the event when Scarlett shoots a Yankee invader.The characters of GWTW are immortal. Each character is so beloved to so many readers, and there is a good reason why. Every character has his own fascinating personality. Every type of person, from selfish to greedy to tragic to stupid to controlling to timid to utterly kind is expressed in the book's countless engrossing characters.The story line is also wonderful. It is very complex but never confusing; it has such a good main plot and so many intriuging sub-plots.For the reasons I have attempted to state above and for so many more, Gone with the Wind is a beloved American Classic that has endured and will endure for many years to come.Whether are a man or woman, girl or boy, old or young, READ THIS BOOK!You will not regret it.And it just may be, that after you have entered the world of Gone with the Wind, you will find in it a new favorite that is worth reading over and over again.",
            "Margaret Mitchell was a genius. This book is so detailed and interesting it is hard to describe. Do not judge it by the movie. It is a very accurate portrayal of life before, during and after the War Between the States, in the South. Scarlett was not always an admirable character, but she was not boring.",
            "The love story is very well known and beautiful. If you want a great romance you won't be disappointed.However, the story behind the romance is what really made this book wonderful for me. It questioned what happens to people when society changes. What's great is that it shows many people's responses to the change. It reminded me of Chinua Achebe's THINGS FALL APART.The characterizations and descriptions are wonderful. I found this book to be very engaging and real. I would recommend it to anyone.",
            "Most will have seen the movie before ever considering reading this remarkable book. The \"bones\" of the movie are in the book, but the novel has so many more characters and details that it really makes for an excellent read. More background on Scarlett and the others and everything is much more fleshed out. Great.",
            "LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the book! What an amazing story line. It is entertaining, heart pounding at times, and very real. You can relate to the characters at times and hate them all at the same time. I think anyone will be happy to read this book and not feel like it was a waste of time. Happy Reading!!!",
            "This is one of my favorite books. Don't get me wrong, it has its faults - sometimes too-slow pacing, and deeply embedded racism to name a few. But we don't love things because they are perfect, or because of their morality. We love them because they touch us.As this book touched me.How can I explain the affecting emotion aroused in me by stubborn, foolish, sensible fiery Scarlett? Or the adoration of tough, roguish Rhett? Or the kinship I felt with the both of them? By that last, perhaps.This book is a historical romance, member of a genre known for its cliches. But it is no Harlequin. I have read enough of that genre, and am not a fan. This book is part of a genre known for crappiness, yet the romance between Rhett and Scarlett is real, not contrived, and feels real. Mitchell has accomplished what many have tried and failed to do, here: to write a strong romance novel that even readers of the non-sappy sort can enjoy.And the racism, that, too, has a purpose, though I doubt Mitchell intended it insomuch as it just was, because she herself was racist. A lot of historical novels (bad ones, at least) take characters from certain places and times, and make them into MODERN people, with MODERN values, misunderstood and inexplicably ahead of the times. Scarlett is a southern belle in the civil war south. This is the setting of the novel. Does she 'break the rules' at times? Yes. But she does not do it on every single count, and any messages thus conveyed are not overtly preachy. Mitchell has created something that is simultaneously believable, and yet transcendent, sometimes heroic, and larger-than life.",
            "I am only 11 years old. Still, no one stopped me from reading the classic, Gone With the Wind. I encourage myself. When I started reading the book, I got so caught into Scarlett, Ashley WIlkes, Melanie, and Rhett Butler, that I felt as if I were living with them as well! When I got to the end of the book, I felt as if Margaret Mitchell had left out something very valuable, like she hadn't really meant to publish the un-finished book! I am getting very crazy about Gone With the Wind, and it's truly the first book that I can ever say sincerely that was my \"Favorite book\" ever! For anyone who thinks Gone With the Wind's words are too small, or that the book is too \"mushy and gushy for us,\" it's not! It's a nice, sad romance novel that I shall remember forever. Please read it. I am currently asking for the book, in hardcover original edition, for my birthday.",
            "I LOVE THIS BOOK!! Rhett Butler is one of the best characters when it comes to writing and so is Melanie, and Scarlett. Mitchell outdid herself in this classic novel. I love the movie too, but the book is much better with so much more detail. Yes, Scarlett is a little whiny and selfish and takes Rhett for granted, but I love her anyway! Ashley is a huge git, but you have to like a lot of the other characters inculding Aunt Pitty-pat and Melanie. This book is 5 Stars and nothing can change that. I hope Mitchell is smiling down from heaven when she sees us reading her book-because it is a true gem.",
            "I actually read this book. Hard to believe because I'm not used to being bombarded with great detail and historical happenings. Not into it really. But this book was hard to put down. It was slow reading because the detail had me visualizing so much that I had to re-read a lot of passages but when I finally got through it, it was well worth the journey. Highly recommended.",
            "I first read this book when I was in 8th grade. It was for a reading program. I don't remember how long it took me to read it, but I remember thinking it was the greatest book I ever read. I have often tried to convince my friends to read it, but because of its length, they refuse. Let me tell you, the story of Scarlett and Rhett is one of the best out there. It was beautifully written by Mitchell, her descriptions of the characters are extremely vivid as if you are right there in the book with them. I recommend this book for everyone, whether or not this is your type of book. Every page will draw you closer to it and the life it shows. But ever since I have read this book, I've read it at least 3 more times since then. And it always takes me by surprise and pulls me along with it.",
            "As an author with my first novel in its initial release, I am amazed at my recent rereading of GONE WITH THE WIND. I find it hard to believe (though I've known it forever) that GONE WITH THE WIND was Margaret Mitchell's first novel. She pulled it all together here with strong characters, a remarkable plot, and fabulous writing centered around the crucial event in American history. This novel, we all know the story, has become a foundation of American culture. It deserves to be. Read this novel, or read it again, if you haven't for awhile.",
            "When I read Margaret Mitchell's classic &quot;Gone With the Wind,&quot; I was in the eighth grade and as impressionable as a young teen can be. It was my favorite for a long time, and I can still pick it up and reread it without getting bored. A cousin really loves it too, or I thought she did till I learned she loves the movie and had never read the novel. Well! She's read it now, and discovered that not only did Scarlett have other children, she also has ways and feelings you'd never know from the film alone.One example is the maid in the O'Hara household named Mammy. Though she is indeed in the movie, she is a much rounder character in the novel. On her deathbed, Scarlett stays by her side unselfishly, nursing her to the end. Other slave characters are more prominent in the novel also, such as some that move and marry. Vivian Leigh did justice to her role, as did all the others, but still, all pale in comparison to the depths they possess in the book.Screenplays are so different to read than novels that they don't seem to compare either. Sometimes a novel reads so visually that you believe the author had a film version in mind when writing it. One that struck me as such recently was &quot;The Horse Whisperer.&quot;The opening scenes with the girls on horseback, the slow-motion effect of the wreck, all of it, was like watching a movie instead of reading a book. The ability to write this way may be a great talent that most don't possess.What are you thoughts on novels to film? I'd like to know. And, if you've never read your &quot;Gone With the Wind,&quot; try it today and see what you missed in that favorite of yours.",
            "I love books, and I love history. It seems that this book was a godsend for me! Wars have never interested me, the civil war, of course seemed like a no brainer: Yankees=good, Confederates=bad. But this book has made me realize that both sides suffered. It wasn't a no-brainer...it was difficult for everyone. Girls and boys, Women, Men, everyone! So many people suffered, and were hurt. This book is a wonderful mix of adventure, romance and history, weaved together to make one of the best books of all time.",
            "I first read this book, 2 years ago, in 6th grade and loved it. This is one of the best books I'v read, along with Little Women. I love reading books about the past. The caracters were very different from most books. They wern't perfect. I also loved how Scarlett could get any man she wanted ,and did, with the exception of Rhett. It had every thing a good book should have.",
            "I have never had the concentration to sit through the movie all in one go - but I found the book, all 1000+ pages of it, compelling. Other reviewers have commented on the amount of detail put into this book, which makes it all the more real. And we are forced to sympathise and feel for characters that behave in what those of us living in the year 2000 would regard as most sexist and racist behaviour. It really gives you some understanding of how people lived and regarded each other at that time, and the different class and race structures which existed, with interesting insights into the interactions between the people who owned plantations and the slaves who worked on them. And of course, we have the character of Scarlett to contend with - one of the most spoiled and most motivated heroines ever described. I wished so much for her to open her eyes and see what a waste of time Ashley was, and how much Rhett loved her, but she is too immature to realise all this. I am debating whether I should read 'Scarlett', the recently written sequel, or just imagine her living her life out with Suellen and Will, her children and her money. A sign of a great book is the way it stays with you long after you've read it, and I often find myself rethinking passages from this book. I would recommend it for anyone.",
            "I'm a 12 year old and a little while ago finished reading GWTW. It was my favorite movie for the longest time and I decided I wanted to read the book. All my friends bet I would never finish it but I did! It may be long but there was never a dull moment. Read this book or see the movie! Actually, do both!",
            "i am completely in love with the book Gone with the Wind! Mitchell does an amazing job at using such descriptiveness as to put you right there in the story. It kept me up for nights on end as i couldn't get enough of it. This book is full of amazing characters that you grow to love and to hate. My personal favorite, Rhett Butler, made my heart skip a beat every time his name was mentioned. It is an excellent civil war romance that i could read over and over again!",
            "Being a Yankee, I never got why so many white people in the South are STILL so bugged about the Civil War and its aftermath. Well, after reading this book, now I know: those ornery white people down there are descendents of Scarlett O'Hara and Melanie Wilkes (and all those tough old white ladies, the &quot;old cats,&quot; as Scarlett calls them) and by God they just ain't never gonna FORGET! Every American (especially all you Yankees) should read this book for a better understanding of the point of view of rich white Southerners during and after the Civil War. (You still won't think they were RIGHT, by the way, but you'll understand them.) Plus, Scarlett O'Hara is a total piece of work. You've gotta get a load of all the stuff she's up to! This is a chick who could rule the freakin' world!",
            "I remember seeing this film about 40 years ago in Las Vegas. It was showing at the Las Vegas Cinerama next to the old Bonanza Hotel. It took me a couple weeks to read this book, but I really enjoyed it. Mitchell's depiction of the South after Civil War was very accurate as some of my family was from Arkansas and Mississippi so I have some idea of what that mindset was. This is a book that I will probably read i again sometime. I also found that ordering a used book through other dealers via Amazon was very effective and very easy. I will certainly use this service again.",
            "My sister recommended this book to me, saying that \"it was the best book she has ever read\". I knew that this book was amazing, judging from what my family has told me for so long, but I didn't want to read it for one reason that reason being, \"the book is over 1000 pages!!!\" So it's been lying on my shelf for more than a few years until I finally decided to read it. It took me 2 weeks to read (whereas it took my sister 5 days) it and boy, did I have an amazing time reading about Scarlett, her family, Tara, Captain Rhett Butler, Ashley Wilkes, and every body. I especially enjoyed the Southerners points of view about slavery. After readin historical books, all from the Union's point of view, I realized that I've been missing out on a lot of info on the Civil War. I've always thought that Southerners treated their slaves with cruelty, based on what I've read from other histocial fiction books, but after reading this one, I found out that slavery wasn't all about whippings, beatings, and any other kind is mismanagement.Scarlett has to be my favorite character. She is headstrong and stubborn, yes, but she fights for what she believes in and does everything to save Tara, even if it meant hurting family members. This books was dramatic, however, such as whatever someone gained, someone else loses something that is very dear to them but I guess that adds more \"zest\" to the whole story.This is, \"the best book I have ever read in my life\". Well at least in my 14 years of living. If you have the slightest interest in reading this wonderful, enchanting classic, go ahead. I did and I don't regret it.",
            "Wonderful story!! Margaret Mitchell did an amazing job in her research to make this book as accurate as possible. This is one of my favoritr books!",
            "As it always has, GWTW sweeps you up in its story about a woman who faces down adversity and never blinks. Scarlett may have flaws, but when trouble comes, she's the one everyone turns to for answers, and she's the one who has solutions. For many women, especially myself,it's still the most compelling American novel of all time.",
            "I had already read this book, I just reread it because i needed to add it to my kindle. Remains to this day my favorite book!",
            "Absolutely beautiful antique book. Crisp pages, tight binding, and that \"old musty book\" smell well all love. Couldn't be more happy with the service and speed of delivery. Love it!",
            "I remember going to the old Orpheum Theater with my mother and my best friend to see \"Gone With the Wind\" 'in the summer of 1969. I was so excited to see my first grown up film. I can see the maroon curtains unveiling the movie screen as the lights dimmed. Not a sound could be heard, but the opening strains of music and there was Tara! I was smitten. Laura and I sat through the second showing too. Exhausted, but roiled up was I when I got home. On my lonely supper plate laid my very first copy of Margaret Mitchell's GONE WITH THE WIND! Needless to say, I wolfed down supper and went to my room and began reading the book that I've had a love affair with since that summer day.With each reading I notice something I've missed in prior readings. I still find Slavery to be the abomination as it has always been. And it must have been harder to read about a mere 75 years after the end of the Civil War in 1936 when GONE WITH THE WIND was first published. I'm not surprised that this epic historical novel won the Pulitzer Prize in 1937. Mitchell has created a multitude cast of characters, giving each their own distinct voice. The reader can tell the difference between Pork, Mammy, Prissy, and Uncle Peter and that is credit to Mitchell. But even minor characters sound different. Tara, Twelve Oaks, and Atlanta also become fascinating characters too. As Tara represents the ability to change as the new South rises in defeat of its old genteel feudal life style where every man, women, and child are free to live as they want. Twelve Oaks reflects the Old South that is forever torn asunder. It is Ashley's South. He doesn't fit in with the change. He and Melanie are perfect for each other. She understands him and the dream that was the Old South.Rhett Butler hates that Old South because it tossed him out and turned its back on him. His bitterness fuels his pleasure as he sees its demise as Atlanta burns and his pockets are full of Gold. He is the most transformed character in GONE WITH THE WIND. I'd never observed his transformation as I did in this reading. No wonder the 35 year old fell for the fiery self willed 16 year old Scarlett O'Hara. Not only is she spirited, she possess a dogged determination of those who seem to get their way most of the time. It is Scarlett whom Aunt Pitty and Melanie feel safe in the absence of a man in their Atlanta household. It is Scarlett who makes sure her kith and kin are safe, housed, and fed. She tells us that she'll never be hungry again no matter if she has to cheat, steal, or commit murder. So it's no surprise that she marries for convenience after she had married to make Ashley miserable and silence wagging tongues at Twelve Oaks. I felt sorry for her boys; she really was a mother only to her precious Bonnie. And how on Earth could she have loved a wuss like Ashley Wilkes when she had a grown man who loved her? I'd like to think that Scarlett O'Hara Hamilton Kennedy Butler got her man back after she returns to Tara. The land always gives her strength and regenerates her spirits. But I wonder if she realized too late that she loved Rhett and really belonged with him? Well after all, tomorrow is another day.",
            "I bought it for my kindle, because its summer and there will probably never be a better beach read or a better book ever anyway. Scarlett still steals your breath with her personality and Rhett still makes you swoon and this is still the best book I ever read.",
            "When I began this book, I began something that I didn't know how to end. I began a journey, and as this journey came to a close, I nearly came unravelled at the seams. I'm serious. This book is ruining my life a little bit right now, and I'm just not sure what my refractory period is after finishing a truly, devastatingly good novel that also breaks my heart.I will say this as a foreward to a very long and very emotional review- this book is quite problematic for me and I'm sure for many others as well. I am a girl born and raised in the North and there are some things, even fictional things, that I am uncomfortable with. That's just who I am. I absolutely applaud Mitchell on this masterpiece, but I also raise an eyebrow at her. There are offensive things in this book, mind you, and it takes awhile to get past them.We all know the basics of this 1,000 page Bildungsroman. Scarlett O'Hara, sixteen years old, the charming Southern Belle on her plantation Tara, blissfully ignorant and delightfully simple, devoted to her one true love, Ashley Wilkes, while courting several other \"beaux\" and enjoying her sweet life. Then the war comes, and then Ashley marries, then Rhett Butler appears, and suddenly, the novel begins, and I was swept away by its tide so fast I didn't know what hit me.My first reaction to Scarlett was overwhelmingly negative, which I'm sure is the common reaction. She is just so overwhelmingly simple. She cannot grasp scarcasm or irony or metaphor, she hates books, and she detests any talk of politics. And she prefers the chaste and simpering affection of men to any kind of female companionship, save for the love of her precious and doting mother Ellen. And for some unfathomable reason, she is absolutely devoted to Ashley Wilkes, a sappy pretty boy who is already engaged to be married. Scarlett is the protagonist I usually shut the book for. I don't identify with her, nor did I originally want to. She was cute, sure, and I was swept away by her first dance with Rhett, but I still didn't like her. Then, about 200 pages in, she becomes a heroine.I will always consider Scarlett O'Hara one of the bravest women I've ever read. She is strong, she is willful, and she does what needs to be done, no matter how unsuited she is for the job. When she had to help Melanie Wilkes give birth, sweet little Melanie whom Scarlett hated with fire, amidst burning Atlanta, I was on the edge of my seat. When she was abandoned by Rhett and had to fend for herself, Melanie, the baby, and her child, she just fought, and she survived. And I felt like there was hope for the rest of the story.Not only was Scarlett a heroine, she was a clever one. She married her second husband for money and used that money to make more money for herself, while presenting herself in \"unladylike\" ways, such as -gasp- leaving the house while pregnant! Quelle horreur! I loved this part because it wasn't just cheesy romance or adventure, it was relevant and interesting and very smart. Scarlett was blossoming, maybe not to others as much as she as to me. She was beginning to grow so multi-faceted. Now I have this strong, brave, brilliant woman, and what does she do? She breaks my little heart. All because of Rhett Butler.Rhett Butler was a conflicting character for me. To most women, he's a god. He's manly, rough, and a little dirty, but he also tries to know what women want and he loves hard and deep. But he's kind of a jerk and I go back and forth between loving and hating him. He doesn't take Scarlett seriously and he seems to think too highly of her reasoning skills, and I don't think those two ever really knew each other at all. Not to mention the fact that he probably raped her. He does redeem himself at the end, at least he mostly does, and then my heart ached so bad and I wanted things to be different so badly. I felt like I was the one who'd lost my chance. I was the one who didn't get my love, not Scarlett or Rhett. I hurt for them, for the evils they saw, for the harshness they lived, for the children and friends and family they lost. I was brought close to them and then I was torn apart. Mitchell made me love what could have been, and then when it wasn't, it was a loss that I am still recovering from.There are so many characters you fall in love with in this novel. Scarlett is probably one of the most multi-faceted characters I've ever read, and I think I love her. She is cold, powerful, manipulative, spiteful, delusional, childish, and shameless, but she is also hardworking, stubborn, idealistic, charming, hopeful, sensical, practical, and intensely brave. She grows in some ways and stays the same in others. She knows how to get what she wants and she knows how to stand up for herself, but when she learns a lesson, she learns it too late, and I just want to shake her. She is infuriating, but she is also infuriatingly real, and I will never forget her.Melanie is another character I will never forget. Her sheer devotion and faith and loyalty to Scarlett is achingly bittersweet, since she is used like Scarlett's puppet, but the scene of her death killed me. That is the only time Scarlett states her outward affection for Melanie and it was perfect. The bond they had was really interesting. I loved Will Benteen and Aunt Pitty and little Bonnie Butler.Now let me discuss why I am hesitant to discuss this novel with everyone. \"Gone With the Wind\" is unfathomably racist. I don't care if it was set in a time period. I don't care if it was the environment or the social commentary or even if Margaret Mitchell was racist or not, the language and characterization of the black slaves in Georgia is REALLY offensive. Like Alice Walker has said, white people use the altered way of writing a black person's speech to highlight that they truly know better and that it only makes the black characters look silly and uneducated. In novels with British characters, we don't use different spellings or exaggerated syntax. I HATE when white writers do that. It is embarrassing. I don't like it when people say that this novel was telling the story of the \"real south\", because it doesn't matter if it is real or not, it doesn't need to be glamorized. I'm glad Mammy is such a devoted person. I'm glad Pork is so proud of himself. But I hate that it is somehow attached to their status as slaves.Also, I'm pretty sure Rhett raped Scarlett. She ended up melting into him and enjoying his attention, but he would've done it whether she melted or not. I know that and I think Mitchell knew that. It makes it hard to love Rhett, but then again, there isn't an unconflicted character in this novel.Is this book problematic? Oh, yes. I completely understand the criticism and I won't hesitate to criticize it myself. But sometimes, problematic literature is also beautiful, and well-written, and emotional, and touching. This is one of those books. I will never forget this story. I am changed by it. I was reading it last night and when I read the part after Scarlett fell down the stairs and she calls for Melly but Melly can't come because Rhett is crying in her lap, I started crying. I really was crying because it was too much, and this is what the book does to your life when you set out on the journey to read it. Take the journey but pack a lot of provisions, and keep your mind open but sharpened, and let yourself enjoy it while still taking the time to think and reflect.Now, because I just have to- The girl I was before I read \"Gone With the Wind\" is truly gone with the wind.",
            "I read Gone with the Wind many years ago, so it was a pleasure to read it again. I only gave it 4 stars because I almost always wanted to have a \"talk\" with Scarlett. I am so glad she \"grew up\" finally at the end... a little too late, but better late than never. I loved the history that Mitchell sprinkles through the book. I also enjoyed seeing how some things never change. Such a pleasure to read.",
            "Only on page 328, but I am already obsessed! I have received little support in reading this novel. In fact, when I tell people I am reading GWTW each person has replied, \"Oh wow. I've never read it but I saw the movie. Such a great love story.\"To be honest I find myself annoyed! I could never imagine a movie that could substitute this book. And, yes, a love story, but just as well a historical narrative of the grueling life during the civil war through the mind of Scarlet. This leaves me to wonder how could a movie encompass the pages and pages of her thoughts? I am almost too afraid to see the movie for fear it will not live up to my expectations.Anywho... Amazing novel thus far. I highly recommend to those age 12+. In fact, my 16 year old, second cousin recommended it! I'm so proud of her!Best,Kim",
            "I wasn't quite sure whether I would enjoy Gone With the Wind. It's a large, forbidding book. But I loved it. Most of you are probably familiar with the basic story: the main character is Scarlett O'Hara, a spoiled southern belle in the time of the Civil War, and her desire to get everything she wants, through any means possible. A huge book, there are many characters in Gone With the Wind. Scarlett manipulates many men, but the ones she really cares about (Ashley, and later, Rhett), she can't. When she gets something she wants, she doesn't want it anymore. Scarlett is always frustrated, and is always making plans for the future. In some ways, this wasn't what interested me most about the book. I loved the setting. I just read A Soldier's Secret (admittedly, in a whole different class of literature), but anyway, that was from the Union perspective of things. In Gone With the Wind, none of the Southern ladies think that there's going to be a war. And when war does break out, they think that they're going to \"lick\" the Yankees in one battle. But the \"Yankees\" thought the same thing: that the Confederacy would be beaten immediately. Instead, we have a long, drawn-out, brutal, four year conflict.The Southern culture described in the book was interesting too. Among rich Georgia plantation-owners, there is a code of conduct, a certain way of behaving. The ladies can't say what they really think, a widow must wear black mourning clothes for years and never have any fun (Scarlett is in this predicament when she's only seventeen), etc. etc. Rhett Butler challenges all these things. He openly admits that he'd work for the North if he got paid more, he doesn't believe that the South will win, and he mocks the patriotic \"brave\" men of Georgia who fight. But at other times, he can be really cruel to Ashley. It was interesting to see how different life was among wealthy people back then.As for the characters, Scarlett is spoiled and used to getting her way, and she's from a slave-owning family, and yet...sometimes you sympathize with her. She genuinely cares about Ashley, she does have feelings, even though she's not very intelligent (though good at flirting with men.) Most of the deeper ideas expressed by some of the other characters go right over her head, and I was really frustrated by that. But my favorite character was probably Rhett. He's not afraid to challenge the system and say what he thinks, and he always seems to pop in the most convenient situations (for him, at least.) Rhett, when he meets Scarlett, makes her begin to challenge the way of life a bit. When he meets her, she's in mourning for a husband she was married to for two months and who she didn't care about. Only seventeen, she is desperate to be able to go to parties again, and he helps her do that. But he's complicated too. Underneath that mask, he's not as smooth. I think the white characters in the book were very well portrayed. Melanie, the wife of Ashley, is also a very sweet and kind woman, though she always misconstrues what Scarlett is thinking. Melanie always believes the best of people (which perhaps is not always wise), but that makes her a lovable character.However, you have to remember that the book was written in the 1920s and 30s, and set in the 1860s. There are plenty of stereotypes about blacks, and some derogatory words for blacks (darkies, the n-word). I find it very hard to believe that some of the slaves turned servants never wanted freedom, independence, or money. You just have to be aware that Mitchell is obviously very biased, and not believe everything she tells you.Gone With the Wind is a timeless classic and I would definitely recommend it to everyone. You can read Becky's excellent review of it here. Gone With the Wind does take some commitment as it is almost 1000 pages long, but it's a rewarding read.You can read all of my reviews at my blog, novareviews.blogspot.com.",
            "Perhaps you've heard of Gone With the Wind. In movie form, this work is quite stunning and fun. In print, it's breathtaking and provides bone-jarring visuals as well as a rich and well-developed story not often encountered.Mitchell's portrait of pre-during-and post Civil War South gives depth and intelligence to the people of the land, while simultaneously giving voice to their faults and well-intentioned geniality of that day and age.Characters like Scarlett, Rhett and Melanie gain personality that the movie does no justice. Although you know Melanie is going to die, when it finally hits, there's a true sadness that this rich personality we've traveled with is now leaving us. And in the end, Rhett still does leave Scarlett, but it's about more than not \"giving a damn\" and we feel sorry more for Rhett in this scene than for Scarlett (although we are glad that she finally gets it!)The characters almost disappoint as well, as they do everything we wish they wouldn't and do not behave as we want our characters to, thwarting their happy ending every step of the way. But Scarlett's real and honest love for Tara surrounds the novel and holds every element of the story together.In the end, there's only sadness upon finishing this novel in that there will never be a sequel by the late Margaret Mitchell, and perhaps even if there were there'd be no duplicating the magic that she created in this true and poignant work.",
            "I bought an original book 1936. I am just a little more then half way through the book. I'm so glad I didn't live back then. I wouldn't have been near the woman Miss Scarlet was. But when I was growing up I didn't appreciate history. That's why I wanted to read Gone With the Wind. Great history lesson. Sad but that was then",
            "Simply this. GWTW is one of the best books I have ever read. Never thought that would be the case, as I assumed it was just a book about romance and that's not mt preferred genre. But here is the unfortunate truth: while I was completely captivated with the book, I loathe the way it ends. It is like the author just got tired of writing it and decided to wrap things up quick with a few bittersweet insights. So, 99.9% of the book is five stars, the rest, being the very end, gets zero stars.",
            "Gone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell is a timeless classic. It is a wonderful tale that keeps you truly enchanted by the life of Scarlett O'Hara. Gone With the Wind takes place before, during, and after the Civil War in Georgia. It starts out at the beloved Tara, but soon finds itself in Atlanta. When Scarlett speaks of everything going on you can't help but feel the emotion she feels.At the beginning of the story, Scarlett wants Ashley as her husband. However, Ashley is to be married to Melanie, his musical and intelligently inclined cousin. Scarlett ends up marrying Melanie's brother, Charles, even though she still loves Ashley. He soon dies in the war and leaves her with a baby boy. After the war, Scarlett marries her sister's fianc&eacute;e to keep the Yankees from getting Tara. He later dies in a Ku Klux Klan raid and leaves Scarlett with a baby girl. A year later, Scarlett marries Rhett Butler and has a baby girl with him. Soon Rhett leaves Scarlett forever because she still loves Ashley and she needs to sort out her life.",
            "I love the movie so much that I just had to read the book. Now after reading the book I feel like the movie does not follow the book as well or as much as I thought it should. I think the book was a beautiful very complex story and I appreciate the language that is used. The time that the quthor used to explain the thoughts of the characters truly showed her love for each one.I enjoyed the highs and the lows of each character and there was no one that I loved or hated through out the book (except ashley) :). In a time where Twilight and Harry Potter are all that people want to talk about I once again appreciated the journey I took reading this book.#TeamRhett",
            "GWTW remains the classical view southerner's have always thought life was before the \"War of Northern Aggression\", as so many call the Civil War. While life in the \"big house\" was opulent for some, it was bought and paid for by the inhumane life of countless slaves. As a southerner who family never owned slaves - we were too poor!, I enjoy the fantasy that is GWTW, but always have a sickening feeling in the pit of my stomach knowing that the life Scarlett lived was nothing like the life of the average farmer's daughter. Just as the \"robber barons\" of the north enjoyed oppulent living from New York to Newport, society can not afford all for some and nothing for the many. By the way, the book is still VERY LONG!",
            "What can you say about a classic except for simply wonderful. The storyline, the characters, the descriptions of the old south. The civil war and it's horrors, the price you pay for decisions you make. Above all an amazing love story. A classic that will play forever.",
            "This classic story is classified as a Historical Fiction, but is a good review of the Civil War and about the early southern people of that century. I only wished I had paid more attention to my History Class as I found the story facinating. This is my third go around in reading Gone With the Wind. This time on my Kindle. It is one of the first books I have for my Kindle Library.",
            "Forget fifty shades of gray! This is a true love story. A story with meaning and feeling. Gone with the wind will burrow deep in to your heart.",
            "I read it to make my grandmother happy, but from the first pages to the end I could not stop reading! Amazing book!",
            "I've read this book a few times now. I always find something new. It is definitely a fascinating read no matter where you grew up. Margaret Mitchell's take on race relations is thought-provoking. Her characters cling to you years after reading it.",
            "It didn't take me long to figure the author was from the South. It painted a southern paradise that was destroyed by the North. However, I did enjoy the story line itself.",
            "What can i say? The book is better than the movie, but even though one cannot on screen (seeing the movie in any other media except the large movie theater screen will never be the same. For instance, the burning of Atlanta, does not and will never have the feeling and movement, and the right reaction on any other medium. Anyone who has seen this cannot disagree, I hope!Otherwise, I believe all has already been said on this, and I would not think Miss Mitchell would appreciate a review as long as her work which is set apart from all other literature. It IS in a class by itself! Thank you very much, WilesWales",
            "This has been my favorite book since I was a child. The book is so much better than the movie. I encourage anyone who has only seen the movie to make sure they read the book.The story starts out with a young Scarlett. She is a spoiled young woman who has never had to work for a thing in her life. She is different than many girls her age, because she thinks for herself. The setting is one where women were still property and a womans role in life was to be a wife and mother. Women didn't need any more ambition than that.Throughout the story, we watch as war changes Scarlett's life forever. Never does one scene happen in a battle, but you can feel the impact of the war in the various characters during the story. The author, Margaret Mitchell, gives us insight into the personal history of other characters in the book. This helps us to understand their motivations.The Scarlett in the book shows her human side more than the one in the movie. In the book it becomes obvious that Scarlett was doing the best she could to survive a terriable situation the world thrust upon her. In the movie, she seems like just a selfish b****. More than one scene in the book brings tears to my eye when I visualize what Scarlett was going through.",
            "My favorite book of all times. The description of the civil war helped me get a feel for what happened during those terrible times.",
            "It's remarkable to feel humbled by art, and that's what happened when I opened Gone With the Wind. I am humbled to be a reader of something so beautiful and full of intricacies that remind me what makes great literature, and moreover why it is so crucial.",
            "As good now as when I read it years ago. Everyone should read this at lest once in their life time.",
            "This book is amazing!! For a 1,000 page read it just zipped by....the plot was interesting, the characters very well described. I finished the book and watched the movie the same night. Neither one was a disappointment!!",
            "If you think this is chick lit, think again. Its thousand pages are so insightful a portrait, almost an expos&eacute;, of Cavalier society that I wonder at the book's popularity in the old Confederacy. It also sustains the lovely device of delivering the author's commentary through a pair of reverse-image channels, Ashley Wilkes and Rhett Butler, twins in their perceptions of the South but opposites in appearance and manner. The amazingly shallow Scarlett O'Hara carries on without quite noticing Ashley's and Rhett's joint narrative, flattering the reader's ability to see what she doesn't.Mitchell's portrayal of the races is as offensive as reality, which is saying a lot. Since we would rather that things had not been so and as we try to make them better it's useful having a baseline document like this, even though it can't properly imagine black slavery from the inside.About the last third of this long book changes tone as the author seems unable to maintain the same novelistic approach to Reconstruction as she did to the war. Mitchell's outrage boils over and the prose becomes somewhat expository.One cannot help being impressed by the continuation of that outrage for so many decades past the 1860s and 1870s. It prompts curiosity to learn more. Remember that Abraham Lincoln broke with the Republican Party late in his first term over post-war policy toward the South. As the GOP became the party of the Army (which it remains) it adopted a hard line that Lincoln rejected. Instead, Lincoln chose a southern (but anti-secessionist) Democrat as his running mate in 1864 under a \"National Union Party\" banner.What would it have meant, to blacks and whites, if Lincoln had been able to impose his own post-war policy? (And has any American ever faced decisions as awesome and consequential as did Abraham Lincoln?)Yet for all the book's historical and social interest in the end you can't around its marvelous sequence of set-pieces. Consider: Scarlett the pampered 19-year-old driving a dying mule and buckboard through the night and the following day amid the terrors of war with the lives of Melanie and her new-born constantly in the balance, only to emerge into her childhood world made desolate, her neighbors burnt out of their homes, her mother dead and her father helpless, her sisters ghostly from disease, broken soldiers roaming the land, and nothing to eat anywhere. How many of us can even grasp the idea of famine in an isolated rural area? Goodness gracious!Gone with the Wind leaves many images that will endure.",
            "If you loved the movie, you'll love the book. But be warned, the actual book itself (the hardcover published by Scribner) is shoddily made. The binding is falling apart and the pages are coming loose as I read it. I'm hoping it holds together until I'm finished reading it.",
            "This is a classic-- wonderful on so many levels and if you haven't read it then you owe yourself this treat. As a teen I was engrossed and ended up reading it several times over the years. ** small spoiler** As a younger person I always knew that Rhett came back to Scarlett. Later, when I got older, I was less certain that there was a happy ending for the pair and haven't read it since. But I still give it 5 stars because it is brilliant and beautiful and moving.",
            "I have read Gone with the Wind at least 10 times. Every time it is read, I find something missed previously. And every time I read it, it means something different to me. It has motivated me to read other books about that era of time and so I have learned a lot about the Civil War era and how important and significant it was for our country's history. I don't feel that the main thrust of the book was romance, but as in most lives, romance occurs some time, and the people of this novel also find some romance. Scarlett moves from one phase of life to the next with a realists mind except when it comes to Ashley Wilkes.All in all, it is a long book, but one that you won't forget.",
            "This book is a classic. One that I believe all southern women should read and pass down to their daughters. It is a story of love, loss, and an age in which we could never fully understand. That being said, this version's printing is not the best. On nearly every page, there are words or letters that are not fully printed. The hardcover, binding, and dust cover are in wonderful shape. The packaging and delivery, too, were outstanding. The only drawback I see is the printing not being 100% clear on each page. I think if you are interesting in purchasing a hardcover copy, you may wish to try a different version. I hope this is helpful.",
            "Well, I'm 41 years old and have finally read this classic! I'm so glad I read it! It will definitely go down as one of my favorites ever read. Margaret Mitchell is a genious writer who really made me feel like I was right there in the south with all of the wonderful characters!This book is filled with romance, war, politics, friendship, business dealings, deception and so so much more! Lots of characters that entertwine and so much fun to read!I couldn't put it down! It is a big book, but well worth it!Read it! Read it!",
            "Ageless story giving a digestable history of the the American Civil War, a feeling of what it was like to live at that time and an entrancing love story. Loved this edition too, good paper and easy size to hold for a long book.",
            "I read this book as a tween and loved it. I didn't know enough to be offended by Mitchell's whitewash of slavery. I hated Melanie and Ashley, and I loved Scarlett and Rhett, even though I thought Scarlett was some kind of a moron to have the hots for Ashley. When I became a novelist, I realized that my love/hate experience with the characters demonstrated just how crafty Mitchell had been in creating her characters because by then I'd met a bunch of readers who loved Melanie/Ashley and hated Scarlett/Rhett. Something for everyone? You betcha. And her \"I'll think about that tomorrow\" ending was also a brilliant move, equally satisfying to readers who want Scarlett to get Rhett back and those who don't.",
            "This is just such an enjoyable read. Scarlett is appropriately evil, and in the end redeemable.Wonderful novel. I intend to read this again very soon. I had not realized how much better the book is than the movie!",
            "One of my library students finally finished \"Gone With the Wind.\" She's my voracious reader, whom I allow to check out four, six books at a time. If anyone asks why she gets to check out that many books, she is to say: \"Because I'm special.\" It took her two years to read GWTW: she began it in the sixth grade, let it languish, then this year, as an 8th grader, she started over and read it through. Oh! Yes, she loved it!I first read the 1,037-page novel in the 8th grade as well. That was my first reading. I was severely disappointed with the ending. So I read it again and again, fully expecting each time that Rhett WOULD \"give a damn\" and return to Scarlet. This was not to be, at least, not in the annals of concluded fiction. Who hasn't read GWTW that didn't imagine Rhett returning?Just as in real life, fictional characters also behave according to their dictates (granted, their god is different from those of humans) and their circumstances. Would any self-respecting Rhett return to such a cold-hearted, well, you know how she acts and what she is. Even red-petticoat wearing Mammy scoffed at the idea of Scarlet actually winning either man: book-loving, milquetoast Ashley or hot-blooded, fiercely protective Rhett. One is too tame, the other too untameable.So, what is GWTW really: an historical novel of the South and its Lost Cause or a microscopic look at one woman and how she is both damaged and strenghtned by the War Between the States, which meant nothing more to her than an inconvenience. Is it both?Gone With the Wind, is, of course, both historical and character-driven. Two protagonists, Scarlet and Rhett, are pitted against each other, although both are attracted to each other, whether one knows it or not. Ashley is an unattainable dream, a wish fulfillment; Rhett is a hot rod used to prod Scarlet's sensibilities (which are not so sensible).Of course, the real heroine of the novel is Melanie, sweet, sweet Melanie, symbolic steel magnolia, who can kill an enemy in cold blood, yet defend her most erring sister-in-law. Loyal, devout, faithful, responsible, just keep on naming those lovely positive character attributes and you have Melanie. Does such a woman exist? Of course, she does. You and I both know women like Melanie. They run the churches--behind the scenes unless they're needed up front. Always there, always dependable, yet just a little sicky sweet.Scarlet. To the end, defiant. To the end, hoping for that rescue. To the end, just Scarlett. Oh well, we'll think about it tomorrow. Yes, tomorrow.",
            "GWTW, the great American epic, certainly earns its reputation by being a big sweeping novel of the collapse and rebuilding of the American south. Mitchell's research about the many battles in and around Atlanta is evident, as is her knowledge of Southern plantation and urban life. But despite all of her research, her personal bias is evident and clouds her recounting of history. Mitchell is a product of her times, Southern born and bred 70 years after the civil war. She believes that slavery was not so bad, and the slaves were treated like family and were protected and cared for. Her descriptions of free slaves in Atlanta makes one cringe, and she devotes half of chapter 37 to this narrative with quotes like, \"There they conducted themselves as creatures of small intelligence might naturally do. Like monkeys or small children turned loose among treasured objects...\" Another of her characters, Big Sam, a former slave on Tara has tried freedom and doesn't like it and is trying to make his way back to Tara where he knows he will be cared for again. Nowhere in the book does Mitchell make reference to the hard and inhumane lives slaves lived, and the fact that they were property with no rights or lives they could call their own. She even tries to justify the existence of the KKK, saying that the free blacks were running so amuck over of the whites that the Southern men, who had been stripped of their rights by the Yankees, had to do something to avenge these wrongs.Putting aside all of Mitchell's personal bias about slavery, I did enjoy this book and ultimately felt it was a many layered love story between Scarlett, Rhett, Melanie, and Ashley, all intertwined in matters of the heart. Scarlett, the central character and most interesting by far, is a modern woman ahead of her time. She is outspoken, strong-willed and a shrewd business woman. She does whatever it takes to get what she wants in affairs of business and the heart. She is a fully developed character with a range of emotions from pride and pettiness to compassion and understanding (although she tends to lean more toward the former emotions). At times we thoroughly dislike her, others we can relate to her, sometimes we pity her and occasionally we even cheer for her. Mitchell also spends time developing her other major characters, Rhett, Melanie and Ashley, and by the end we feel as if we really know all of them.Despite its 1,000 pages or 41 hours on audio cd, which I listened to, I never got bored, and in fact didn't want to end. The story always moved right along. Someone was always dying, getting married, having a baby, going to or planning a party, plotting, scheming, or getting into or out of trouble. It is melodrama at its best and I am so glad I actually read it instead of just seeing the abridged story in the form of the movie.",
            "wow. loved it. i will definitley be reading this book again and again. i always loved the movie but the book is simply amazing. such complex and interesting characters. its hard to believe the age of the book the style of writing seems ahead of its time. sorry for typos, on my kindle.",
            "I read this book the first time at the age of 13 and 10 years later I love it as much now as i did then. This story is an emotional rollercoaster that will make you hang onto every word. The characters are vibrant, the settings rich, and the tale a timeless one. The ultimate love-hate relationship story.",
            "he falls for a bad woman and thinks that she will turn good for him. But she does not. The latent goodness that he imagines never comes out. He does not mind her bad qualities and in fact admires them. But he does not want them applied to him, at least not all the time. He thinks she can separate them out and give him her good qualities, and just enough badness to make the relationship exciting. It does not work. It works only in romance novels, where the heroine falls for a rotter who is nice to her only while still remaining \"difficult\" but not too much. In this case, where the woman is the bad one (unusual), the author resisted the temptation to give us the happy ending.Rhett likes Scarlett both in spite of and because she is selfish, thoughtless, greedy, a bad mother, shallow, narrowminded, often ignorant and not wanting to learn anything, and lacking in self knowledge. She is also hypocritical, which is actually one of her good qualities. At least she acknowledges that there is something there in the world that is better than her, values superior to hers, characters better than hers, that she should at least pay lip service to. And it's not just lip service. She feels guilt and remorse. She wishes she was better. Let's not be too hard on hypocrisy. It keeps people from worse sins and it protects the innocent.What are her other good qualities? Determination, persistence, courage, shrewdness, resourcefulness, and loyalty to her family, and some notion of decency that keeps her from more seriously bad conduct.Rhett likes her. He finds her fascinating. He sees where she is vulnerable and loves her for that, too. He just wants that she would love him. But for her to do that she has to be a different person. Rhett falls into a classic trap, that the bad person will become good for the one that loves him. Scarlett is too foolish to realize what Rhett offers her, how valuable it is. One problem she has is not wanting to submit. He is willing to submit himself to the loved one, but she is not. She does not want to become dependent on anyone, seeing it as weakness. She is afraid of losing power. He will risk it but she won't.With Ashley, she will be the strong one. So she is not scared of Ashley. With Rhett, he is strong too. And he knows her and can see through her. That scares her. She can't put on airs with him. But Rhett although he teases her does not want to degrade her or change her, except to the extent she will love him. He is willing for her to go her own way. He just wants some honesty from her, so they can be comfortable together and have consensus, so they can get along day to day. He seeks it from the wrong person, however, because Scarlett is not honest about him, herself, or Ashley or Melanie. Rhett fails to see that a person like that cannot be honest with him either.Even at the end when she realizes it has been Rhett all along she still does not get it. She makes a contemptuous remark about Ashley. Rhett corrects her right away. No, he says, Ashley is not contemptible. Rhett is intelligent. He can respect things he does not share in or agree with. He can see the value of Ashley, though they are totally different characters. Scarlett, once she no longer is in love with Ashley, which she never really was, now despises him. She goes in the total opposite direction. That is typical of her and shows a small mind. It also shows that she never knew anything about Ashley. Rhett has a code of honor. Scarlett has no honor.Yet, we like her.If she was just a little more open minded she and Rhett would make a fine pair. If she could see Rhett for what he is, a ruthless harsh man with a code of honor and much kindness in him that he would lavish on her if given a chance. But she does not until it is too late and he has had it with her, with trying to give her love that she never would accept.It's one of the great love stories and the main reason, I believe, the book is still read.The other reason is the description of the old south and the reconstruction era. While I don't agree with all of the author's values, her writing is masterly. She makes you feel what those characters felt. She makes you sympathetic to people with totally different values from your own, which is no mean feat. The reader sees that the characters are wrong about slavery and race and the southern lifestyle, yet feels pity for them. The reader does not root for them to win, yet hopes that things will turn out well for them. When Rhett takes pains to ensure that his child will be accepted by the \"right\" kind of people, the old guard, you feel the same as he does, although you know that it is nonsensical. The old guard will die and it is well that it is so. But you admire Rhett for what he is doing. The book is a testament to the power of good writing, the power of art, the power of a good story. The book is compulsively readable. It is a good example of why we think art is dangerous.The author poured her passion into the book, the passion of the defeated south, and it all comes through on the page. Some parts of the book that go on and on about the south's wounds during reconstruction are tedious as well as historically not factual. For instance, it is not true that the freed slaves had all that power. But when she turns to what the characters feel, she makes you view them with sympathy, even love. The feelings in the book are genuine.",
            "My husband recently bought this copy for me when I showed him the copy I had one my book shelf... The one I have was printed in 1954. It had been read so many times that the spine was missing, pages were loose, some missing, pages stuck together, but I still kept reading it over and over.",
            "what I liked about gone with the wind:Lively description of pre- and post-civil war Southerners, mainly former plantation owners, who were left with no slaves and no money but still not surrendering.Scarlett O'Hara's bold way of overcoming the practical difficulties, even though it was sometimes unpleasant. But overall, to me, it was persuasive.Description of Scarlett's personality was really good and consistent. Thoroughly shallow and thorougly immature. (If there is any doctor or medical student in your family, please go and read about chapter of personality disorders in psychology book. I think Scarlett falls under the category of histrionic personality, as far as I can remember.)Other characters are also well pictured and attractive.Using Belle Watling as contrast to Scarlett, and also Melanie as contrast. Maybe Melanie would have made a better heroine.The end. I guess Scarlett cannot deserve an innocent happy end, but it was good to see that she recognized the truth about Ashley and Rhett at last, ironically via Melanie's death.what I hated about it:Justifying racism, especially KKK. Mitchell's point of view was really disturbing, even after making allowances for her as a pre-war Southerner from heart. OK, Scarlett was the heroine and she might have felt and thought that way pretty much. So Mitchell sticked to it.I agree that the significance of Civil War cannot be reduced to only one point, slavery issue, but Mitchell advocated for plantation owners too much.Rhett made peace with Southerners too easily, while with Bonnie. Also too romantically.Overall, it was good reading, but a little too romantic and inaccurate after all. Good mix of history and romance. If it were for only one of them, it would not have made such a hit. Plus, the force of characters. Mitchell did the best job about characters.",
            "Overall Rating: B+Like all books for which I see a movie adaptation first, I feel as though I was somewhat tainted by the movie. The book is similar though there are some discrepancies in the plot. These details (Scarlett O'Hara's other children by Charles Hamilton and Frank Kennedy, Will Benteen's involvement in Tara, etc) were good deletions from the book for the purposes of the movie production but, like all book to movie transformations, the extra details add an enormous amount of depth to the story.The prose is descriptive but, in parts, not as grand as I expected. Again, perhaps this is the taint from the movie but because the film was so beautifully produced, I expected the same feeling of grandeur from the text.Scarlett O'Hara is an incredibly interesting character; she comes off as a heartless and greedy but also shows an immense amount of passion. She isn't a likable character in most aspects but she does inspire a good amount of admiration for overcoming circumstances well beyond her control. Men play only a passing role for the most part; Rhett Butler is probably the most well developed male character but even he is predictable. Melanie Wilkes is the most pleasant surprise, showing more strength of will than was even broached by the movie. This is most certainly a character driven novel as there are long stretches of time in which very little action happens; on the other hand, there is so much to digest in the last few chapters I felt as though I was always a little behind.There are a few sequels/alternate story lines but, honestly, I'm not interested in the least. I enjoyed the story but it didn't inspire the obsession for me that it has for others.I always try to appreciate the context of language and story when I'm reading story set in another time. That being said, I couldn't help but cringe at the blatant racism displayed in a matter-of-fact way in the story. Racial epithets are frequent throughout the book and the ignorance and idiocy of the slaves/former slaves is taken at a given. This isn't to say it isn't an important part of the book as it was the sentiment of the times but, still, a little hard to listen to at times.I would recommend this to anyone who has a great love of the movie or for those who enjoy long, sweeping epics. In audiobook form, its an enjoyable listen but it is quite a slog.Audiobook Details:The reader, Linda Stephens, had a good balance of accents (she even sings the songs included in the book) and voice depth for the male characters. As much as I enjoyed her reading, the length of the book was so long it would have been refreshing to hear a few other voices. The number of characters in the book is small enough that this would have been an excellent cast production.I didn't recognize any of her other work but I would recommend her as a reader if you enjoy obvious voice acting.Run time was 49 hours, 7 minutes.Published By Recorded Books",
            "This book is wonderful! In history classes we always heard the Civil War from the North's perspective but this book gives us a glimpse into the South's feelings and the changes undergone there. But my favorite part about this book is the descriptions, the plot, the well-developed characters, the language of the times, and especially Scarlett herself. You won't be sorry you read it!",
            "I was reluctant to read Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind because I thought it was basically a romance novel. It is not. It includes some very appealing characters and lots of action.The focus of the novel is on Scarlett O'Hara. She is a magnificent creature, beautiful and strong, but she is completely defined by her selfishness. When she is a fresh young woman, her selfishness is actually appealing - at least to Rhett Butler, a rogue who appreciates anyone who flaunts conventional morality. As time passes, though, Rhett matures and Scarlett does not, and her selfishness has more serious consequences.The plot moves quickly through a series of exciting episodes: battles are won or lost, men and women fall in love, babies are born and soldiers die. The author maintains suspense as we await the defeat of the Confederacy but of course the result is never in doubt. At the end of the war, genteel Southern society collapses and is replaced by coarse commercialism and opportunism. The aristocracy is ruined and its members are forced into trades. Against this backdrop, we watch the romance between Scarlett and Rhett Butler develop and then wane.Mitchell depicts the antebellum South as a happy society with a place for everyone, from the planter aristocracy down to the slaves who thrive under their paternalistic care. This depiction is affecting but obviously idealized. Many subsequent passages of the book, dealing with racial relations during the reconstruction, are even more offensive to African-Americans. Mitchell wrote Gone with the Wind 70 years ago and her views on race are not modern ones. Still, there is no denying her ability as a writer, and there is no denying that Gone with the Wind is a great novel.",
            "\"Gone with the Wind\" by Margaret Mitchell is one of my favorite books of all time. Scarlet O'Hara, the foolish southern belle is in love with Ashley Wilkes, a scholar who won't have anything to do with her. To rebel, she marries his fianc&eacute;e' s brother and when the war breaks out, it turns ugly. She is then forced to move to Atlanta to her husband's house. In Atlanta, Georgia during the Civil War things aren't easy. It is hot and sandy. The sticky humidity is horrible to live in yet the feeling of \"home\" is evident everywhere. There are always barbecues and lazy afternoons up till the war. The south is mostly cotton fields, with little factories while the north is full of manufacturing. Things don't look too good for the south when the war breaks out and to make everything worse, the ports are soon closed off. All too soon Scarlet feels the bitterness of war as her childhood friends die for a losing cause. When she finds Atlanta being attacked by General Sherman she must flee for safety and there is nowhere to go.This story is about a girl who has been spoiled her entire life and then must learn to do things on her own. She faces the fact that she can't have everything and that she has to make sacrifices. Her whole life she has been the brat that depends on everyone else so she can't do anything on her own. She is blinded by her own insolence to the truth that nothing is fair. Sweet Melanie, her sister in law is kind to her and is too sweet hearted to see the wrong in anyone; she doesn't see how corrupt Scarlet' s mind is. She is always on Scarlet' s side despite the horrible things that she does. Scandalous Rhett Butler loves Scarlet for her foul heart and chases her throughout the whole book. Rhett has a history for doing unthinkable things to girls. (Unthinkable at the time; refusing to marry a girl he courted, publicly kissing, etc.) Everyone despises him for making a profit off of the war. All proper people support the failing cause and Rhett makes fun of them. He is a businessman, so nothing is personal till he meets Scarlet. As time progresses, Scarlet comes to realize the damage that she has done with her being wicked to everyone. She literally is and was a spoiled brat. Her suffering teaches her a lesson that we all should learn.If you love historical fiction with a little romance, this book is perfect for you. Scarlet is the perfect Southern belle who is incredible to read about. How she attracts men with her charm and little helpless acts is unbelievable. She is used to having slaves serve her and she treats them with little or no respect until she needs them. You cannot stop thinking about how much you would hate Scarlet if she was real, but you can't stop feeling sorry for her and you want to help her to realize how stupid she is.In this book you have a look at how the south was before and after the Civil War. They were still people with feelings, not horrible people who were wicked. You fall in love with the chivalry and way of life. You also realize how wrong slavery was. Even they knew it was wrong, they just couldn't imagine life without the slave labor. I think that the book is written well, you see why people did things and the reasoning behind their actions. I didn't always agree with what Scarlet did, but I knew why she did things. The book is very interesting and I couldn't put it down at all. I certainly would recommend it to just about anyone. I certainly understand the era better now. The book got me interested in other books about the war and now I can see why people felt the way they did. I can see the good and bad in slavery. I feel that lack of education on the issue is what caused such disastrous effects.",
            "When I first got GWTW to read and saw how long it was I said to myself this is going to be bad and take forever to read, but I went on to read it not knowing why. Many of my friends thought I was crazy reading it, and frankly so did I. Well I started to read it and really got into it. It was so exciting and thrilling I never wanted to put it down. The story of Scarlett O'Hara really touched me and made me realize everthing that we take for granted in life. Also how if you want to be noticed in life and be remembered than be different. Scarlett did many bold things during the war, and even though she had trouble keeping husbands she finally fund a true love one whom she thought she hated. This book was full of surprises and throughly heart warming. It will make any reader make his or her outlook on life so much better, and give them more hope in a &quot;wacky&quot; and strange world like ours.",
            "Last Christmas, I received Gone With The Wind, and before I even went back to school, I had finished it. I read it all day for a week, and when I finished, I felt like my heart had been squeezed. It was so amazing. I have persuaded friends to read it, have posters of it hanging in my room, and simply love it!!! This is one of my favorite books!!!",
            "Just finished reading all the reviews people posted on GWTW and I'm overwhelmed by the love people have for this book. I'll admit it's not my all time favorite (that honor belongs to By Love Possessed, by James Gould Cozzens), but GWTW is still one of the greatest literary experiences a person can have. It's the type of book one simply disappears into, you have no concept of the outside world--your world is Tara, Twelve Oaks, Atlanta, and your friends are Scarlett, Rhett, Melanie, Ashley, et al. You forgive them their indescretions and love them for their humanity. Oh, and I hated the Alexandra Ripley sequel.",
            "I love this book. It is so heartbreaking, tragic, and romantic- it just kind of draws me to it. One of my best friends took three years to convince me to check it out of the library. Finally I did and I wish now that I hadn't waited so long. I'm 13, and I think this book is awesome, and I don't even like romances, and I haven't even finished it yet!!!! This is a must-read for anyone with a flair for the dramatic, and anyone who doesn't like it can just shut their mouths!!!",
            "The thing that stands out the most in my mind is how different it was from the movie. All the little extra things that happen in the book that don't happen in the movie (i.e. Scarlett has more than 1 child) Anyone who loves the movie owes it to themselves to read the book. Don't be put off by the number of pages. You'll come away thinking, Gee I only knew 1/2 the story!",
            "WOW. Possibly THE BEST book I have ever read. My mother took me to see th rerelease just recently at a theater in Dallas, and when it was over I didn't want to leave. I mean, the movie was 6+ hours long and I still wanted more!! So I went and bought the book. My favorite part has to be(besides the fall of Atlanta)the ball in which Rhett auctions Scarlett. It is a perfect example of their feelings for each other. I love all the characters. Timid Melly, Rash Scarlett, Careless Rhett. A must read!!!!",
            "This novel has it all! Where else can you read about love, honor, tradition and free enterprise? Given that she is a woman with charm, beauty and brain's, it's no wonder that the men in her life naturally &quot;flocked&quot; to her. I have read GWTW several times, and I still find myself more enthralled each time. I admire Scarlett's survival instinct, and her raw ambition. GWTW will forever be a timeless american classic!",
            "This is a timeless movie, people of all ages love it. I love the ending, it makes you use your own imagination on what happens after Rhett leaves. The so-called sequel was the biggest mistake the Maragret Mitchell estate could of ever made. As far as I am concerned, that book was no sequel, but a seperate book altogether. They can say whatever they want about Titanic, but let's see if it can last half as long as GWTW.",
            "What can you say about this novel? The prose evokes comparison to Edith Wharton's. The characters live and breathe before you on the page. The setting is set in intimate detail, and it swirls in your mind's eye as you drink in the words. Amazing novel. Scarlett seems much stronger in literature than her flighty character in the film. Once I could escape my preconceived notion of the characters taken from the film, the book became pure joy to read.",
            "Gone With The Wind is a great book,about a young girl, Scarlett, who is a terrible flirt. I read it this summer and I'm only nine, the context wasn't too challenging. M.M. wove the story plot extremely well,it kept me in suspense until the very end, and I want to read the sequal. All in all , if I could, I would give this book infinity stars.",
            "Mind blowing! The book was amazing!! One of the best experiences of my life was reading it. The movie did not do anything much tho' the casting was superb. The sequel was pathetic, Alexandra Ripley: go boil your head! You're nowhere near the real thing!",
            "Gone With the Wind is, without a doubt, my one and only obsession. Since reading it at age 10, I have attempted to acquire everything that I have found to be associated with this extrodinary book. I am now 16 and my love for Gone With the Wind is still exceedingly strong. Alexandra Ripley's so-called sequel was good but her Scarlett and Rhett did not suit the originals. Margaret Mitchell was a superb author with a genious for portraying saucy, touch-me-not characters like Scarlett and smooth,arrogant ones like Rhett. Throughout the book Scarlett's insistance that she would always love Ashley and Rhett would never have that privilege perfectly led up to the ending where she finally realizes that she only wanted Ashley because she could not have him. Gone With the Wind is the best book ever written and in my mind that fact will never change.",
            "This is the best book in the world. If you haven't read it, you have to! This book is so real. You feel for Scarlett and cry with her and laugh with her. It's to hard for me to write in words how wounderful this book is. You have to read it to fell and understand it. If I were you I would drop everything and run to the store and buy, buy, buy it!",
            "When I first picked up Gone With the Wind, I thought that I would be reading it for the rest of my life. To be true, it only took a few weeks to finish and it was the one of the best books I have ever read. I thought that Margaret Mitchell was perfect in her way she described the Civil War with a romantic twist with it. I ended up reading this book for my Honors English class and it was worth every minute of it.",
            "'Gone with the wind' is one of the greatest love stories ever written. It has withstood the test of time and has emerged as a novel, absolutely unforgettable. I am not even American, yet Mitchell's art of writing and the vivid and real-like descriptions enrapture the reader's imagination crossing all regional boundaries. This book has to be bought and not borrowed, to enjoy its splendour completely.",
            "This has got to be one of my favorite books. Historically accurate and breathtakingly written, you get a real feel for what it was like to live in the Antibellum South. I actually finished the book thinking how much I hated Scarlett as a character, but her journey through life was a magnificent ride. I was actually glad that this book was so long, as I turned page after page and didn't want it to end. It's an accomplishment to finish such a lengthy work, but it was well worth the effort. I love this book.",
            "Gone with the wind was one of the best novel i have read so far. The story was so excited and you can't just quit reading it.It holds your emotions through out and you'll never get bore. The character of Scarlet O'Hara was the dominant one in the story but i don't understand why she always behave Rhett badly when he always loved her so much. The most sympethatic character was of Melanie who dies at the end; and she was the one who was taking caring of every body in the home. Ashely character was not bad but i don't know why he always think about the old south. Overall the story is the best.",
            "I simply love this book! I read it when I was 14.Its still the best I've ever read.I'm now 45. The film was good (seen it more than 5 times) but the book is even better. The sequel was a disappointment, the film Scarlet even worse. Nobody could ever write and feel like Margaret Mitchell.",
            "One of the richest books I have ever read. The story completely snares you until the last page, and even when you've finished you will find yourself thinking about it. For anyone who wants an explosion of a story and an outstanding mixture of characters, this novel will always be amoung the top suggestions...",
            "I first read this book at age 13 only cause it was required reading for an English class. I ended up reading all night and was wiped the next day in school. It's impossible to put down.Now 25 years and many thousands of books later it is still my favorite book. I get so mad at Scarlett, we should all be so lucky to find a Rhett and she doesn't appreciate him! Still makes me cry.",
            "ONCE YOU PICK IT UP, IT'S SO HARD TO PUT DOWN. ITS AS IF YOU BECOME SCARLETT O'HARA HAMILTON KENNEDY BUTLER'S SHADOW. AS IF YOU BECOME A PART OF HER LIFE. THIS STORY MADE A WONDERFUL MOVIE, BUT YOU HAVE TO READ THE BOOK IN ORDER TO REALLY UNDERSTAND SCARLETT, RHETT, MELANIE, AND ASHLEY. PLEASE DO TAKE THE TIME TO READ THE MOST INTERESTING AND WONDERFUL BOOK OF ALL TIME.",
            "This book was so great, that i can not even verbalize the impact it had on me. The 1000 pages plus was a little intimidating, but after page 1000, I wanted there to be another thousand pages!!",
            "I first read Gone with the Wind in high school...now many years later (and many books later) it is still my favorite. I've read it five or six times. There is nothing like it. It's better than the movie and really packs an emotional punch. Just beautiful.",
            "THE FIRST TIME I READ THE BOOK, I KNEW WHY IT HAS BEEN AROUND FOR SO LONG. IT MADE ME FEEL AS IF I WERE THERE, WATCHING ALL OF THE ACTION.",
            "There are only two negative things about this book:1. You can only read it for the first time once2. It's not long enoughExcellent book. It broke my heart.",
            "Gone with the wind is the best love story that i have read in my seventeen years here on earth.",
            "Gone With the Wind is my absolute favorite novel. It has great storylines with something for everyone. I read it over and over. It should be required reading for everyone.",
            "gone with the wind is a beautiful story that brings smiles, laughs, gasps, sorrow, tears, joy, and pictures in your mind that are so real, you start to see, smell, taste, feel, hear, and be the story. It is beautifully written, so that it becomes real. Gone with the wind is perhaps the most beautifully written story of all times.",
            "I love this book, because it's so romantic and so classic. You'll never get tired of this book. And it just keeps on going. But even though it's so long, it ends way too soon!",
            "If you've seen the movie but haven't read the book you have to. It gives you a totally different idea on some things than the movie does. The sequel is ok but nothing could be as good as the orginal!",
            "This book took my breath away ... Margaret Mitchell has painted such an unforgettable character in Scarlett 'O'Hara that even after finishing the book ,u can't decide whether to despise her / admire her ... not once in the book ,does Scarlett think an unselfish thought -her motives are always totally selfish -either for herself / for Tara -her childhood home [ which in effect is because she loves it passioantely!} --- the way she twists men around her little finger even the worldly wise &amp; cynical Rhett Butler in the end --- the slow &amp; inevitable change from the coquettish &amp; beautiful 16 year old Southern Belle to the hard as nails &amp; embittered yet still beautiful woman --- her relationship with her angel-like sister-in-law whom she loves to hate but yet ultimately fails to --- her wild passion for Ashley that destroys her judgement where men are concerned &amp; nearly destroys her ---which when the mask finally falls is revealed as mere lust on his part &amp; infatuation on her part --- her unrecognised till its too late love for the charming yet crude Rhett --- Only Scarlett's self- absorption remains constant...! Margaret portrays all this so beautifully &amp; so vividly that u completely lose yourselves in the 'O 'Hara family &amp; their trials in the war ...&amp; Scarlett --- the girl with the world at her feet who goes through life refusing to be true to anyone but herself &amp; the woman she becomes so hardened by disillusionment &amp; poverty that she starts forgetting the feminine ways essential for a true lady in those times ... she lingers in your mind long after ...&amp; U can never really decide whether she got what she deserved/ deserved what she got...As a hugely popular classic ,it definitely lives up to its fame ...Certainly worth a read!",
            "This is the best book I have ever read in my entire life. It was excellent, nothing like I thought it would be. Very, very good.",
            "It was a very descriptive book, the costumes, the characters, the scenery, all came to life. A true romance, and not excessive love-making on every page. Rhett and Scarlett were truely meant for each other, but she didn't know it. It's so true.",
            "I read &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; when my friends were reading the sequel. It was definitely the best book I've read yet. I'm reading the sequel, &quot;Scarlett&quot; now and all the characters seem so real. I got angry at Rhett when he left Scarlett, I cried when Melanie died. If you've never read it, read it soon!",
            "Best book of all time. Period.",
            "This book has everything that is needed for a great work of literature. The characters are compelling and believable, the plot and setting are exciting, and the language is just flowery enough to set off the book nicely. Scarlett is a vivacious character, and although I don't really respect or admire her I think she has a monolithic personality. I am so different from her that I find her reactions to the various situations she encounters highly entertaining. My favorite character is Melanie, because she is so like me. I can believe what she says and does and understand her because I would do the same thing usually. Rhett Butler gets on my nerves, though I think he's supposed to. He switches between acting gentlemanly and being a scoundrel. He doesn't know how to treat a lady-- or rather, a woman who isn't exactly a lady. The other characters I don't pay as much attention to, but I enjoy reading about every one of them. One of my first reactions to this book was that it really is perfect for a movie. Some of the descriptions paint a detailed and beautiful picture in my mind, and I read parts of them over and over. I haven't quite finished the book yet, but I have already recommended it to most of my friends, and I shall think of it as one of the greatest-- if not the best-- books I have ever read.",
            "This book is wonderful! It is the best classic ever written! Scarlett, a young lady growing up during the Civil War, struggles through many things. The hardships she faces are unbeleiveable! She has three husbands- Hamilton, Kennedy, and Butler. SHe ends up divorcing them all. There are many sad events in the bood, but there are also some happy moments. This book is a must read!",
            "Without a doubt, the best book ever written. I really felt like I was there, no, not even- I felt like I was her. I could understand what she thought, and would say, even if i thought she was a horribly selfish, blind little fool. The only real merits she had was being able to stick to something and get it, and to survive awful things. I was embarrassed for her,I could see the love that Rhett had held out to her, and wished I could tell her before she ruined the lives of everyone around her, not only herself. I felt the love that Melly had for her, and I wished I could be like Melly. The first 5 times I read it,in 7th grade, I cried really hard. Now, in 9th grade, I'm still it's biggest fan. My friends all think I'm obsessed, and maybe I am, but I love this book!!. Alexandra Ripley never should have tried to write a sequel, because it didn't match the facts, or what we knew of the characters. Scarlett may have chased after Rhett, without a doubt that's what she'd do, but she wouldn't go and have affairs with people, and Rhett wouldn't have married Anne. Anyway, what I'm trying to say, is that this is the best book, anyone who hasn't read it is missing out, and anyone who didn't like it is crazy!",
            "This is the best , I live in the south and I get very upset when I hear people say ,oh that book just show's what slavery was all about . That is when you know that, they have not read it. You would have to blind to not know that it's all about a very strong woman. It's wonderfully written .",
            "When I was twelve, I approached Gone with the Wind with reverence because I had repeatedly heard that it was the best novel ever written. A few days later, I closed the book on the last page, and all I felt was letdown. This is perhaps the greatest danger to succumbing to hype.Gone with the Wind is interesting and certainly very readable (I've read it several times since). Scarlett O'Hara is like Becky Sharp, mostly unlikeable, but still admirable for her gutsiness.While reading the book, it began to dawn on me that most of the gush over Gone with the Wind that I'd heard was about the movie rather than the book itself. I went to see the movie. I was appalled; the casting of the four main characters just didn't seem to fit. I already had a fixed notion in my mind of what the characters were like so probably no actors could meet my expectations. If I had read the book or seen the movie without any expectations, possibly I would've liked them better.",
            "I first read this book while in high school and I still love it 30 years later. It is also a great book for history of the civil war. It is an way for people not southerners to find out how the war was for the south.",
            "Selfish, sought after, sixteen-year-old Katie \"Scarlett\" O'Hara has everything a Southern Belle could want as the story begins in April of 1861: a loving family; a plethora of attentive suitors, and a lovely home on a plantation situated 25 miles from Atlanta, Georgia, maintained by the family's (p 279) hundred slaves. She soon learns that the primary object of her affections, Ashley Wilkes, is to about to announce his engagement. And before you know it, she has professed her love to one man, encountered another (Rhett Butler) for the first time, become engaged, married, pregnant and widowed. Meanwhile, most of the local males have become Confederate soldiers, battling on the side of the South in the Civil War. As the locals mourn their dead and the battles rage on, Scarlett chooses to return to Tara. After surviving a harrowing journey, she learns the fate of her family and home, and takes on roles of caregiver, operations manager, and manual laborer for the plantation along with its remaining inhabitants. She marries, again with ulterior motives, and moves to Atlanta, where her behavior as sole businesswoman starts tongues wagging. One wonders, will she ever find love?When the story ends, twelve years later, the war is over and many of her loved ones have passed. While she learns a few things about friendship, family, love, and loss, some things never change, like her feelings (contempt and disdain) about slaves and beliefs about slavery (better for them than their freedom). With its racist rhetoric, negative stereotypes, and inflammatory words for blacks (the \"n\" word alone appears ninety times), it is a lesson on the incomprehensible capacity of humans to justify their infliction of suffering on others and will likely cause many readers to squirm. But it is also a masterful epic on life and love in the South during the Civil War, with great character development and spectacular writing (including some neat old, odd words) which make it a worthy read from start to 700-plus page finish.",
            "Some of the reviews are long but I will keep this short. Gone With the Wind is the only book I have read twice. I absolutely adored this book and all the characters in it. It is my favourite book of all time and I read all sorts. I bought my mother and sister-in-law a copy because I thought they should read it too (just once). Read it and see for yourself.",
            "I first read this novel the summer I was seventeen. It is a novel that has been handed down in my family for three generations -- and now I know why.Scarlett O'Hara is a spoilt flirtacious southern belle on her father's rich plantation. All the other girls in the county hate and depise her because she has a way of getting her charming claws into their men -- ALL of the men, that is, except \"the long suffering Mr. Wilkes.\"Ashley Wilkes is young, blonde, handsome -- and taken. He is destined to marry Melony Hamilton -- the only woman in the county besides Scarlett's mother who doesn't depise her (ironically enough).Scarlett convinces herself she is in love with Ashley Wilkes, but the truth is she only wants him for the simple reason that she can not have him. Her want becomes an obsession that spans over the next four years of the Civil War and even after. Ashley turns her down in more than one entertaining love scene, one of which is over heard by none other than the the famous Rhett Butler.Rhett Butler is smitten by Scarlett the moment he first sees her because he recognizes in her the same qualities he values in himself: he is a social outcast without clean spot on his reputation. According to the South's unwritten social laws, he is not a gentleman but a scallywag and a cad because he refused to marry a girl he'd taken out without a chaperon. But Rhett is fearless and defiant when it comes to social rules and lives a comfortable life safely outside of \"good\" Southern society which means he openly associates with prostitues and therefore, knows about women's undergarments (something a man is supposed to pretend not to know about).But Rhett's sudden and adrent spark of love for Scarlett is doused somewhat when he learns of Scarlett's apparent love for Ashley Wilkes. He then spends the greater part of the novel fruitlessly pursuing Scarlett and trying to make her forget about Ashley. He married her, saying with a laugh that he \"can't wait all his life to catch her between husbands.\" But Rhett soon finds after the birth of their first child that married life with Scarlett is hell. He can't make love to Scarlett knowing that she's sighing for Ashley Wilkes, and he can't bear to sit across from her at supper anymore knowing that she wants Ashley there. And when Scarlett turns Rhett from her bed it hurts him so that he's driven to mad drinking.And though Scarlett moons after Ashley and fantasizes about him, she slowly but surely falls in love with Rhett. But here's the twist: once Scarlett realizes her love for Rhett and runs to him to proclaim it, she finds that Rhett's deathless love has, well, died, and that he just doesn't \"give a damn\" anymore.This is probably my favorite part of the movie version. I love when Scarlett runs through the mist to find Rhett at home, sitting listlessly before the window with an open suit case on the bed. I must've watched the ending more times than the rest of the movie put together. But nothing moves me more than Scarlett and Rhett's last parting words:\"Rhett! If you go, where shall I go, what shall I do?\"\"Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.\"",
            "THIS IS MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE NOVEL!! I don't care if I sound obsessed; I AM! Sure, I could offer the same criticism that others give (Mitchell was racist, Scarlett was a brat, the ending stunk), but regardless. I'm looking at the bigger picture here. WHAT A SAGA.Scarlett--though I admit, she was a witch sometimes---is truly admirable. She personifies the concepts of tenacity and perseverence, refusing to give up. I look up to her for being fierce, strong, opinionated, and a feminist. She was brave and ardent, and I love her.I forgive Mitchell for being racist in her writings, because she was most accurately portraying that time period. Honestly, I forgive any fault of the book, it was just so good!The conclusion...eh. I would have ended it at the end of the second-to-last chapter. But I'm not the author, I have no room to talk. She did a brilliant job illustrating the lives of members of the Confederacy, so lets give her proper credit and not denounce her.What else is there to say? These online reviews couldn't encompass it all, BY FAR. The novel was just delicious. I ate it all in less than two months' time (and it's a hearty meal, believe me). It surpasses the movie in my opinion, but both are exquisite masterpieces. READ IT READ IT READ IT READ IT!",
            "Gone With The Wind. Those immortal words are etched into the brains of generations. With those words come the acclaim and popularity it earned. To me, it was nothing more than a book. The swriting style of Margaret Mitchell is wonderful and I think that she brings authenticity to her work. That and only that is why i gave it four stars. Many of my female peers fell in love with the book. Maybe it was meant to be a feminine novel, not written for the eyes of a young man such as myself. It took me longer than most books to read and when I had finished it it left me with no sense of awe or despair at not having a decent sequel(which I am told is terrible). No, it left my with only one thought &quot;I wonder if I wasted my time.&quot;The story follows the majority of the life of Scarlett O' Hara, a ruthless southern belle, whose dellusions of love lead her to keep her foothold in the world. During her travels (or should I say misadventures?), she comes across a man named Rhett Butler. Rhett is a smart, dark, and deceptive character who flaunts his wealth and charm. He would have to be my favourite character because, as is so uncommon tday in literature, his character was believable and dark. His openness with his shortcomings and his lifestyle give him a sense of nonchalance that is a credit to Mitchell's style. However this is where my enjoyment stopped. The story seemed to drag unnecessarily and I did not speed through it as I thought I would when i heard how &quot;wonderful&quot; it was. The storyline was relatively simple and easy to understand, but it just does not gain my utmost appreciation as a classic in literature.",
            "This is the most absolutely wonderful book that was ever written! Margaret Mitchell truly makes you feel as if you were living in the Old South. This timeless novel has absolutely everything and anything that you could want in book- danger, fantasy, nightmares, dreams, lost loves, romances, daring heroines and heroes, villains, beauty, history, architecture, culture,... I could go on forever! I fell in love with Scarlett and Rhett the first time I read it. Yeah for the Confederacy!",
            "Gone With The Wind gives whoever reads it a very good story but it also teaches you a lot about the Civil War. The story starts at the beginning of the Civil War and it follows the life of Scarlett O'Hara for around 12 years. She is 16 at the beginning of the book.For about ten years of her life she thinks she loves Ashley Wilkes, only to realize that she had never loved Ashely and had tricked herself into thinking she did. At the beginning she tries to get Ashley to marry her instead of his fiance, when he doesn't, she marries Charles Hamilton.Throughout the story she and everyone around her loses everything that was dear to them. Almost everyone lost immediate family members in the war and Scarlett's mother , Ellen died from a fever and her father died after being crazy following Ellen's death. Scarlett struggled for a long time trying to keep her plantation, Tara, together. Scarlett and her family nearly starve for a long time until a man named Will helped them with the farming.Then, Scarlett married her sister's fiance for his money. He died a short while after. The night after his death, Rhett Butler, a man that the town hates because he was a scalawag, asked Scarlett to marry him. After a while she said yes. Within a few years, Scarlett gives birth to a baby girl and Rhett Butler loves her more than anything else. Scarlett loves her, but she never shows it, so Rhett raised Bonnie one his own. Everything is fine until it takes a turn for the worse. Bonnie dies and Melanie Wilkes, Ashley's wife dies. It was then that Scarlett realized how much she loved Melanie and it was then that she finally got her life straightened out.Overall, I think that Gone With The Wind is and excellent book. I would recommend it to highschool students.",
            "What else can be said about this great American epic? The classic coming of age book for many girls here in the South when they turn thirteen, it contains the whole story of the War Between the States amid a compelling love story. You will be glad when you read the book that you don't live in a time when you had to be in mourning for seven years. But, you will miss the era when honor, cause, and respect where such important issues.",
            "Even my husband enjoyed this one! This novel is the perfect combination of romance and action! If you have only seen the movie you haven't gotten the rest of the story! Once you read this one you will be hooked and Scarlett will have to be next! Enjoy!",
            "Since childhood I've been a great fan of books and have read many. I've been a particular fan of classics in particular and Gone With the Wind is on of my favorites! What more can I say than has already been said? As an avid reader and a future published writer, I recommend it to anyone who loves reading!",

            "This is my favorite novel ever! Wonderful historical background and wonderful characters, especially Scarlett, Rhett, and Melanie. If you liked the movie, but have never read the book, you will love the book. There are so many more details and events that occur in Scarlett's life in the book that aren't included in the movie. Even though the book is long, I have read it many times and love it just as much each time.",
            "This book is truly a part of my soul...it's my favorite & I absolutely love it! Five is not enough stars!",
            "1937, this renown title won the Pulitzer Prize. Seventy years later the novel retains the power to enthral audiences who have seen the movie time and time again. It remains a classic for all time.Always worth a reread, the acute observations into human nature and the power of history remain in the mind long after you put the book back on yourself.Nash Black, TRAVELERS and SINS OF THE FATHERS.",
            "This book sold 4 Million copies in one week! Then it was made into a movie which stayed in theaters for 30 years. No story ever told can compete with this one. It is just as compelling now as it was all those years ago and will remain so indefinitely.",
            "There is no excuse not to read this book. It is amazing and would be loved by all who read it.",
            "Or at least finest I've come across. Perfect in every respect. Demands to be read from cover to cover as quickly as possible. A finer contemporary drama you will not find.",
            "This is by far the best book I have ever read!! I loved Ms. Mitchell's vivid descriptions and her enchanting characters. You just can't go wrong buying this book!!!",
            "This has to be the best book ever written. You abosolutly will love this book. While Scarlette acts like one you would detest, you can't help but love her and all the other characters. If you've only seen the movie, you are in for a huge suprise. Lets just say Bonnie is not the only baby.",
            "This novel is a spactacular piece of work! At first the size of it scared me a bit, as it would most people my age, but boy am I glad I decided to read it! Scarlett is an amazing character, and the history is great. If you haven't read this classic, you are really missing out on something.",
            "Although I'm only 13, I have already read this compelling novel twice and am trying buy the book so I can read it even more! You feel like you are Scarlett's shadow, following all her movements and peeking into her mind and seeing her reasoning for her actions. My fave book!!",
            "This is a book that I believe everyone should absoluely read. From the first page to the very last you are entrolled into the deep south. The literate is beautiful as long as the glorious love story. I spent all my free time reading this book and was always thinking about Scarlet and what would happen next. This is the book that I would recommend to anyone, a lover of literature or not. When I finished the book and wiped the tears from my eyes, I was sad it was over. I wanted to go back and live in the time with Scarlet and never wanted it to end. Once is never enough with this masterpiece.",
            "This book was really good-it seemed to come alive as I read it. The main character is really amazing-not a friendly person-but she does stuff every one else was too nervous to do. Even though she grumbled all the way. Read it- but skip Alexandra Ripley's Scarlett. I'm sure she did her best, and GWTW is not an easy book to follow up, but it is nowhere NEAR this book.",
            "What can I say that hasn't already beign said? I think this is the most entertaining book of all time, not to mention historically accurate...I read it for the first time when I was 16 and in high school, and to my surprise, when we studied the Civil War a few months later in school, I already knew most of the battles, generals and dates! LOL :=)...this book is a gem.One more thing...though I think the movie is an absolute masterpiece and a must-see, I nevertheless think it doesn't do the book justice. It ommits too much. The movie doesn't show us Gerald's story and how he ran away from County Meath, Ireland straight into Georgia, Ellen's heartbreak when Phillippe Robillard was murdered and her resolve to run away frome her memories; but mainly, and what truly makes me sad...the movie doesn't develop the myriad other characters. What I mean is, it focuses on Scarlett, Rhett, Ashley and Melanie. However, the novel tells us of India and Honey Wilkes, Cade and Cathleen Calvert, Tony and Alex Fontaine, Sally and Dimity Munroe, the four Tarleton girls...you get to know so many stories...and since I truly loved all these characters, I missed them in the movie. Of course, there would have never beign enough time in a movie to cover all this...but, perhaps a miniseries could :=).P.S. By the way, in the novel, Brent and Stuart Tarleton were two very cool, masculine guys, as opposed to the dancing idiots we are shown in the beginning of the movie ;=) !",
            "This book is so overwellming we dont know how to tell you. even the begining of the book starts out wonderful, ful of detail, characteristics and a sense of humor. the plot is wonderful, and its not at all like an ordinary book. it shows emphuism and spirit as well as a sense of characters and people. this is a wonderful book and trust me if u think its to long, it isnt it actally is to short. u just have to start reading it, then youll get what i mean.",
            "This book is very attention grabbing it keeps you interested and is one of those books where you always &quot;just have to read one more chapter!&quot; Margret Mitchell is a true genius, and a very gifted writer. If you haven't seen the movie yet, I suggest you read the book first, you'll apretiate the movie more! The motion picture that was produced is the only one I know of that truly lived up to the book it was made after",
            "This book is one of the best ever written. It should be one of the books every family owns, right up there with Shakespeare. This beautifully crafted story takes you through 12 years of Scarlett O'Hara's life, and her heartbreaking romance. This book is impossible to put down once you start it.... everyone should read it. It's not tacky, or wishywashy... but real, and it touches the soul... trust me...read this book.",
            "Wow...Now this is a wonderful book. Gone With The Wind is something I know i should have read years ago! GWTW is so superbly a tale of the old south, and how it's changed by war. I was taken not only by it's vivacious and lively characters, but by it's wonderful forshadowing. And Rhett Butler, I just love to hate him!Gone With The Wind is a total must read!",
            "I am only 11 years old. Still, no one stopped me from reading the classic, Gone With the Wind. I encourage myself. When I started reading the book, I got so caught into Scarlett, Ashley WIlkes, Melanie, and Rhett Butler, that I felt as if I were living with them as well! When I got to the end of the book, I felt as if Margaret Mitchell had left out something very valuable, like she hadn't really meant to publish the un-finished book! I am getting very crazy about Gone With the Wind, and it's truly the first book that I can ever say sincerely that was my \"Favorite book\" ever! For anyone who thinks Gone With the Wind's words are too small, or that the book is too \"mushy and gushy for us,\" it's not! It's a nice, sad romance novel that I shall remember forever. Please read it. I am currently asking for the book, in hardcover original edition, for my birthday.",
            "Scarlett: you love her, you hate her. Rhett: the lovable rogue that every romance hero is measured against. An epic romance set in the antebellum era, &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; gives you a portrait of the timeless southern belle who has it all, loses it all, gets it back and - loses it again? Mitchell's fans will forever regret that she never got the chance to answer the question.",
            "This novel definitely stands the test of time, still as good as it was when I read it over 20 years ago. A great romance combined with great historical detail. Rhett Butler is still my favorite character, brilliant, sarcastic, flippant. So many people do not read this because of the movie, but the movie is a pale imitation. Please Read It! You won't regret it.",
            "I had not seen the movie before picking this up to read, so reading this book proved to be a real treat. I was immediately drawn into both Scarlett's and Rhett's characters. The way in which their lives wove in and out of each other's was beautifully told. Mitchell presented them as real multi-dimensional people, with both good and bad qualities. When I saw the movie after completing the book, I was completely disappointed with it. While the movie stayed fairly true to the book (not changing anything important), it DID omit several things that I think were crucial to understanding Scarlett in particular. (I won't ruin it for your readers.) I HIGHLY recommend this book, even if you've seen the movie. It has quickly replaced The Count of Monte Cristo as my new favorite book of all time.",
            "When I first started reading this book, I was like, &quot;ok, great, another borefest...&quot; but Gone With the Wind soon became one of my favorite books of all times! Scarlett and Rhett were some of the best characters I had ever encountered. A 5 star timeless classic!",
            "I just finished this book yesterday, and I can't stop thinking about it. Seriously an amazing story. The writing, the characters, the details, and the historical context were all perfect!I LOVED this book. Everyone should read it!",
            "I first read GWTW when I was a teenager and recently reread it after reading several books about strong women. The book is just as good as I remembered. Stories about brave women who keep moving forward have always inspired me. If you have never read GWTW, do yourself a favor and take the leap. Mitchell takes you right into the heart of a time that affected all Americans. Living in Atlanta where the book was set makes it even more appealing to me. After you finish this book, take a chance and read about other strong women that are alive and well, even as I write this. I was blown away by Mayada Al-Askari, in Mayada, Daughter of Iraq.",
            "I just loved this book! Filled with human drama, emotional conflict over basic values, and set against a war for civil justice. I saw the movie seven times! But the book was seven times better! I plan on reading it until the pages wear so thin that I can see right through them! Gone With the Wind beats any other book I've read including like my math book. This is the right way to study history! Signed: An enthusiastic 12 year old! ;-)",
            "I first read Gone With the Wind as a freshman in high school, and now 6 years later it's still one of my favorites. I have always loved the movie version, and the book is even better. Mitchell creates wonderful characters--you may not LIKE all of them, but they're amazing nonetheless.GWTW is just amazing southern lit...it may seem long, but trust me it flies by. If you like the movie then definitely read the book--you won't be disappointed.",
            "Over the summer, a friend and I made a deal that she would read To Kill A Mockingbird, one of my all-time favorite books, if I would get through Gone With the Wind. I agreed, although it was hardly a fair deal, seeing as how GWTW is over 1000 pages, and TKAMB is a mere 300...but it was the best thing I ever did. Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind is an incredible book--Scarlett O'Hara is the single most unforgettable heroine I have ever encountered--and though I often felt like strangling her for her selfishness, stupidity, and greed, I fell completely in love with her anyway. I came to know her so well by the end of the book that for awhile after I was finished, there was a bit of a hole in my life, and I missed reading about her as I would miss a friend on vacation. Fortunately, all I had to do was open the book back up, and I was again immersed in southern Civil War America. Scarlett, Rhett, Melanie, Ashley--each and every one became like a dear friend, I knew their thoughts, their feelings so well. There are not guarantees that everyone who picks up this amazing book will be able to finish it--but if you can, you are in for the time of your life.",
            "I am turning 13 now, and I first read this book when I was only 11 years old. It took me a while, but it was worth it. Gone With the Wind is the best book I have ever read so far! I loved it so much. It was very interesting, and I couldn't put it down. At some really exciting parts, I felt almost as if I were in it. This book was definitly the best book I have ever read and I recommend it to anybody.",
            "Gone with the wind was a story about a sothern girl who live in the southern part of the united states. The story tells how her life was before, during and after the civil war, She started as a bratty teenager who turn into a heartless woman,who hurt her sister and push a way a man who turly loved her. She let moeny take over her mind and soul. The stroy also goes on to tell how the civil war had on the south part of the united states.. this is a good book to read.",
            "one of the clasics and most loved books. my mom's favorite (and now mine!) she forced me to read it to improove my english and after a while i loved it! the story is sooo great, the characters are very interesting and are beautifuly descripted (as everything in this book- situations, etc.) if you liked the movie you'll love the book! Mitchell has done a great job! i can't describe the filling of reading it! it truly carries you away for a while! you think you're actualy there. it's a wonderful book!!!",
            "I loved this book! It was written in a descriptive language, but it was a level that everyone could understand. Maybe that's why people love the story. There is always one character (at least) that you can identify with. Just a warning, don't read it and expect to know all about the Civil War. It will talk about it, but it concentrats (spelling, sorry) more on Rhett and Scarlett than the war. Some say that it was racist. Slavery was wrong, there is no doubt about that, but there were always different kinds of masters. The masters in GWTW were obviously kind ones. This presents the way the South saw the war, which was very VERY hard on them. Read it and do yourself a favor. Just a suggestion, though, watch the movie first (which is also excellent) and then read the book so you won't be dissappointed with the differences.",
            "Yes, I would recommend this book to my friend because I think anyone who loves to read about history would love this book. And also anyone who loves to wear ball gowns would love to read about all the costumes Scarlett wears in this book. Over all anyone could love to read this book.",
            "I must admit, before I read the book, I watched the movie! And I liked it so much, I picked up the book and read it cover-to-cover in a matter of days! I absolutely could not put it down! Scarlett is my all-time favorite female charactor, and the whole setting is wonderful. If you have not read this book yet, what are you waiting for?",
            "I first read this book at 16 and it was the first (and about the only) book that would make me get butterflies in my stomach. Mitchell's language is very easy to read. Although some of the characters have what I consider character flaws, by in large the novel is quite entertaining.",
            "This is the best book ever written. Margeret Mitchell is the best author of all time and Gone With the Wind is both the best novel and movie of all time. I can't get much better than this description of the South. It never has a dull moment and the only ones who don't fully enjoy it is those who cannot understand it.",
            "The first time I read GWTW was in the 8th grade. At that time, I didn't comprehend a lot of what went on with the characters. A couple of months ago I read it a second time--14 years after the first time. What an amazing difference it was! I truly related to Scarlett and Rhett. They are the all-time couple. The only part I hated was Bonnie's death. I think that affected me more now that I have a child of my own and I could feel the grief that Rhett was feeling. I will most likely read it again. It made me laugh out loud, think and want to cry. A very emotional read!",
            "I'm fourteen years old, and I read both Gone With the Wind and its sequel, Scarlett. This book is truly amazing. It's a story about Scarlett O'Hara, the belle of Clayton County, who falls in love with a man already engaged. She marries another man for spite, and, when he dies, she marries yet another in order to financially support her family farm. All this while, Scarlett is still deeply in love with the man she can not have. Finally, as her friend Rhett, a blockade runner, realizes she is his dream, Scarlett finally finds where her love really should go...too late.",
            "It took a long time to read, but it was very good. Unfortunately, there are certain parts that I do not recommend in it that are a little inappropriete (between Rhett and Scarlett). Margaret Mitchell portrayed a beautiful story in this book though! :)",
            "Gone with the wind is the best book i have ever read!! It was so awesome!! Its my favorite book ever!!",
            "GONE WITH THE WIND is an excellent novel for a first time novelist, despite its many flaws. Scarlett O'Hara is one of the most memorable characters in literary history and Miss Mitchell's description of the Civil War years in Georgia is well-paced and exciting. Unfortunately, the second half of the book does not live up to the promise of the first. The pace is not as swift and Miss Mitchell's description of Reconstruction is a tad one-sided (though understandably so). The novel's main weaknesses seem to be Scarlett's long-running infatuation for Ashley Wilkes. Given their characters and Scarlett's acquaintance of Rhett Butler, this infatuation borders on the realms of disbelief. Another weakness of the book is the lack of thorough editing. In Part One, Miss Mitchell nearly devoted an entire chapter on the Tarleton family, who happened to be secondary characters. Other than that, Miss Mitchell did an excellent job. It seemed a shame that she did not continue her writing career.",
            "This book has a very involving story and I quite literally could not put it down, though I did a few times in outrage over the portrayal of slavery, the Civil War, and the Reconstruction. This novel exemplifies the Lost Cause movement, which showed the Confederacy as noble but outnumbered, and slavery as a benign and paternal institution. It is worth reading for the story, but I shudder to think that some may take what it states as fact. I am not saying that the book should be banned or censored, but it is certainly difficult to read the numerous descriptions of freedmen as lazy and the countless explanations that slaves were just so dumb that they needed the care of white people.Also, Scarlett O'Hara is a terribly unlikeable character. Whether she is stealing her sister's boyfriend or daydreaming about murdering her only true friend, Ashley, her actions and thoughts will just appall you. She is also phenomenally oblivious, not realizing that Rhett loves her until it is far too late. I was sad that Rhett left her, but who could blame him??",
            "Great Classic, an awesome book. A must have for all who love reading. I really recommend it. I'm still reading, it has over 1000 pages, also a true gift for those who love old stories like me.",
            "THIS IS THE GREATEST BOOK EVER!!!!!!!oh my godI have read gone with the wind sooo many times and im not a book person. it's soo fantastic but when ever i re-read it i can't even finish it because i get so sad. Scarlett O'hara is the best fictional character ever.",
            "This is an incredible book. The story is enthralling, the grammar superb... whether you like adventure, romance, or historical fiction, this is the book for you! And the price is a bargain!",
            "I first read this book in fifth grade, for a reading contest. Since then I reread it about every other year. Mitchell takes me into a whole different world with her story of Scarlett and Rhett, Melanie and Ashley. I love it!",
            "This is one of the best books ever.",
            "(4.5 stars, actually)I've never seen the movie all of the way through; every time it's been on I've either tuned in after it started or had to eat dinner, go to bed, or something that necessitated my having to interrupt my viewing of it. Reading the book finally got across the story in one piece. I normally dislike what Hollywood does to books adapted for the screen, but after reading the book, I agree that this is one of the few exceptions. And if you liked the movie, the book will be even better because of all of the characters and events left out (such as Scarlett's older two children Wade and Ella). One thing the movie was right to leave out, however, was the stomach-churning racism.I have no problem with an author having characters spout viewpoints that are racist (sexist, anti-Semitic, homophobic, etc.), but here those viewpoints aren't just limited to their dialogues and inner thoughts. There are a LOT of editorial commentaries on, for example, how wonderful slavery was, how the only good slave is one that was happy to be a slave, and all of the old stereotypes about African-Americans (sexual predators, lazy, childlike, superstitious, easily frightened, snoops, liars, thieves, you name it). The word &quot;Negro&quot; is never even capitalised, and many times the other n word is used to refer to them, as in &quot;a niggery smell&quot; and &quot;trashy free-issue niggers.&quot; I know that in 1936 no one was saying African-American or even Black, but at least you could capitalise the word Negro or not use the word &quot;darky&quot; so often! Many of the African-American characters even call themselves and members of their own race the n word. These slaves support their white masters, hating the slaves who dare feel themselves equal to whites and who wanted to be free. There are also two anti-Semitic slights; on page 734 it says of Hugh Elsing (who is incompetent and not very smart in business) &quot;Anyone could Jew him down on prices.&quot; On page 759 Rhett asks Scarlett if she might have some Jewish &quot;blood&quot; in her as well as Irish blood because of her love of money. The real reason Scarlett hires convicts to work in her mill is because they're cheaper, easier to exploit, and less &quot;uppity&quot; than the &quot;trashy free-issue&quot; former slaves. What other book with such racism on nearly every page is still in print today?Most Southerners were Crackers and white trash, not rich aristocrats like Scarlett and her friends, yet there's not one good word to be found about the Crackers. You'd think the aristocrats were in the majority and that barely any slaves were ever mistreated or had just cause to run away. They didn't even see how ironic it was that they were in the destitute position that the Crackers and slaves had been in for generations. The racism gets even more frequent and ugly in Part Two, the Reconstruction era. You'd never know that the KKK were a terrorist organisation; we're supposed to applaud these racist murderers and feel bad that the Yankees have taken over control? The only Southern state to avoid martial law was Tennessee, because they ratified the 14th Amendment. But of course, the other Southern states were too proud and angry to do that. And they got what they wanted before long; Reconstruction ended, African-Americans were effectively barred from exercising their Constitutional rights to vote for almost a hundred years, the Republicans (who were the progressive party way back when) were hounded out of town and threatened away from the polls, and the rich white men regained monopoly over the polls. The way it's written, you'd think the newly freed slaves, the Republicans, and the &quot;Scallawags&quot; were the ones going around terrorising people instead of the Democrats and the KKK! Still, the racism isn't the main point of the story, so I can overlook it to a point since the rest of the story is so great.The characters in the book are even better than in the movie; here Rhett isn't some charming rake, he's downright nasty, sleazy, seedy, suspicious, like an interesting-evil villain on a soap opera, the bad guy whose motivations are interesting and not mean for the sake of meanness. He's an incredible match for Scarlett, a strong empowered woman in her day and age, not afraid to flount social conventions by going out in public pregnant or shortening the period of mourning after her husbands die, a woman who has the smarts and the guts to run her own businessess because her second husband is too soft-hearted and incompetent to run them properly himself. Ashley is also a lot better in the book; he's such a doofus in the movie, but here we can understand why Scarlett is in love with him all of these years, why he inspires such passion and devotion in this fiery woman, a woman who wouldn't have spent so much time and emotion on the wimp he's portrayed as in the movie!The book does a great job at showing a Southern pov in the Civil War and Reconstruction; it would have been perfect if there hadn't been so much repugnant racist editorialising and just presented the viewpoints of these people from a vanished way of life in an unbiased way. It just looks unprofessional, besides racist, for an author to constantly inject personal opinions into the text.",
            "It started very slow for me, with Scarlett's fleeting thoughts about her dresses and balls. Then every time it became intriguing the conflict resolved itself, except for the conflict between Scarlett and Rhett which only gradually compounded. The d&eacute;nouement was poignant and well conceived-- perhaps it's just the romantic in me but I choose to see the end as just the beginning.",
            "I loved that book and i couldn't put it down. It is one of the few books that just keep you occupied in your mind long after you finished it.",
            "I never read the book before, saw bits of the movie and have heard so much about it that I thought I should buy it and add it to my literary collection. It's thicker than other versions and the print is small, if that is no problem then go ahead and buy it. My version had a few weird quirks like accordian pages and uncut pages which caused it to protrude from the book and there were ink smudges as well.Content wise, I found the book to be well written and I enjoyed Margaret Mitchell's use of imagery. The words flowed, the book was interesting and of course you're going to love Rhett Butler. This isn't a true depiction of slavery and you shouldn't use it as insight into how life was like during the Civil War, although it might give you some idea and it's interesting to read from the Southerner's point of view. Obviously there will be some annoying aspects. I found it difficult to understand the slaves and skimmed through most of their dialogue and of course you might even get annoyed that the slaves were depicted as their most loyal pets that never question their masters and didn't want their freedom.But if you considered what time it was written and by whom, then it shouldn't dampen your enjoyment of your book. It's a book everyone should read. It really is good literature and worthy of the prize it won.",
            "Why would someone want to read a story about some spoiled rich girl? It is all in the art of the storytelling, and Mitchell is a master at the craft. It has been 16 years since I read this story and I can still remember the first sentence. As soon as I read it I was hooked. Although this is mainly a love story there is more to it than meets the eye. Mitchell takes us back in time into the very midst of the civil war. It is viewed from the perspective of Scarlett who cannot fully comprehend what is going on around her, yet the reader can feel an indescribable sense of loss through her story. During her trials, she perseveres and discovers a sense of strength within herself previously unknown. Great historical romance.",
            "I really can't describe how I feel about this book and about Scarlett. She is a character without parallel. You can't help admiring her even when you deplore her for her failings. Amazing.",
            "I loved the movie. It's actually one of my favorite movies but the book puts it to shame. The book is brilliant. It's masterfully detailed without belittling it's reader. Beautifully tragic.",
            "No other piece of work has ever captured the Old South quite like \"Gone With The Wind.\" I highly recommend this classic to any person who wants to learn more about this vanished world.",
            "I was amazed at how interested I was in a classic - I have always thought and saw them to be pretty good books -although some modern ones definitly outshine them. But Gone With the Wind was a tearing, heartbreaking classic, the book so heartfelt. I could certainly relate to almost all things in the book. It truly showed a real look into humaity - something I think many people need to do these days.",
            "Gone With the Wind was a fantastic book. It's about this young woman, Scarlett O'Hara, who is living during the Civil War-in the south. Her rich and perfect life is ruined once the south loses the war and she is thrown into a time of starvation and misery. She becomes a widow and has to face those troubles as well.Mitchell created the character, Scarlett, wonderfully. She had spunk, determination, intelligence, and selfishness-traits that made her personality interesting. She does what ever she needs to get her by. Then there's Rhett. He's this dashing man who is no gentleman. I have to say, he brought a little bit of light into the dark parts of the book. He seems to be just a rude, mischevious man at first, but later on, Mitchell makes his character more full, shall I say. His character is deep and full of emotion and feelings-I really can't describe it.Then Margaret Mitchell created a bond and passion between these two characters. It was a wonderful romance, with love and anger-a sort of bittersweet romance. I felt I could connect with these characters.I loved this novel; I couldn't put it down. I read it at a young age, 11 to be exact, but I was into it none the less. It kept me hooked for 7 weeks until I finally finished it. It's long-really long-but absolutely worth it. I loved it, loved it, loved it! This book tied together historical fiction and romance, my favorite types of books, into one novel. It is a book not to be forgotten-ever.",
            "What words can I use to desribe the power and solidness that make this book!The moment I picked it up out of curiousity I was long gone in a majestic tale of sweet southern plantations,raw human emotion,and ruthless war that fill these pages with more than words,but a life all its own.Scarlett is an inspiring heroin,who isn't good nor just but is bursting with such a need to live that you get instantly swept away in her desires,impatience, contempt,love,and ultimately her thirst for anything and everything she can't have!I'm a just over half through with it and I'm frankly scared to finish it.What will I do with out Rhett,Melanie,Ashley,Mammy,Suellen,Carreen,Aunt Pittypat,Gerald,Will,and all of them.Also the ones who have died from war or sickness as Ellen,Brent,Stuart,Charles,and the nameless faces that past on in a war that never should have been fought.This book has been an inspiration to me in all respects and I'll never forget a single word of it!P.S. The south should have won,we know that!",
            "I have absolutely loved this movie from the first moment I watched it (want to say I was 6 or 7!). I finally sat down to read the book and while it took me a loooong time to finish it, I couldn't put it down. I see now why this book is so controversial, even today still. I love how things that didn't make sense, or you just wanted more of, in the movie went more into detail in the book. Melly dying, the chaos that Rhett and Scarlett went though when Bonnie died, how Scarlett landed Frank. Very good book indeed!",

            "I originally purchased this volume back in the early 80's when the series was first introduced. Each volume in this library has a beautifully decorated binding (similar to expensive leather bound books but much more reasonable in price) and when dispalyed as a set, the effect is stunning. I bought this copy as a Christmas gift for a friend in Austria who is an avid reader and book collector. As a European, I felt his library was incomplete without the greatest American novel ever written, Gone With The Wind. The copy is authentic and even though fairly old, it was in great shape! I highly recommend this seller and this set of masterpiece volumes for anyone who is considering assembling a library of literary master works.",
            "Came quickly and just in time for my moms birthday. Considering most people have probably read this masterpiece, I'm just going to review the quality of the hardcover itself. It is well done. My mom didn't wanna read her first edition anymore as she was afraid it would fall apart. Perfect substitute if I do say so myself!",

            "I was a little disappointed with this hyped-up book. Melly was all good and Scarlett all bad. This plot is good, but I think Margaret Mitchell did not develop the characters as much as she could have. Humans are not either good or bad, everyone has a bit of both in them. However, I could not put it down, and it is such an epic story of American history that I would recommend it, just don't expect it to be as great as it is said to be.",
            "Atlanta belle, Scarlett O'hara ,deals with the impacts of the Civil War and the reconstruction of the south. Scarlett is a feminist, driven to extremes to ensure her future well-being and wealth; she is selfish and egotistical, but admirable in her stubbornness. This book is an epic, starting at secession and ending during reconstruction with carpetbaggers and scalawags stripping the south of its feudal past. The book is to some extent racist and revisionist southern pride. Was this Margarett Mitchell's interpretation of how southern's themselves feel in the 20th century, or does she truly believe that slaves were relatively happy as prisoners on a plantation? This book is heavy on the romance and light on the history, making it an average book",
            "I only knew the story from the movie, so I bought this book ... The first half of the book was ok, I liked the descriptions of the suffocating constraints of upper class society at the time and Scarlett's rejection of them. The devastation of war and the struggle that Scarlett and her family went through were powerful. However, that second half of the book completely turned me off the the story. Margret Mitchell's descriptions of the reconstruction were so vile I almost put the book down. Blacks were only happy being slaves, they were too stupid for anything else. The only good blacks in the book are the ones who can serve the whites. Big Sam says he had enough of freedom and wants to go back to Tara. He even states incredulously that while in the north whites wanted him to sit at the table like he was their equal, but he couldn't do it because he is not the equal to whites. Mitchell actually says that he smiles and feels better when Scarlett starts to tell him what to do because someone is telling him what to do again. At one point Mitchell is describing how the southern whites hate the Yankees so much because the Yankees have money and food and power and they do not, yet she doesn't have any sense of irony to see that the whites are in the position that they put the slaves in for centuries.And another thing that I did not like about the book is that most of the characters are serious sociopaths. They kill anyone who breaks their rules of racial propriety. Rhett kills a black man for being \"upity\" to a white woman, another character, one of the Fontaine boys, kills a black man for for saying something to a white woman. We are not told what but it is pretty obvious it was sexual, so we have the sterotype of the black male sexual prowler. Then the same Fontaine boy kills Jonas Wilkinson for telling blacks men that they are equal to whites and that they are alowed to have white women!! He doesn't just kill him, he cuts him to ribbons with a knife. There are many more examples of this psychotic behaviour. And Mitchell treats them as if they are to be admired. While reading I kept thinking these people are all nuts. I was glad they suffered ... I lost any sense of caring about what happened to any of them, including Scarlett.Also, this is a very anti-American book. Mitchell keeps going on about how awful the Yankees and the Union and the federal government are and how great Georgia and states rights are. Of course, states rights here means being able to murder anyone who annoys you. The reconstruction section of the book should be read by everyone just to show why the flying of the Confederate flag is so offensive. It is completely un-American.And one last thing. This isn't a great love story. Rhett is really only a supporting character in the book until the last 200 pages when they get married, and for a book over 1000 pages, that's not alot. I think people remember the movie more than the actual book.I was really dissapointed with this book. I was looking forward to enjoying a nice read and discovered that it was horrible propaganda. It is really hard to believe that this book won the Pulitzer prize over Absalom,Absalom! by Faulkner.",
            "The book is better than the movie, and might be worth reading if you need an immense tome to take on vacation. Much as I despise this silly book, I have to admit it is a prime page turner.Its chief interest as a book is as a window into the viewpoint of history so common in the white upper crust South in the 1930's. The casually racist attitudes of Margaret Mitchell are a good example, and enough to make any quasi-enlightened being howl with outrage. Ditto the views on Andersonville, Reconstruction and especially the benefits of slavery to Black people.",
            "Well, I think Margaret Mitchell could have used a realy good editor. I don't mind reading long books quite the contrary I assure you, but well, one tiers of hearing yet another story about Scarlett doing something or another that gets her scorned by the people so they gossipe and Melly has to stop them. One time is enough!The story line for those few people who do not know it is the following: The young Scarlett O'Hara who is the favorit of all men falls in love with her friend Ashely Wilks who marries his cousin Melanie (Melly). Scarlett wants to hurt Ashley so she marrys his brother who soon after they are married dies in the war. Then Scarlett earns the scorne of the populus of Atlanta with her scandales behavior.Melly has a painfull childbirth and Scarlett takes her to Tara (her home) as the Yankkees march into Atlanta Georga. To Melly this kind act of careing for her wins her undieing respect.The story continues from here but I will not. The rest of the book centers around Scarlett and Rhett Butler and their feelings towareds eachother.I do not want to give the wronge impression it is not a bad book or even a book I disliked, it was great to read on the nine hour plane flight fom Budapest, but, after the plane ride was over and I still had 300 pages left I felt like I was wadding through quick sand to fininsh. If I had been on the plane for about 2 and a half more hours I would not feel this way but back home where I had so many other book to read I began to look at it as a waste of time. I am glad however that I have read it. Though I would have certenly looked at it in a more appeling light had it been hacked down about 300 pages.",
            "Ok, so I'll say it. I hated the movie Gone with the Wind. But, in an effort to be fair, I decided to read the book. I thought maybe it was something about the production that I didn't like. But, no, the book has many of the same problems.Reasons to Hate GWTW:1)It's endless for one, just like the movie. Over a thousand pages and a large bit of it is completely unecessary.2) Rhett - I don't care what anyone says, he wasn't handsome, he wasn't romantic, and there wasn't much to like about him.3) Scarlett - I've never seen a more annoying female lead. And everyone says, \"oh she grows up in the end! she stops being selfish!\" She doesn't.4) If you don't like the two main characters, what's the point?Needless to say, it was a waste of money for me and I gave my copy to a friend who loves the movie. At least she'll enjoy it.",
            "It was a very well written book but everyone told me this was a good romance book. It was not a romance book, a romance book is a book where both people love each other. Rhett loved Scarlett for most of the book, but Scarlett did not love Rhett so how was this romance?It was very good other than that though, I had trouble putting it down just to go to sleep. It is very well written and unlike some authors she actually puts in a lot of description.",
            "GONE WITH THE WIND is a book that deserved to win the Pulitzer prize for its well developed Characters and fine writing but PLEASE don't buy it as history.I see no reason to call the Atlanta citizens &quot;rare courage&quot; unless you mean half baked!The slaves -- yes for what they endured.The Union troops (Black and White) fighting to preserve the Union IN FREEDOM and President Lincoln who went through hell for the nation but NOT the Confederates who were only seeking their own advantage and trying to tear our nation apart to establish a slave empire.Sorry but facts are facts.",

            "I've read GWTW many times -once you get going you can't stop! I once gave a copy to a friend to read -she said it was 'too old fashioned' oh well her loss. I'm glad I'm in the company of true 'Windies' so I thought I'd share with you some interesting facts about the book: -Scarlett was originally named Pansy-Scarlett was partly based on Mitchell herself and her grandmother-Rhett was based on Mitchell's first husband Red Upshaw-the initials JRM in her dedication refer to her second husband John Reginald Marsh-Margaret Mitchell maintained the only character taken from real life was Prissy the maid-When asked who she'd like to be in the movie version, Mitchell said 'Prissy'-Like a detective novelist, Mitchell wrote the last chapter first and the first chapter last-GWTW is the only book to sell more copies than the bible-Mitchell nearly went blind just proofreading the manuscript!-Mitchell scrupously researched every detail for GWTW, even going to the town register to ensure there was no Rhett Butler or Scarlett O'Hara alive during the Civil War-The novel took ten years to complete, most of it was written in three-For style, she endeavoured to make her prose so that a five-year old could read it-If she were ever to write a sequel, it would be called 'Back With the Breeze' On that note,please avoid the Ripley penned sequel 'Scarlett', it is atrocious.-Gone with the Wind is my favourite book of all time, and yours too, I hope. Enjoy!",
            "I'm a literary snob, I'll admit it. I've read all the classics, and I even know some Literary Theory. Gone With the Wind? Pul-lease, racist, sexist, revanchist trash, made popular by all the young woman dreaming of being Scarlett and having both their Rhett and Ashley. Cheerleader fare. Escapist. WRONG!Gone with the Wind is an American War &amp; Peace. This is serious literature, which won the Pulitzer prize, no less. Most people don't see past the epic plot (which isn't as cut and dried as you may think) or the love story, but this is no less than a successfull attempt to reclaim a discarded culture. It is not about crinoline and lace, it it about the Apocalypse and how losers of the counter-revolution must learn to live in a place where all their politics, personal or civil, are demolished. Scarlett O'Hara is popular because she is an American, driven, materialistic, sentimental and utterly ruthless. Rhett Bulter is the tragic character of this book; the way of life and ideals he disdained are killing him, and he suffers like no one else in this post-apocalyptic landscape. His departure at the end is an act of contrition as much as a romantic failure; he had tried to recreate the materialism of the ante-bellum world, but negeclected the spirituality (such as it is) of men like Ashley Wilkes. Both men, the dreamer and the realist end up alone in a very sterile place. This book is proto-feminist as well. Scarlett survives, even as everything around her dies, but in the end, she too is alone.Don't dumb this masterpiece down. The movie fails to capture even a tenth of the depth here. And that awful sequel! Caused by the mistake that this book is some kind of romance novel. This is Art, and you can't stick a new ending on it, any more than you can a great painting or musical composition.",
            "I would give this 10 stars if I could. I haven't read this since I was a young girl in the early 70's and should never have waited so long to read it again. The characters were exceptionally well drawn, the dialogue was brilliant, particularly between Rhett (SIGH!) and Scarlett. I swear there was sparks flying off the pages. I am going to miss the people I will have to put behind me now that the book has come to an end, Rhett (SIGH), Scarlett, Mammy, Prissy and Aunt Pitty Pat (LOL).The author's use of prose was beautiful, all the scenes and action came alive for me. Some people seem to be offended by the racism in the book, but that's how things were back then. Sugar coating it would have ruined the story reducing it to a Harlequin romance.This is an incredibly well written book about the death of a civilization and the struggles to survive in the new era. This is a book that should not be missed, particulary those who enjoy historical fiction.",
            "It took this reviewer half a century to get around to reading this great novel for the first time! Appreciating it then, with 'fresh eyes' I share the view that \"Gone With The Wind\" is quite simply the most readable long novel of all time. With world-wide sales nudging 25 million, it's probably fair to say that most first-time readers (apart from the odd reviewer here at the world's biggest web site) have shared that opinion in the almost 70 years since Margaret Mitchell wrote her one-and-only book. At least one other, highly readable novelist of the past century, the late James A. Michener certainly felt that way.I'm recalling an interview of thirty years ago in which Michener - a master storyteller in his own right - expressed awe at Mitchell's achievement. I remember Michener quoted a long-forgotten critic who greeted the book's release in 1936 with the perfect, one-sentence summing up: \"It's the shortest long novel I have ever read!\" Michener predicted at that time (1975) that \"critics will forever have to grapple with the problem of why Margaret Mitchell's novel has remained so readable, and so important to so many people.\"Michener singled out a few of the \"super-dramatic confrontations\" so perfectly conjured up in Mitchell's lucid, timeless writing style: Mammy lacing Scarlett into her corset; the wounded at the railway station; Scarlett shooting the Union straggler; the girls making Scarlett a dress from the moss-green velvet draperies; Rhett carrying his wife upstairs to the long-unused bedroom.Yet for all of its amazing drama, the novel does not ultimately depend upon major confrontations for its page-turning momentum: Michener I remember, zeroed in on two 'central' paragraphs which provide the reader with perfect glimpses into the way the two major characters have 'grown' before our eyes within these pages. One of these paragraphs captivates our imagination in about the middle of the book (chapter 29):\"Somewhere, on the long road that wound through those four years, the girl with her sachet and dancing slippers, had slipped away, and there was left a woman with sharp green eyes, who counted pennies and turned her hands to many menial tasks, a woman to whom nothing was left from the wreckage, except the indestructible red earth on which she stood.\"And, in the final pages, that indelible portrait of Rhett, age forty-five:\"He was sunken in his chair, his suit wrinkling untidily against his thickening waist, every line of him proclaiming the ruin of a fine body and the coarsening of a strong face. Drink and dissipation had done their work on the coin-clean profile, and now it was no longer the head of a young pagan prince on newly minted gold, but a decadent, tired Caesar on copper debased by long usage.\"It's true to say (again as Michener noted thirty years ago) that the weakness of \"Gone With The Wind\" is the almost exclusive focus on Atlanta, ignoring the rest of the South: When in fact, it was really the ENTIRE South that changed, \"altered by war, and defeat, and social upheaval - and stark determination to re-establish itself.\" Michener astutely observed that GWTW \"depicts with remarkable felicity, the spiritual history of a region.\"Most everyone these days would concede that Margaret Mitchell's personal views on the \"liberation of the former slaves\" (as expressed in subsequent interviews) were less than compassionate. Nevertheless, it was NOT Mitchell who composed those words which make some of us wince when they're scrolling up the screen in the movie version - words quaintly poetic perhaps, but manifestly insulting to those Americans whose ancestors never mistook the days of slavery as part of some \"pretty world\" poignantly longed-for, or in some way better than America today. (This reviewer has a pretty good memory for well-cadenced English prose, and this is his memory of those opening words from some anonymous male screenwriter.)\"There was a land of cavaliers and cotton fields called the 'Old South.' Here, in this pretty world, gallantry took its last bow. Here was the last ever to be seen of knights and their ladies fair, of master and slave. Look for it only in books, for it is no more than a dream remembered, a civilization gone with the wind.\"So much better are the novelist's own words, distilled into so many sentences and paragraphs that positively 'sing' in our memory. Like this one:\"He swung her off her feet into his arms and started up the stairs. Her head was crushed against his chest and she heard the hard hammering of his heart beneath her ears. He hurt her and she cried out, muffled, frightened. Up the stairs, he went in the utter darkness, up, up, and she was wild with fear.\"Or this:\"Hunger gnawed at her empty stomach again, and she said aloud: \"As God is my witness, as God is my witness, the Yankees aren't going to lick me. I'm going to live through this, and when it's over, I'm never going to be hungry again. No, nor any of my folks. If I have to steal or kill - as God is my witness, I'm never going to be hungry again.\"-----I have often thought that \"age twenty-six\" is the single most important year of any long and healthy lifetime (for too many subjective reasons to list here; but think of the athletes or musicians we've admired when they were at the very summit of their game -- in their twenty-sixth year). So it comes as no surprise to learn that Margaret Mitchell was at that same magic age when she began work on this --- the book another great novelist of the last century would term \"this long and powerful recollection of her home town - destined to become a titanic tale of human passions, loved around the world\" . . . (its astonishing impact) \"a mystery then, and remains one now.\"",
            "Growing up in Georgia, I've had a first hand look at the American South. After reading Gone with the Wind, I realized the South hasn't changed that much. We don't have slavery anymore but the lifestyle and traditions remain much the same. THAT is what makes Mitchell's work so enlightening. She relates the Southern Culture better than any other writer barring Pat Conroy. She shows the strength, the loyalty, the compassion, and the gumption of a good southern woman. She also relates the frustration and rebellion at being expected to take a backseat service-oriented role in society and especially in the family. But it doesn't stop there. Mitchell also weaves one heck of a story scattered with some of the most unique and memorable characters in fiction. Characters such as Scarlett O'Hara's love interest Ashley, her bestfriend/worst enemy Melanie (Ashley's wife), and of course the sly Rhett Butler. The book is timeless, the story compelling.A romantic at heart, I appreciate the subtleties of the struggle for love unattained and love unreturned, both of which give this story a personal touch. If you are curious to see why this novel is the 2nd best selling book in the world next to the Bible, pick it up and expect a long, complex story with unforgettable characters, a glimpse of a fleeting culture, and prose that tastes like an expensive red wine.",
            "Margaret Mitchell wrote, for her first book (an earlier work, called &quot;Lost Laysen&quot; has since been published), an exhaustingly researched, wide-ranging, exciting and thrilling book set in the Civil War. This book - Gone With The Wind - was a runaway success; and ultimately made into the biggest movie of its day. Alright, let's admit it, by modern standards it's sexist, racist, overblown, and melodramatic. And it's pretty darned brilliant. I have read this book no less than ten times! In theory, one ought to detest that spoiled little brazen, Scarlett O'Hara, but Margaret Mitchell makes her into a vivid, strong human being, a woman with spirit and the will to survive, but who was essentially immature and spoilt. But she was fiercely protective, loyal, and someone who you were forced to admire, even as you disliked what she was doing. She also had a alarming propensity to fall in love with the wrong men - this was a woman doomed to claw her way anywhere to succeed, but at the same time, estranging herself in the eyes of her Society. But does she give up, does she make it a tragedy? No. She gets up and keeps going, she just doesn't let people see that she minds it very much. She is an inspiration, but she doesn't really deserve to be. Scarlett is flawed, hideously so, but none the less, we are forced to admire her. She IS the book. A weaker or less flawed heroine would be irritating or just TOO unsympathetic. Her unrequitted love is very believable, it's happened to most of us at one time in our youth, and we never really quite shake that first infatuation off without a rude or painful awakening.The attitudes which feature in this book, although sexist and racist to us now, were perfectly normal for Civil War Southerners - Margaret Mitchell really understood the way people behaved at this time, and did not make them behave out of period or in anachronistic ways. Like Georgette Heyer and Regency England, she has a true understanding and insight into the period she is writing about - she LIVES it, and her people could have been alive then without unduly standing out as unusual or unremarkable.Scarlett is a rebel, but she does not go as far as a modern author might make her heroine go. She loves her family and her land, though she may deny it, and she is very proud. She is an inspirational woman, a true forerunner of the power woman of the 1980s - a sensational concept, even for the 1930s! The clever thing is how, in such a huge and spreading book, everything comes together. It may seem trivial and unnecessary to discuss Aunt Pittypat's drawing room, or go into the minutae of Scarlett's wardrobe, or to discuss events that happened a long time ago, but believe me, it is all very important in building up a coherent and very accurate (scarily accurate, for 1930s historical fiction - Heyer and Mitchell, as far as I know, were the only authors at this time who really bothered to research in depth for their &quot;lightweight&quot; historical fiction writing.) Gone With The Wind is a masterpiece. It must not be read with modern eyes, but as an amazing study of how people behaved, lived, and survived throughout the Civil War in America on the losing side.",
            "I love this book and have read it many times however this particular edition is missing a page, page 713 has been replaced with page 813, and you don't want to miss a word of Gone With the Wind!",
            "Margaret Mitchell was born in 1900 in Atlanta, Georgia. Throughout her childhood she heard stories of life before, during, and after the Civil War. In the 1920s she suffered a broken ankle. In order to pass the time, and inspired by the stories of her childhood, Mitchell began to write a book. She did not consider herself a novelist and did not think about publication--until 1935, when she impulsively gave the ragged manuscript to a visiting publisher's representative. The rest, as they say, is history: GONE WITH THE WIND was a phenomena. The reading public loved it; even the critics hailed it; and a celebrated film version merely added fuel to the fire. It has been translated into a host of languages, it has never been out of print, and to this day it remains among the most widely-read novels ever written.In hindsight, it is obvious that Mitchell was somewhat overpraised as an artist. She is not a writer who can complete with the likes of Jane Austen or Mark Twain, and she has a distinct tendency to write \"on the surface\" rather than in depth. But she has two great strengths, and the first of these is narrative power. If nothing else, Mitchell was a born story teller with an instinctive grasp of what it took to make you turn the next page; at one thousand pages, GONE WITH THE WIND is a long book--but it never seems long when you are actually reading it. Mitchell's second great strength is ability to create archetypical characters that seem to embody everything you know as well as everything you feel you should have known, and Scarlett O'Hara joins the ranks of Austen's Elizabeth Bennett, Thackery's Becky Sharp, and Tolstoi's Anna Karenina as one of the most memorable female characters in the history of literature. As art, the novel does have faults, but it is vividly, sharply alive. You believe in the world and the events and people that Mitchell presents.Social critics presently accuse Mitchell and GONE WITH THE WIND of racism. I find it difficult to criticize a writer and a work from the past for failing to adopt the attitudes of the present; all writers bring their own day and age to the table, and Mitchell's attitudes and ideas about black people and slavery were in the American mainstream of her day. In this sense, the book is perhaps best considered as a marker of where we once were and how far we have come since its original publication. It is also worth noting that while GONE WITH THE WIND is set before, during, and after the Civil War, and while many of its characters are slaves or freed slaves, it is not a novel about the Civil War or about slavery. It is about a self-centered woman of that era who is clever without being intellectual, who is remarkably hypocritical, and who can in many ways be described as morally bankrupt. We see this world through her eyes, and since she is utterly uninterested in the causes of the war, and even less so in the myriad of moral and ethical issues that swirl around slavery, we learn very little about either in any real sense--and to further complicate matter Mitchell never implies that Scarlett, those who swirl around her, and their attitudes and actions are to admired or accepted; they simply are.This said, social critics do have a significant point when they note that the popularity of GONE WITH THE WIND had the effect of perpetuating the idea that slavery was \"not all that bad\" long after such ideas should have been no longer tolerated. I do indeed recommend the book--it is extremely memorable, so much so that it virtually created the genre of romantic historical fiction without every being bested by the host of novels that followed it--but I do not recommend that any one come to it without a fairly good idea of what the Old South was like in actual fact. It is all very well to see that world through the eyes of Scarlett O'Hara for a time, but we need the ability to pull away from her point of view, and to compare it to reality, once the novel is set aside.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",
            "\"Gone With the Wind,\" as a novel, has been mistakenly dismissed by literary critics as pulp fiction for the masses. This view is premature and biased, in my opinion. If one digs deeply into the fabric of this very complex novel, one is likely to find that this novel works on two very different levels: the external level, in which themes such as survival and romantic love figure prominently; and the internal level, in which themes such as division v. reunion and the child v. the adult figure prominently.An external analysis of the novel yields much that has been obvious to the reading and movie-going public for years. \"Gone With the Wind\" is, most obviously, a very powerful novel about a young woman's survival of two unique crises: the American Civil War and Reconstruction of the South that followed. The personal qualities of those who survive and prosper in this novel -- characters such as Scarlett O'Hara, Rhett Butler, Mammy, Will Benteen, old Mrs. Fontaine, even Mrs. Merriwether -- are contrasted sharply with those who do not survive and prosper: Ashley Wilkes, Ellen O'Hara, Gerald O'Hara, and Scarlett's first two husbands, Charles Hamilton and Frank Kennedy.Melanie Hamilton presents an interesting study in the story of survival. Margaret Mitchell uses her to represent the dignified stateliness of the Old South matron. Rather than becoming a victim of the Old South's disintegration, she survives in a way that equals or even surpasses Scarlett's survival. Melanie, whom Mitchell originally intended as the novel's heroine, is the woman who saves Tara from burning to the ground; the woman who drags her father's Mexican War sword to the landing at Tara, helping Scarlett defend it from the Yankee invader; and the woman who stands against polite society in order to defend Scarlett, her beloved sister-in-law, from the town's gossip. Yes, she dies at the end of the novel, and Mitchell uses this to represent the passing of the Old South. However, even here, Melanie dies in her own bed, in her own home, with her own family about her, and she dies on her own terms: after conceiving a child she knew placed her own life at risk.It is also about three interconnected love stories: the traditional, dignified courtship and marriage of Melanie Hamilton and Ashley Wilkes; the thwarted, unconsummated relationship between Ashley Wilkes and Scarlett O'Hara; and the temptuous, passionate courtship and marriage of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler. The central theme of these love stories is summarized early in the novel by Scarlett's father, Gerald O'Hara: \"Only when like marries like can there be any happiness.\"These themes, while universal and very powerful, are only external to the novel, and I don't believe the novel's power or universality are derived from the themes of survival and love. I believe its power is much more subtle. Indeed, for years, it has been a mystery to literary critics why this novel was received equally well by 10-year olds as well as 95-year olds. Therein lies its secret: it is a novel with which both the 10-year old child and the 95-year old adult can identify strongly. It is a novel about children and it is a novel about adults.Every one of the major characters has qualities of both children and adults in them. These are handled subtly, not obviously, and the language of the novel, which I believe Margaret Mitchell crafted deliberately along these lines, takes the reader in this direction. For example, listen to what Scarlett says about men: \"All the men in Scarlett's life, the Tarleton twins, the Calvert boys, Charles, and Frank, she could dismiss with the phrase, 'What a child!' Not Rhett. He was an adult in everything he did. Only Rhett and Ashley ...\"Scarlett is portrayed as both child and adult. \"I'm always your little girl,\" she says to her mother in the middle of the Civil War, when in fact she is a widow with a 2-year old son. The woman whose heroism saves Tara from oblivion is evaluated by Rhett at the end: \"My pet, you're such a child.\" By the end of the novel, when Scarlett is only 28 years old, she has been married three times, widowed twice, given birth to three children, and buried one of them. Yet, in her dreams, she is still \"a lost child.\" When asked if she thought Scarlett ever got Rhett back, Margaret Mitchell said: \"I don't think so, but I do think she finally grew up.\"Melanie is the adult who masquerades in child's clothing -- and has a child's figure. Mitchell takes pain to describe Melanie's physical appearance \"as that of a 10-year old boy, with narrow hips and height barely coming up to Ashley's shoulders.\" Yet it is Melanie who has the wisdom to see Scarlett's finer qualities, her strength of character, her commitment to her promises, and her ability to survive -- wisdom that is ironically viewed by Scarlett (and others) as foolishness. She is portrayed as foolish to be so loyal and loving to Scarlett; yet it turns out, in the end, that Scarlett's attachment to Ashley was imaginary, and it turns out in the end that Scarlett loves Melanie deeply. She is portrayed as foolish for defending Rhett Butler so staunchly, yet her wisdom about his good qualities is thoroughly vindicated by the novel's end. Of all the principles, it is Melanie who is the most wise -- and the most adult. Yet her external appearance is very childlike.Rhett is usually depicted as an adult, the black sheep of a prominent Charleston family who makes his own fortune as a blockade runner from just a $1,000 investment. He admits, at novel's end, that he wanted to care for Scarlett, as an adult would care for a child; yet he is relentlessly mothered by Melanie, especially toward the end: she straightens him up so that he can be presentable to Scarlett after her miscarriage; and only she can convince him to consent to Bonnie's funeral. Further, he enables Melanie's mothering throughout the novel. She is the only person that he truly respects because, I suspect, she is a reminder to him of his own mother, a character who is rather prominent in the novel, though largely absent. Interestingly, it is only Melanie who comes into contact with her, as she greets mourners for Bonnie in the parlor of Scarlett and Rhett's mansion.Ashley Wilkes is the real child of the four principles, but it takes Scarlett the entire duration of the novel, more than 12 years, to realize this. Ashley is the weakest character, the one who has failed to give up the \"life that [he] loved,\" the one who depicts the charm and grace of the Old South to Scarlett -- the only time that she succumbs to the mistake of looking back. Mitchell is very deft with this scene. It is portrayed as a scene that exposes Ashley and Scarlett's illicit love for each other. However, what's really being exposed here is their common dependence on the past, Ashley's being overt and Scarlett's much more deeply repressed. By implication, it's also exposing the true nature of their attraction for each other, because they shared a common upbringing, growing up on neighboring plantations.This scene is expertly crafted. While Ashley and Scarlett are reminiscing about the charm and grace of their common past -- an event which culminates in their hugging in a truly platonic manner, one in which they begin to understand each other -- they are exposed to the gossip and criticism of Atlanta society. What's being exposed here is not their unconsummated romance; it's their common reliance on living in the past. It's fitting that they should be exposed when they're reminiscing about their common past, because that is the real force of their attraction, the real reason for their love (an ultimately childish love, by the way). Mitchell uses this scene to expose them not to Atlanta society, but to the reader. They're not in love with each other; they're in love with a life that is (forgive the cliche) gone with the wind. At the end of the novel, when Scarlett realizes she truly loves Rhett, she sums up her relationship with Ashley: \"I've lost my lover and I've gained another child.\"Virtually every relationship in this novel can be evaluated as child v. adult; think, for example, of Mammy, the real mother figure of the novel. Look at Ellen and Gerald O'Hara; he was 43 when they married and she was 15; yet she mothers him, right up until her death. Consider one of their final episodes, recounted to Scarlett in Atlanta by John Wilkes, in which Gerald wanted to fight in the war. Ellen puts him to the test insofar as riding his horse is concerned, a test that \"little Gerald, who barely came up to her shoulders\" failed miserably. After Ellen dies, Gerald's life collapses and he is a broken man, right until his death.Finally, there is the theme of division and reunion that appears on numerous occasions throughout the novel. Consider how the novel starts: Scarlett is seated on the front steps of Tara between the Tarleton twins -- a divisive force for two brothers who are otherwise as \"alike as two bolls of cotton.\" The novel begins with internal and external symbols of division. The Civil War starts. We are introduced to Scarlett and Melanie, the two heroines who are complete opposites and, at least for Scarlett, adamantly opposed to one another. We are introduced to Ashley and Rhett, the two heroes who are also complete opposites, at least externally, and rather opposed to one another; Ashley dislikes Rhett's blackguardism, and Rhett has contempt for Ashley's weaknesses.Mitchell deliberately tries to convince the reader, by cleverly contrasting their external characteristics, that these characters are hopelessly divided. Scarlett \"hates\" Melanie because she is a foolish simpleton and Ashley's wife; Rhett is a symbol of the New South, and Ashley is a symbol of the Old South; Rhett is a survivor, Ashley is a victim. Scarlett is a divisive figure in Melanie and Ashley's marriage. Scarlett is a divisive figure in the Hamilton-Wilkes families: toward the end, she is the indirect cause of a family feud that splits the family into two separate camps. Scarlett, herself, is a divided character - the result of an alliance between an Irish immigrant and an established aristocrat from the Savannah coast. \"In her face were too sharply blended the sharp features of her father, an Irish immigrant, and the more delicate features of her mother, a French aristocrat from Savannah.\" Mitchell has even put division on Scarlett's face -- one reason that Vivien Leigh, who as an actress utilized divided eyebrows (one up, one down) for Scarlett, was such a perfect choice for the part. \"She is my Scarlett,\" admitted Margaret Mitchell.Division is the premise of the novel. Reunion is its conclusion. Everything that was divided is ultimately united by novel's end. Melanie and Scarlett reach an understanding with each other; Scarlett comes to realize how much she loves and relies on Melanie, and comes to appreciate her strength, the \"steel courage\" that has sustained her through many crises. Indeed, the evolution of their relationship is one of the most touching and endearing aspects of the novel. Whereas we begin the novel with Ashley depicted as the war hero whose life is lived for \"dignity and honor\" and with Rhett depicted as the blackguard who is motivated only by crass selfishness, we end the novel with Ashley reduced to a helpless, purposeless victim and Rhett enhanced as a loving husband and father. Along the way, the stark contrasts that Mitchell draws early between Rhett and Ashley yield to sympathetic comparisons. \"Did it ever occur to you, Scarlett, that Rhett and I are fundamentally alike?\" Ashley inquires toward the end. Yet their similarities are evident -- though repressed -- from the beginning. In a surprising confrontation with Mrs. Merriwether, Melanie defends Rhett's criticisms of the war because they mirror things her husband has written to her. Ashley and Rhett begin the novel as divided and opposed to one another; they end united and unified as characters. Melanie and Scarlett, likewise, begin the novel as opposed opposites and end the novel united and unified. Division begets reunion.This theme, division and reunion, is especially powerful when you consider the historical context of the novel. In my view, it is no accident, but rather a careful decision on Margaret Mitchell's part, to time the action of the novel from April 1861, the start of the Civil War, the ultimate symbol of division, to September 1873, the end of Reconstruction, the ultimate symbol of reunion. It is a breathtaking historical backdrop for a novel whose dramatic power is derived from characters experiencing division and reunion in their lives.It is curious that Mitchell's novel has born the brunt of belittling and contemptuous literary criticism over the years. When it debuted, it sold millions and won the Pulitzer Prize; no film, before or since, has ever been so widely anticipated as the 1939 film was. Its massive popularity, I suspect, and Mitchell's melodramatic writing style have contributed to this contempt. However, when one considers the thematic breadth of the novel, its impeccable structure, and the awesome scope of its narrative force, \"Gone With the Wind\" is a singular and astonishing achievement. I believe its universality, its appeal from the 10-year old to the 95-year old, is best explained by the themes of child v. adult and division v. reunion. I also believe that it is these themes that explain why it captivates us after 71 years and will continue to captive generations to come.",
            "I saw the movie before I read the book, and I thought it would be too much to read a book that was so long. But I was enthralled by the 2nd page, by the descriptions and the dialogue. The rest of the novel kept me enthralled because of the unconventionality of Scarlett and Rhett, and the messages about war, the finished past and the unavoidable future of the South in the mid-1800's. I loved the richness of the descriptions of the Old South, which made me feel so nostalgic even though I'm not even from the South! Also, I found the many characters to be well-developed and each major character had a distinct and sympathizable personality.My favorite parts are the ones with Scarlett and Rhett at each others' throats, before and during their \"courtship\" and even after they were married. Their dialogue is hilarious and clever, though admittedly the wit is all from Rhett and the amusement comes from seeing Scarlett brought down a few notches. Though it hurts to know that even though Scarlett FINALLY matures enough to dump Ashley and realize she needed to change, Rhett is no longer willing to give her another chance. It seems whenever Scarlett is actually sincere about something nobody believes her or is willing to give her the benefit of the doubt (except Melanie of course). What's great about the novel is that if one was one of the characters, he would just see Scarlett on the surface: selfish, conniving and coy, but with the narration, one can see where Scarlett is coming from, and actually sympathize with her actions. She was definitely a woman born in the wrong era. She would do just fine in the 21st Century.Scarlett is very much my favorite character, because even with her insensitivity, selfishness, and materialism, she is oftentimes the strongest person in the passel of main characters. She worked to the bone when she returned to Tara, knowing that her hands would have to be ruined in order to eat and live and provide for the family that looked to her for leadership. Sometimes it seemed she was the only practical, level-headed person in the whole book (excepting Rhett), especially since people like Suellen were just refusing to work because it was \"beneath\" them, refusing to admit things have changed and work had to be done. Scarlett knows what she wants and has the sense to go ahead and try to get it.Although, many times Scarlett's selfishness comes up so unexpectedly I burst out laughing at the outrageousness of her personality. For example there would be a long conversation or narrative about how the past was so beautiful and peaceful or about a nice thing a person has done, and the book has Scarlett completely overturn the comments with her contemptous thoughts on the contrary of what was just described. Her problem is that though she sees what's in front of her, she doesn't get the POINT of what she's seeing. Hence the character of Rhett. He is so much like her, but he is able to see what she misses. He points them out to her plainly, and in Rhett Scarlett meets her match. He has what she's missing. As a result, another piece of the novel comes together: through Rhett, Scarlett is able to mature and bridge, to an extent, the gap between the ideals of people living in the past and those living in the present. Unfortunately, this maturation is not without consequences.Because of Scarlett's headstrong personality, I found GWTW endlessy amusing, and I think it was meant to be - in showing the huge gap between the over-the-top, in-the-moment practicality of Scarlett and the immaterial dreams of yesterday held so tightly by Old Southerners like Ashley, Melanie, and the rest, Mitchell tells us that both ways of thinking have their benefits and faults. It's not good to hold on to the past without moving forward, but only worrying about current physical security without holding tight to family and identity will cause pain and loneliness in the future. The messages are many in GWTW, and none of the 1000+ pages are superfluous. It was a pleasure to read, to laugh at the witty dialogue, sigh with sadness or nostalgia, scoff with annoyance at characters' actions, and feel the pain of the bitter ironies that define the lives of characters like Scarlett and Rhett.GWTW is not just a love story to me; it's so much more than that. It makes you think about what's past, but warns you not to dwell on the memories. Also, issues about war, race, and gender are definitely touched upon, oftentimes subtly, and it makes for great analysis. I can see why this novel won the Pulitzer Prize. Many issues are laid out all at once in front of you, forcing you to acknowledge their presence, whether it's painful to do so or not. \"Gone With the Wind\" made it to my \"favorite books\" list by page 150. It's an amazing literary work; a real masterpiece.",
            "The movie is one the top classic cinimatographies that remains a hit to this day. The book however is far better. I was so spellbound by this novel that it put the movie to shame (although I am still in love with the movie).The words of Margaret Mitchell combined with the voice naration of Linda Stephens sets an imaginative scene unlike any other. I will admit there were a couple areas in this audio book that somewhat dragged a little and there were other parts where Linda Stephens' voice dramatized a little too far.Margaret Mithchell wrote a breathtaking novel of true passion combined with the overwhelming heartache and the meaning of love in it's finest. And Linda Stephens brings out the roll of each charactor, each with a pitch of their own.Chapter by chapter leads out the fall of selfishness, the depth of passion and the power one has in the will to correct. Gone With the Wind portrays how one [Scarlett O'Hara], like so many can blind themselves in seeking to gain wealth of money and false imagination - where as it can fool (time and time again) to throw away the richest love one could ever gain.",
            "\".....Was Tara still standing? Or was Tara also gone with the wind which had swept through Georgia?.....\" pg 365\".... Thoughts circled and swooped above her, dived down and drove tearing claws and sharp beaks into her mind, For a timeless time, she lay still, her face in the dirt, the sun beating hotly upon her...\" pg 356This is a literary masterpiece that really needs no introduction; and the only reason I comment tonight is for benefit of younger people who may not have read it as yet, and are making comparisons with the more recent \"Scarlett\" and, even more recently, \"Rhett Butler's People\". Neither of the sequel books, written by others, are representatives of the talent embodied by Margaret Mitchell herself.This story is one of the best ever told, and will go down through the ages as such. An unmatched tale of the Old South, where worlds are turned upside down and those exposed to sudden loss of wealth and life stations find unsuspected strengths within themselves as they rebuild their fortunes with nothing more than their tenacity and wits or find themselves \"winnowed out\" (as Rhett Butler so eloquently remarked) in the struggle. Unrequited love, passion, jealousy, mingle seamlessly with the historical passages written with digital accuracy regarding the Civil War and the resulting Reconstruction, misery for both black and white - is woven into the fabric of the story with attention to detail that, once read, lives within you forever. It's cast of characters live, breathe, and project their differences from the brilliance of Mitchell's pen into our own minds; truly unforgettable. THAT is the true measure of literary genius.If you are in search of the story, read this one and forget the other two, as there is no equal to the original GWTW, nor is there ever likely to be.",
            "GONE WITH THE WIND was a phenomenon when it first appeared as a novel during the 30's and its place in popular culture became even more entrenched when the wildly successful movie was released a few years later. The book is still worth reading today as Mitchell very skillfully brings to life the years just before during and after the Civil War from the viewpoint of white Georgians. When Mitchell started writing this book the Civil War had only been over less than seventy years (very comparable to a contemporary author writing about the events surrounding World War II) and the country was very deeply divided between North and South. Mitchell's Southern sympathies and prejudices are often very apparent and the modern reader needs to realize the author was a product of her time and not be so easily offended that they can not enjoy what the book has to offer. Mitchell created many memorable characters in her novel and though it has been called a \"soap opera\" the situations and characterizations are not unrealistic and the historical research is sound.",
            "It is a long book and oft discussed with over six hundred reviews, thus this is not an attempt to give a general, overall review. But there is a point I'd like to discuss:I was amused at several of the comments written by other reviewers regarding the point of view in Gone With the Wind. It is easy to only watch the movie and quickly read the book and leave with the wrong impression of what Mitchell wanted to portray about Southern culture and Southern values.But if the reader takes his or her time and carefully reads the passages, a very different picture of the antebellum south comes about. Pay particular attention to the dialogues between Scarlett and her mammy, and Scarlett and Rhett, and even Ashley. Scarlett routinely complains at having to act like a simpleton in order to win men's attention, and having to conceal her often much brighter \"smartness\" (I hesitate to use the word intelligence here, because, Scarlett, for all her skills and quick smartness, probably doesn't qualify as an intelligent person) in fear of scaring away potential suitors.The antebellum upper class woman, as portrayed by Mitchell, was a dainty flower, but one whose life was heavily circumscribed by the social expectations of the men. Mitchell points out the juxtaposition between plantation mistresses being expected to appear to the public as dainty china objects, yet behind the scenes be expected to manage large plantations, oversee dozens or hundreds of slaves, and deal with the everyday facts of nature (such as childbirth and sickness). Ellen O'Hara is portrayed as the archetypical plantation mistress who successfully pulls off this image: while her husband spends his day hunting and riding horses and drinking whisky, Ellen had a dawn to midnight existence as a tireless manager of a plantation, and \"her hands were never seen still.\"To some people it seems that Mitchell idolized certain aspects of antebellum southern culture-the theatre of manners that the southern upper class created for themselves, but the author was well aware and effectively portrayed to the reader how limiting it was to women. In fact, it was only with the destruction of the plantation world and the class of chivalry that Scarlett, her main character, was effectively liberalized. It is very much a feminist novel in the sense that it is the woman who succeeds (at least materialistically) when most men around her failed.The issue of slavery is a relatively minor one in the book, and not one that Mitchell discussed to great lengths. However, one must keep in mind that the book portrays the views of the upper class aristocracy class, and it is interesting to note that despite the supposed benevolence of the O'Haras and their neighbors, of the 100+ slaves at Tara before the war, only four remained to stay with their old masters. Mitchell did not get into great details on the brutality of slavery before the war or of white-black relationships, but she didn't completely ignore it either. During a scene when Scarlett visits several neighbors (all women) on a nearby plantation after Sherman and his army had passed through, one of the women mentioned how all the black women had gone off riding behind the Yankee soldiers, and that they'll get nothing but yellow babies out of it. The other ladies, shocked at the bringing up of a delicate topic, hushed her, but old Grandma Fontaine retorted back with, \"We've all seen yellow babies before and we know what it means.\"There is, of course, Rhett Butler's consistent disparaging of Southern culture and southern values.Mitchell did not idealize the antebellum south, far from it.",
            "Gone With the Wind is novel of epic proportions, and it does read like a soap opera. Then again, so does every book this long (try War and Peace sometime). This book examines a spoiled, ante-bellum socialite who has never had to lift a finger and the way she deals with utter poverty, death, and tragedy all around her. The book does have its flaws, which I will touch on in a moment, but it should be read simply for Scarlett's struggle. Yes, she is rude, mean, and a generally selfish and scheming woman, but she also a paragon of strength who simply refuses to bow to anyone. Throughout the book, people say that Sherman himself should beware of Scarlett, and they're right.Getting away from Scarlett--difficult in this novel--there are several other main characters. Rhett-the only man she cannot lure with her charms, Ashley-the only man she cannot get with her charms, and Melanie-Ashley's saintly wife--the antithesis of Scarlett, whom Scarlett hates but feels compelled to help.Much of this book is somewhat depressing, reading about hunger, toiling in the fields, working on the sick, but it does make you appreciate what you have.Now, for the flaws. First, the big one: Racism. Yes, this book is racist, but, for heaven's sake, it was written in 1936 by a woman from Atlanta who had been raised with her antebellum grandmothers. It's set in the Civil War, and it does accurately portray the feelings of whites at the time. Some of the black sentiments (&quot;Gee, Miss Scarlett, I wouldn't know what to do without you telling me&quot;) are a little incredulous, but there were some plantation owners who were nice to their slaves. Of course, the ones who get publicity were the evil ones. While evil slave owners did exist, this book is not about them, and it should be taken at face value. No, it isn't politically correct, but it wasn't meant to be. If you only want politically correct books, then you really can't even read the Bible.Other flaws: the subjecation of women to men (think of the time era again), the length (some descriptive parts can be skipped), and the many plots (watch the movie as you go to keep it all together).Other than these few things mentioned, this book is a marvelous example of Southern literature, but don't take it as a historical novel of the Civil War because it wasn't meant to be that. It's the story of one woman's refusal to surrender to whatever comes her way. It just happens to take place during the Civil War. It could have happened during the American Revolution; it just didn't. Also, it leaves you with a serious debate with yourself: Scarlett--justified or evil? Yes, she gets her riches and life back while everyone else mopes, but they eventually get their lives back as well--they just didn't demean themselves. Rare is the book that makes you question your own thoughts on the main character.",
            "ARGUABLY one of the greatest romance novels ever written, Margaret Mitchell's Gone With The Wind is also a quintessential war anecdote.I found nothing more powerful than to read of an American war set in 1864 and hear the television espousing our current warfare in the background - some things don't change.The vivacious, yet practical-minded, Scarlett O'Hara is a clean slate for Mitchell to mar with the outset of war, providing a powerful metaphor for generations to come.Unfortunately, many young people are not introduced to such classic literature and the distinct and poignant parallels between the American Civil War and the current Gulf War II may be left undiscovered.Considering her novel was written in 1936, it is easy to confuse her ability to evoke such universal emotions for modernity.Mitchell's delicate portrayal of the South set against the harsh backdrop of war can still be affiliated to by readers in the 21st Century.Reasoning war, censoring protestors or 'speculators', and anticipated outcomes are adeptly constructed by Mitchell that you wonder how predictable human nature must be.\"All wars are sacred... To those who have to fight them. If the people who started wars didn't make them sacred, who would be foolish enough to fight?\"It's such honesty, in a time of ettiquette and refinery, that makes the abhorrent Rhett Butler such a formidable character.Coercing the seductress to dispense of typically Southern notions, Rhett epitomises the way a war will corrupt and educate a sentimental nation.Mitchell presents her flawed characters with affection. You may find Scarlett simple and Rhett a rogue, but you come to love what they add to this charged scene.Gone With The Wind should hardly be dismissed because of its romantic formula and age. This book is timeless and has much to teach younger readers.",
            "I read this book two years ago during the summer I was fourteen. It was definitely one of the best books I ever read, and I don't think I would be me today without the influence of Gone With the Wind. Margaret Mitchell is a witch with a pen; her thrilling story of Scarlett, Rhett, Melanie, Ashley, and Tara is as compelling as it is frightening. You love every character and hate them at the same time while next to them you feel their pain, their longing, their heartache, their confusion, their human wickedness, and their love.Two warnings: I made the mistake of reading the ending of the book before I got to it. I didn't understand the ending but thought I did, so it ruined not only the completion but also my enjoyment of a matchless masterpiece. Do not, under any circumstances, read the ending. Secondly, if you have not seen the movie, don't watch it. If you have, don't be fooled. I read the book long before I saw the movie and felt like a part of GWTW. The movie is supposed to be one of the best ever made, but I was disappointed with it. The characters seemed compromised somehow, and the glory of my imagination was warped.GWTW is a daunting book, but I have not met a person on earth who does not call it a mountain above most. Read the book and love it!",
            "Thirty-two summers ago, I read my Great Aunt Cora's old copy of GWTW. The size was not daunting, even at twelve years old. I lived in Margaret Mitchell's Old South for weeks, shunning the sun as all Southern ladies should. Excitingly, I told my mother that Scarlett just kissed Rhett on the road to Rough and Ready, so they were bound to live happily ever after. I remember her secretive smile like it was yesterday. I still have that old book, and have probably read it more often than Aunt Cora. No other book has ever captivated me to the point that modern customs and places are foreign, while I am at Tara, Twelve Oaks, Aunt PittyPats', and even Belle's! The best of all times for me.",
            "It was a tale beautifully told.I just finished reading it,and I can't get out of it's spell.The tragic end is absolutely perfect. I'm a person who likes everything to be pleasant,and I expected the end to be a happy one - like Scarlett saying &quot;I love you!&quot; to Rhett and Rhett hugging her and saying he loved her too.I'm not dissappointed,just heart-broken.I didn't cry like one customer says she did,but still the odd feeling in my stomach won't go away yet.As I said,I just put down the book and it's great,even though it left a sinking feeling in my stomach. I can't figure how I can really be happy for an hour or so with this emotion left from the book. Let me tell you - this book is so powerful.I loved it.I feel sadness and pity for Scarlett.It's good that nothing like this really happened and it's just fiction.If you're sad,think like this - it's just a tale,not true,(even though it seems terribly real) and it just added things to your outlook on life and to your literature knowledge. You don't want to lose a moment of your life mourning over a tale that didn't even exist,and Scarlett wouldn't want you to. :)) So just smile,and let that smile be a grateful one to Margaret Michell.She really changed you,didn't she?",

It is obvious that the author poured her entire being into this book and it is evident as you read that this story must have been very close to her heart as it always grabs hold of the hearts of countless readers. The book is written by an obvious historian and gives many details of the way of life of the people of the old south and the Civil War days as well. There is romance, a glimpse into the past, heartbreak, hope, triumph, struggle, life lessons, love, and the story of Scarlett O'Hara that will continue to live in the hearts of readers for generations to come.

            "This book has created intriguing characters. But the main characters like Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett are admired and glorified to a fault. Scarlett O'Hara is tough, practical and no-nonsense. But in essence, she's a villain with these qualities. She steals her own sister's boyfriend, emotionally abuses her children, marries men for money and spite, and cheats on everyone and anyone. Seems there's nothing she would not do for money and for herself. Surely she has certain qualities that are needed in a war to survive, but it's not the war that made her selfish to the core. It simply brings out her selfishness on a larger scale.",
            "I love this book. Scarlett is cunning and manipulative and sometimes ridiculous. But for all her flaws, she is a survivor and incredibly strong. Her story is beautiful, perfectly balanced and perfectly written.I so wish that Margaret Mitchell would have written more. Apparently one perfect book was enough for her, but it wasn't enough for generations of her fans!",
            "I've been pressured to read this book since about 5th grade. Everybody in my family has read it. I thought, \"What's so great about this huge book about the war? Boring.\" I finally picked it up this year. Definitely not boring.16 year old Scarlett O'Hara was not necessarily the most beautiful girl in Georgia, but her emerald eyes, 17 inch waist, and stubborn yet flirtatious attitude attracts all the men except Ashley Wilkes. The one man she thinks she truly wants. She has almost the perfect life; living on a huge plantation named Tara, and she's finally old enough to wear gorgeous dresses to various parties. She has the perfect slave, Mammy, keeping her in check throughout the story. Ashley has a party at his plantation, Twelve Oaks, to inform the town he is getting married to his cousin Melanie. Scarlett first puts on her flirt into overdrive to try to win him back, but when that doesn't work, she goes crazy breaking dishes and screaming while she should be upstairs napping with the other ladies. A mysterious man with a bad reputation just happened to be watching the whole thing. Rhett Butler. He was not intimidated by her like other men, he just laughed in amusement. But, the marriage does not stop Scarlett from getting what she wants. The Civil War doesn't either, it just greatly impairs it. Scarlett has to figure out how to live off of nothing and still keep her charm with the few men that are even around, not at war. She has to watch everything she loves break down to pieces before her own eyes; her family, Tara, and her wealth.Scarlett is such a brave character. She is a stubborn and selfish American heroine. She always says, \"I'll think about it later. After all, tomorrow is another day.\" This is an inspirational and true statement everybody should remember. People didn't know exactly how wonderful of life they had before the war, before they lost everything. I think all people experience this feeling. The knowledge that nothing will go back to the way it was. Miss Melly acts like nothing happened and hopes for the best. Scarlett on the other hand kept fighting herself and did things even a man wouldn't do to get her life back together again. She started her own business, married men for their money to help her family, and rode in carriages without an escort! That was scandalous and unheard of in the 1800s. It's the stubborn Irish coming out in her. She always wanted the best for herself. Not necessarily the people around her. But then there's Rhett who keeps popping up throughout the book giving Scarlett expensive gifts from Europe. Scarlett despises him for his smirks and smart attitude, but does she find she loves his sarcasm and money? Does she love him or hate him? You don't know until the last chapters.America was not joking when they voted Gone with the Wind as it's favorite novel. A classic. It's definitely a page turner. (All 1030 pages) You get a feeling of the other side of the Civil War. In history books the North was always the good guys. The Confederates hated the Yankees and their ways. I mean, who would want to have to free such devoted and motherly slaves like Mammy?This novel almost makes you mad because it doesn't go the way it's supposed to be. They should go back to being rich and happy! You want to pop into the book and get things all straightened out so it can be a happily ever after ending.I loved Gone with the Wind for many reasons. First of all, it made me realize that people in the old days were just the same as they are now. The characters are so real and have real life thoughts. Scarlett thought, \"If I have to steal or kill - as God is my witness, I'm never going to be hungry again.\" The people are not saying the perfect things at the perfect time like most books. Also, I loved the side stories with Scarlett's sisters, Ashley's relationship, the war, Rhett, the babies, and Scarlett's determination. It truly is one of the best books out there.",
            "Why is this novel the second best selling book in the world? Because every character evokes deep emotion to the reader whether love or hate. The complexity of the personalities written by Mitchell is amazing in itself, but place on top of that a writing style that flows like poetry and you've got in your hands the most fun a person can have with paper. Vivid descriptions of the Southern landscape, the Old South traditions, the Southern gentility, and the graceful way of life pre-Civil War are second to none. I have lived in the South my whole life and much of the lifestyle Mitchell relates in GWTW are accurate and still exist in one form or fashion. The South is the only true culture left in America and this is a window into how it began and what it was like in its peak. Traditions die hard down here but they are dying fast, get romanced by life south of the Mason-Dixon before it gets washed away in a flood of \"progress\".",
            "If you've ever read any classic like Pride and Prejudice you will love this novel. My friend once mentioned this novel was fantastic so I got my hands on a copy. Boy was I surprised to see how long it was and how small the font was. But it was completely worth it in the end. Margeret Mitchell really gets the point through with her novel. All the characters, such as Scarlett, feel so real throughout the whole book and everything is so thoroughly explained that you feel like your actually there. I also enjoyed the history in the book because I'll soon be studying the Civil War at school and this novel really helped me understand it in an enjoyable way.There are also many timeless lessons that are valuable for anyone.So anyone who loves romance, don't mind how long the novel is because in the end it's worth it. I urge you to go out and buy a copy NOW. :>",
            "To put it simply, this is the best book ever written. you have not lived until you have conquered this masterpiece of prose. For some, the length is intimidating, but it goes fast, so dont use that excuse. This book is a romance novel, a war story, a documentary all roled into one. there is something here for everyone.While reading this book, I found myself wishing so badly to be more like Melanie. Unfortunately, I am more of a Scarlett myself. I suspect most readers, if they are to be honest, would also admit to this. Yes, she is cruel, materialistic, unyeilding and rather spoiled. No, she isnt one to be envied. But still, there is something about her that one cant help but relate to. perhaps its because we watch her grow from a careless young lady to a hardened, stubborn adult. We know her story. we know her hopes and her fears and what drives her so far, and we cant help but admit that if we were in her shoes, wouldnt we have a similar response? all the same, one feels very little sympathy for her in the end, as she loses everything that matters, and is left with nothing but her money.Rhett, as another reviewer said, is certainly the tragic figure in this story. He is ultimately driven to accept the lifestyle that was originally so repulsive to him and that he worked so hard to avoid. ah, but for some there is some pride to be found in not being recieved! He loves Scarlett so much, yet due to her blindness to her own emotions, and the general reservations between them, their marriage fails. He tries to pour all the love and emotions he would otherwise show Scarlett onto Bonnie blue, but when she dies, there is nothing left for him. Its ironic, hes a big man, a strong man, a man to be afraid of...yet one almost cant help but to pity him.Great book.Read.",
            "Published in 1936, can any serious reader expect Gone With the Wind to mesh with 21st-century sensibilities? Of course not. Therefore, it may be wiser to open this book, put sensibilities aside, and let it rip because Gone With the Wind is simply a classic. Margaret Mitchell's Confederate sympathies hold little in the way of ambivalence. The dream-like plantation lifestyle, it's total devastation, and the abject humiliation of it's adherents under Reconstruction are starkly protrayed. Amidst the tragedy of civil war, Mitchell places a bevy of unforgettable characters whose inner strengths and weaknesses receive vivid definition - the interplay of which is truly sublime.Gone With the Wind is ultimately a story of traumatic loss and dogged perserverence, overcoming disaster, peeling oneself off of the cold, hard floor. To be sure, there is wicked condescension, biased justifications, premises so one-sided they defy belief, but through it all Gone With the Wind stands with Tolstoy's War and Peace in it's ability to bring the social costs of war to the surface in a manner both eloquent and disturbing. This book should be read by all. 5+ stars.",
            "GONE WITH THE WIND effortlessly uses the English language in ways I never thought possible, to tell the sweeping timeless story of a strong woman who stuck it out. People who say they don't like her are missing the point. Books are supposed to entertain, not preach. Scarlett may be selfish and stubborn and materialistic, but she is not boring. She lights up the pages with her vivacity. Give me an interesting heroine over a moral example any day.For more great books about Reconstruction in the South (and a girl who is in some ways exactly like Scarlett, and in others her polar opposite) go to littlecolonel.com and read the out-of-print Little Colonel series for free. Offers a new perspective on Scarlett's time.",
            "This is my favorite book of all time. Everyone should find time to read it. I realize it is 1024 pages of very small print and also that there are sixty-three chapters; however it is amazing. I realize too that it is in some cases a bit racist and there are people who are offended by that; to them, I privately say, \"Grow up\". Gone With the Wind is not about slavery. It is not about white supremacy. It is not even really about the South. It is about how war destroys people. You could take it and apply it to any war. I am by no means a white supremist, but those feelings need to be pushed aside while one enjoys such a wonderful book. I do not agree with Scarlett, or Melanie, or Ashley, or Rhett completely, but I can't help but tear up as I watch their world disappear again and again. It is a million times better than a history book to understand the causes of bigotry in the South after the war. As for Scarlett, she is infuriating, bullheaded, selfish, and childish, but I cannot help loving her anyway. Perhaps my favorite lines, though, come from Ashley, lost soul though he is:\"It's a curse--this not wanting to look on naked realities. Until the war, life was never more real to me than a shadow show on a curtain. And I preferred it so. I do not like the outlines of things to be too sharp. I like them gently blurred, a little hazy...It isn't that I mind splitting logs here in the mud, but I do mind what it stands for. I do mind, very much, the loss of the beauty of the old life I loved. Scarlett, before the war, life was beautiful. There was a glamor to it, a perfection and a completeness and a symmetry to it like Grecian art. Maybe it wasn't so to everyone. I know that now. But to me, living at Twelve Oaks, there was a real beauty to living. I belonged in that life. I was a part of it. And now it is gone and I am out of place in this new life, and I am afraid. Now, I know that in the old days it was a shadow show I watched. I avoided everything which was not shadowy, people and situations which were too real, too vital. I resented their intrusion. I tried to avoid you too, Scarlett. You were too full of living and too real and I was cowardly enough to prefer shadows and dreams.\"Everytime Ashley says what he truly thinks, it makes me cry. I never cry about anything, but I cry over Gone With the Wind. It's not that I want to be a part of that world, the pre-Civil War South, because I don't...it's just that Margaret Mitchell's words are magic, creating characters so real that I can't help but long for them to have what they want.",
            "...into the ad hoc matriarch of a shattered plantation family. Scarlett O'Hara makes you wince at her infuriating shallowness earlier in the story. You can spot it in a conversation between herself and Ashley Wilkes, the man she wants to steal away from Melanie Hamilton. Ashley comments that Rhett Butler (who Scarlett has just seen for the first time) looks like one of the Borgias. Scarlett asks which family they are--she doesn't know them. Ashley patiently explains that they're Italians. \"Oh,\" says Scarlett dismissively. \"Foreigners.\" The type of prideful ignorance that my own working class demographic (\"crackers\" back in those days) expresses like this; \"I'm dumb as hell and proud of it.\" One thing the movie doesn't capture by a long shot with Vivien Leigh as Scarlett and Olivia DeHavilland as Melanie is that these girls are teenagers, antebellum \"valley girls\". So actually, what do you expect? Basically, Melanie beats Scarlett out for Ashley's affections becase she is nowhere near as immature. But Scarlett's father frequently comments on her \"willfulness\", possibly without realizing himself that it's a clue to a titanic courage in his firstborn. In the ensuing story, the Civil War grinds up people and land. Melanie, Scarlett's onetime despised rival, becomes dependent upon her. Ashley is destroyed in spirit as well--a rich dandy doesn't have the moxie to endure war when it lands in his backyard. The main reason Scarlett ends up getting involved with Rhett is that he's the only man with her level of guts. Scarlett reminds me of Pat Conroy's \"Great Santini\" character--at first you can't stand her, you thank God no one like her is close to you, but when the chips are down, she's a survivor. And people associated with her survive as well. One thing this book points out is that the ugliness of war is a force of human nature, and people who think themselves insulated from it, or \"above war's barbarism\" wind up finding out the hard way that they're dead wrong. Now if only our present-day sheltered middle class and \"thinking people\" could face that inescapable truth...",
            "Gone With The Wind is one of my favorite books as well as a favorite movie. Margaret Mitchell has relayed thestory as though she was actually there. How does she know so many small details? Are they real or imaginary?Well, fiddle dee dee! They do seem real. This will be the 4th time that I have read the book. Saw the movieat age 14 on my first date. Cried and cried. And when we broke up that boyfriend told me that frankly, hedidn't give a damn.",
            "Loved the book. If only Rhett and Scarlett could have been on the same page at the same time. I know they loved each other. Scarlett is so strong if only she could have stayed out of her own way.",
            "I have read this book a few times, seen the movie 32 times, so I LOVE this book. I learn something new about the civil war and the customs of the time every time I read this story. It is so beautifully written. This particular edition I purchased is a true gem. It is beautifully bound and truly a book I can pass down through the years. It was every bit as good as the seller said it was!",
            "My most favorite book and move of all time. I had not read the book since high school and 50 years later, it still is my most favorite book. I also read &#34;Scarlett&#34; and &#34;Rhett Buttler's People&#34; - sequels to Gone with the Wind. Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!",
            "If you're like me and Gone with then Wind has ranked as your favorite movie of all time, you won't be disappointed with this read. All 1,037 pages while worth the read. And I was pleasantly surprised how much more detail and different the book was than the movie. As awesome as the movie was, the book is even better! A must read for all true southerns!",
            "Most incredible read. I highly recommend it to all age groups. So beautifully written it was so though I was brought to scene of the story.",
            "Love the book and the movie. The books so are I am only about a quarter of the way through but it is great",
            "An American classic historical novel. Not only a great story, but also lets you feel the changes wrought in society by the U.S. Civil War in and near Atlanta.",
            "Margaret Mitchell clearly captured the heart and view of the Confederacy during and after the Civil War. Her vivid descriptions of people and places make it easy to visualize the story. Her attention to detail and accuracy make GWTW believable window into the lives of 1860s Georgia.Her style of writing is easy to read and lazily draws you back to the Antebellum South until you find yourself an intimate observer of a lifestyle based on an economy of slavery. Mitchell's book doesn't apologize or campaign for the institution, it just presents a picture of what was.I find I revisit Gone With the Wind every ten years or so, and each read brings a new light to a classic novel.",
            "I read this book every few years. The reason I bought kindle version was to always have it. This is a classical historical novel. I would recommend this to everyone.",
            "I love Gone with the Wind. I love the experience of reading it than watching the movie. The book has a lot of characters that were not part of the movie. For example, Scarlett O'Hara had a son with her first husband, the brother of Melanie Wilkes.Another example, in the movie, during the escape of Atlanta, Scarlett, Rhett Butler, Melanie and her baby, and a slave escaped the burning city. The book includes a small boy slave (I forgot his name) who accompanied them to Escape from Atlanta and he has a role who was known to complain and nag Scarlett.I love the movie, but the book is very detailed with each character, especially their personality and family background.",
            "Preceding the Civil War, talk in Atlanta is rife with apprehension and speculation that warfare lies in the near future. Gone with the Wind revolves around the initially idyllic existence of a belle, Scarlett O'Hara, her unsteady marriage with the scandalous Rhett Butler, and her unforeseen reality during the heart of the Civil War. The sentimental page-turner demonstrates inspiring courage, outrageous fervor, and dramatic life alterations, in an emotional episode...brought to life!",
            "This books is one of my all time favorites that I read over and over again. Over the years I have bought many copies and love to give this book as a gift for birthdays. It also makes a great hostess gift! The descriptions in this book are so amazingly colorful and wonderful that you see the fabric, feel Scarlett's corset, taste the food. You run the whole gamut of emotions. Every time I read it, I laugh, I cry, I rage at Scarlett and fall in love with Rhett Butler. This book has always been an education and I always find something new to marvel at every time I read it. Buy this book, buy two and give one to a friend!",
            "I love this classic book. In the movie, the cast does a great job of making them realistic.However, several decades removed from the reading, I find something happening each time I hear the music, or see pictures of Rhett Butler. Romance, yes. But also an immense sadness. A sadness that suggests the main characters could change nothing even if they wanted to do so, that they were predetermined to fail. I hope we have more control over our lives than they.A second sadness emerges; the unending optimism of Scarlett. It begs the question: Could her life have been different if at any point she had accepted the inevitable? Tara really could not change the inevitable, but could she?I love this incredibly sad story, and appreciate the history it relives for us all.",
            "Absolutely my favorite novel. It's a long one, but everyone should read it...men and women. Not only is is accurate historically, but it is also educational and interesting. The novel is far richer than the movie, and although the motion picture is a spectacle....the book puts the movie to shame. Read the book, and watch the movie again afterwards. The differences are astounding....but that is what keeps the novel interesting to modern readers. It's isn't the exact story we have seen on film on TCM again and again. Again, everyone should read this book. It has literary value, historic value, and pleasure value.",
            "GWTW-I discovered it on the shelf of my highschool library & having never heard of it, I decided I would read it. I was completely unprepared for the ride! While we all want to be Melanie, the truth is-we're all a little Scarlett on the inside! I have since read the book many times (and of course own the DVD) and never tire of it. A definite book for gals-you get a glimpse into southern life at the time of the Civil War and experience a love story of enormous preportions. &#34;Fiddle Dee Dee&#34; is our catch phrase around the house! LOVED IT&#62;",
            "Not only is this book very moving, but it is one of the most popular historicals ever. Albeit, I did think it was long and I sometimes got tired of reading about struggle after struggle and pain over and over, this is the kind of book that shows the strength of people. When you get done with this book, it will leave you satisfied.",
            "Gone With The Wind is a passionate,heartthrobbing,beautiful,romantic tale.I saw the movie when I was 4 but it didn't make much of an impression on me because when I began reading it in bookstores when I was 6 I was immediatley enthralled with the story of Scarlett O'Hara,the sweet Southern Belle that when the War made many hard changes in her life she became a woman that did what she felt like and didn't listen to other peoples disapproval.Margaret Mitchell has brought many hours of joy to me as I read from her wonderful book every day of my life.I love Scarlett very much as the main character but Melanie is more dear to me.She is a beautiful,shining,kind woman that always saw Scarlett's and Rhett's good.She goes to show what we have lost from that era.Many people hate Ashley and think he's a wimp but that's only his potrayal in the movie.In the book,he is like Rhett but takes diffrent paths in the same situations.All the characters in this book,the lovely description,and the era make this book\"my favorite book of all time\".",
            "This is one of the most fascinating book that I have ever read.In its sweep, it focuses not only on slavery but also on the impact of war (however justified or inevitable) in people's lives. Scarlett's character is brilliant. Her transformation from a butterfly to a tough woman who loves her land, her struggles against poverty and her determination to rise above it, her passionate nature are just some of the remarkable features of this book. Its almost as if in the character of Scarlett, the author has put in all the dreams, hopes and aspiration of America of the mid 1800's. The description of life in the south makes the book all the more enchanting. Above all, its a great romance- A wonderful summer read. Scarlett's character, could be the voice of many women across the world even today.",
            "It has been said that all fantasy books are &quot;Lord of the rings&quot; progenies. If true, then all romance books have &quot;Gone with the wind&quot; roots. Every hero worth fantasizing about has Rhett's dash and every heroine seems to have Scarlett's spunk.I first read this book after years of loving the romance genre. It was already some 5 decades written and the author was long gone but I remember thinking: &quot;Wow, so this was how it all started.&quot;",
            "This is a book that really made me think about human nature, about how we sometimes get stuck with an idea, a person or a memoire that no longer is what we think it is. Like Scarlet spending her life loving Ashley with all her heart, but what she really loved was an illusion, ironically the illusion of what Rhett truly was.",
            "There ae some books you read, love and remember forever. This was one of them. If you hesitate to read this just because it is such a popular book, or you think that it's a romance novel, DON'T. I read it a couple years ago, well after I was out of highschool. I didn't think that I would care for it. Boy, was I wrong.I was hooked just a couple pages into the book. I felt like I knew these people. I could not put the book down. It was one of those books you just can't wait to read and you drag it with you wherever you go, in hopes of being able to sneak in a page or two.Read this book. It will leave an imprint on you. I wanted so much to keep reading after it stopped that I tried to read the &quot;sequel&quot; (written by a different author) and was unimpressed. I returned the book after reading the first paraghraph. There's nothing like Margaret Mitchell's Scarlet.",
            "Review of Gone With the Wind By Chris WilliamsThe novel ''Gone With the Wind'', by Margaret Mitchell, is one of the stories that has stood the test of time and is still loved by many people. It is used as a building block for many modern love and war stories. This story is about war and about a woman's struggle to obtain the man she loves, or the one she thinks she loves. The main character, Scarlet O'hara has an inner conflict of who she loves, while a civil war goes on around her. It's a traggic story of how she marries men while thinking she loves another, Ashley Wilkes. The other main character, Rhett Butler, really does love Scarlet more than anyone else, but when Scarlet finally realizes that she loves Rhett, and not Ashley, it's too late and he leaves her. Both Rhett and Scarlet are very selvish throughout the story. Rhett's only concern is how much money he can make off of the war, and all Scarlett cares about is trying to win Ashley's heart away from his wife, Melanie Hamilton. This plot kept me reading and it kept me very intrigued, I kept wanting to see what else would happen to keep Scarlet from realizing she loved Rhett. Scarlet's struggle and the loss of her and Rhett's daughter Bonnie were key factors in keeping this story exciting. I think anyone should read this book, boys or girls could enjoy this classic novel about love and war. It is one of the best books I have ever read in my life.",
            "I LOVE this book! It is one of the only books I know of where the dialogue is so great that the dialogue in the movie was taken almost word-for-word from the book! And this definitely was the perfect role for Vivien Leigh, one of my favorite actresses.I just acquired a 1936 hardcover version of the book. I love old books and this will go terrifically with my collection. I feel like this copy could be the one Vivien Leigh read over and over before she got the role. She kept telling everyone she was going to get it, and they kept trying tons of other actresses for the role, finally giving it to Vivien Leigh!Gone With the Wind is an epic novel of great proportion, set in the dwindling Old South. A southern belle who doesn't believe in war or anything but her own affairs strives to control her passion for a married man while marrying three men for money. Her third marriage, to Rhett Butler, is complicated by their passionate, obsessive love for each other, which makes the book and the movie what they are. A classic, the book is also contemporary because many women today can find their own selves in the book. I feel an affinity for Scarlett. Hopefully, many other women are like the wonderfully kind Melanie Hamilton.",
            "The thing i just love about this book is the fact that the novel is literally identical, to the film and that is no mean feat, at times it can grate slightly, but the book is so astoundingly written that you overcome that, she mitchell has that incredible deepness that only people from the deep south have when telling a story and no one else has the ability to convey.It has every thing war, when war was romantic,a dashing rogue of a hero, and of course the herione and was there ever a herione like scarlett o hara.One of the most important times in americas history and all this played in front of the backdrop of the deep south.in one word astounding.",
            "Easily the best piece of American fiction I have ever read. It is not only one of the most touching love stories of all time &quot; Did it ever occur to you that I loved you as much as a man can love a woman ?&quot; is one of most beautiful things I have ever heard a man say to a woman - it is an amazing depiction of Civil War history, told from the southern perspective. And Rhett just spoils you - because you keep comparing every man you meet with him and they just don't come even close. Despite the fact that I'm a woman, when I read the book, I identified far more with Rhett as a heroic character then I did with Scarlett, because he is so unabashedly honest about why he does things, and he has courage to say and do things because he believes in them, even if the community he is a part of is too shortsighted or too willfully blind to see the truth of what he says. Scarlett is just a hardheaded egocentric little brat, and the only admirable part of her personality is her neverending grit and determination to survive against all odds during Reconstruction despite incurring the wrath of her society. But personally despite the fact that Rhett thinks they're right for each other, because they're both rebels, I personally think she's too stupid for him, she just never thinks about anything except what she wants and how she's going to get it. But I suppose going by the time in which the book was written women were expected to be stupider than men. Of course, in some parts of the world, including where I come from, it's still considered a good thing. Rhett is the best thing that happened to Scarlett, that's definete, though whether she's the best thing to happen to him is questionable. Maybe if he'd been able to stretch her mind and her heart a little while they were married I would think she was good enough for him. Aside from the personal story which has resoundingly real characters and the epic tale of the Old South, this book ( and the movie ) serves as stunning anti-war statement. It makes you realize how terribly futile and a waste of effort, resources, and most of all people, war can be. Anyone who misses this book has missed out on something wonderful. And as far as the end is concerned, it was really no more then she deserved after ignoring him for years and years, but of course you do want to know they eventually end up together, because you know that they will make each other happy.",
            "If you're a fan of the movie, you HAVE to read the book. It is packed with details the movie doesn't even touch. Plus I think the book is actually more entertaining, believe it or not. Reading the novel enables you to better understand the principal characters and the environment of the Old South. The movie, even though it is 3 1/2 hours long, is really a huge abridgement of the novel. So much is missing from the film. After you've read the book you'll understand what I mean. Finally, if you do read the novel, prepare yourself, because it is quite long and requires concentration to keep track of the vast amount of characters and scenes. Anyway, this is the best novel I've ever read, and I generally don't read novels.",
            "In the book Gone With the Wind, Margaret Mitchell accurately portrays both the struggles and triumphs of living in the Civil War-torn South. Through the characters of Scarlett, Rhett, Ashley and Melanie, she shares with us the many opposing viewpoints of the Civil War. Gone With the Wind is a book that is timeless due to its amazing ability to stun readers with its stark truth. Everyone can relate to at least one character: hot-headed, poverty-fearing Scarlett; her husband, the child-doting blackguard Rhett; gentle, sweet Melanie, whose love for the Cause is greater than anything; and and Ashley, the hater of all wars. For these reasons, I rate Gone With the Wind five brilliantly shining stars!",
            "&quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; is one of my favorite stories. As a writer and publisher I admire not just the craft of Margaret Mitchell but also that of her publisher. You do not find such excellence in editing and proofreading in today's books. This is one of those books so good, you find yourself turning again to the first page as soon as you've finished it!--Linda Donelson, author of &quot;Out of Isak Dinesen: Karen Blixen's untold story&quot;",
            "This was the best book I have ever read. I admit that it starts out slowly, but the rest of the book is well worth it. After reading the first chapter, I thought it was the most boring book in the world. But I kept on reading because of all of the wonderful things I have heard about Gone With The Wind. I was unable to put this novel down! I was engrossed in the story of the Old South. I highly recommend this book. It will be an experience you will never forget!",
            "I am but 11 years old but I have read this book, and BELIEVE ME, it is definitely worth it. This book made me sob hysterically, laugh like a maniac, and understand what it was like to live during the Civil War. It actually made me wish I could have been alive during that time. My favorite character was definitely Melly. I won't spoil it for you but you have to read it.",
            "Wow, when i read this book i couldn't put it down! I actually saw the movie first,so when i read the book, I had an Idea what the charicters looked like. But i did not know that the movie was only half the story! I loved the movie just as much as the book, though others didnt. I have not read the sequal and im not planning to, from what i heard about it.My favorite charictor is Rhett. I dont know why. I think it is because whenever he popped up in the book, he always made me smile. I think that it was rhett and Melanie that made scarlett strong. They were standing behind her and pushing her along the way. Without them, Scarlett would not have been nearly as strong as she was. Gone with the Wind has some kind of charm that i cannot explain. From the first page it grabs you that no other book could posobly do. In this frenzy that we call our world, i know tht there was land of grace, beauty and, true love. Please read it!!",
            "What can I say? I LOVED this book. The characters were great, and the story was incredible! I love a book that can make you feel lots of emotions. I actually cried(a lot)! I don't do that a lot when I'm reading a book. It also made me feel happy, angry, blah blah, etc. The only possible downside is that the way slavery is depicted makes it seem better than it really was. But read it anyway, it's great!!! Oh, BTW, read the book first! It was so much better than the movie!",
            "I can truly understand why this book is so beloved to American culture. It has every single element of a great story written beautifully. The length may be daunting but I was surprised at what a &quot;short&quot; book it was to read. I absolutely loved Scarlett, though I wasn't so enthusiastic about melanie. If you haven't read it, you are MISSING OUT on something fabulous!",
            "This book is just wonderful! It's much better than the movie! I love how it is written, and how the charactors seem so real. Scarlett is so strong, but yet so misguided to what she wants. This isn't a perfect ending, but life doesn't always give a perfect ending, and that's what I like about GWTW. It's not a fairy story where everyone lives happily ever after, it's a story about live.",
            "I ablsolutely loved this book! It always kept me turning the pages. The descriptions were wonderfull and the story was the best ever!! This book will remain my favorite and it will always be remembered as a master piece. I recommend this book because I loved it and know you would too.",
            "This book is the best book i've ever read...it deserves more than a 5 star.I watched the movie last year and all i could remember is me smiling =) and crying =**|...it touched my heart! You've gotta read the book...you'll love it. Watch the movie too...it's a classic!***************************=)",
            "The novel Gone With the Wind was so beautifuly written that I cried at the end. This book descibes the south at the time before, after, and during the Civil War. It shows the strenth of a lady, Scarlett during these times. I love how Scarlett says at the end that she would think of it tomorrow at Tara. This is the best way Margrett Mitchell could have ended the book. Margrett did a outstanding job writting GWTW.",
            "Being a freshman in high school, my opinions are not usually taken for notice, however, I challenged myself in reading this book and found myself all the stronger a person for it. It truly gives the Southern point of view like nothing lese described to us Yankees. Amazing!",
            "i thought that this was a great book because it was a trying time in our history, and through that one woman got through everyhting. loosing her mother, father, and almost her land, that her father won, and worked. throgh everything, scarlett got her life back. even though the way she did it was not a great way. but rhett was great to her, and she realized that she really loved him when nothing else could be done. too little too late.",
            "Me being 11yrs. old didn't think that I would like this book. Boy was I wrong. This is my favorite book of all time! The only thing that I didn't like about the book which I know almost everybody will agree with me on is that it ends so suddenly not even giving you a hint to the outcome. Margaret Mitchell is so good that she can even capture an eleven yr. olds mind with an adult book. This book is easy to put people you know in the characters spots and just sit there all day and daydream a new ending. Did I mention that I loved this book?",
            "I first read GWTW, when I was just a kid and fell in love with it from the first line. No other book has come close to how I feel about this novel (save for Pride and Prejudice, Persuasion and Rebecca all running close seconds!)If you have only seen the movie version of this book, please do yourself a huge favor and read the book. It is amazing! Scarlett has so much more depth as a person than the way she is portrayed in the movie (Vivien Leigh was a perfect Scarlett don't get me wrong) You will come to understand her motives completely if you just read the Book! Apparently I cannot stress this enough. This is just the best book ever written!",
            "Ok, here's the deal. This book was great. I mean GREAT! I read it in 6th grade. The whole thing was so, so, so wonderful! I luved every bit of it, Except for.....the end. I hated the end! Why did she just leave us hanging? I mean Tomorrow everything will be alright? What kind of ending is that? So I had to get Scarlett. I luved Scarlett too. And I was glad that there was actually an ending, but the ending was kind of boring.",
            "This book was beautifully written, and had just the right amount of romance, action, drama, and loneliness that it became a captivating novel. I could not put this one down. It is unforgetable.",
            "Gone With the Wind is the best book I've ever read! It is breathtaking and thrilling. It describes the civil war along with Scarlett's life during it. It is a really wonderful book that takes you back in time. I loved this book. I am only 13, and I think anyone my age should read this book, because it rocks. It is sad, but still its the best. Read it, and I know you'll love it",
            "&quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; was one of the most exciting books the I have ever read. I really like the part when Ashley all of a sudden has feelings for her. But, the best part about the book is how I could not put the book down. I first read the book 5 years ago when I was in the fifth grade, but then I re-read it last year. I understood it even more. I am now trying to give it to people so that they can read it. It is also one of my favorite books. I recommend this book to anybody, male or female, young or old. So enjoy &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;.",
            "I noticed that there are no Arabs casting their opinions, so i am glad to give you mine. When i was 14, my father gave me a special edition for the youth, and told me:&quot; read this book, you will enjoy it&quot;. Well, ladies and gentelmen i started reading it in Thursday afternoon, and i didn't put it untill Friday night. The book is simply wonderfull, and later when i was growing up (i am 28 now) i read the full version two more times, and some passages ( especially the first encounter between Scarlet and Rhett at the library)countless times. I think the strength of the book lies in its strong and very believble characters ( although i think there is little exaggeration in the power and charm of Rhett). The supporting characters are very believble as well, and although you might think that there is huge diffrence between USA and the Arab world, but the truth is we are people, and apart from few diffrences, the basic emotions, and behaviour are almost the same, that is why the book has such an enourmous success in all the world and with all ages and throughout its history. And as one of the reviewr pointed, that each country knew some major changes to its society, another reason why the book was a huge success. As for the romantic story, it is very powerfull as well. Finally, i would like to say, that i am almost Copy of Ashely Wilkes( without the skill of riding ..lol), and usualy i like the types of Melanie, but you can't help your self and admire Scarlett as a fiction heroine, although i doubt very much i would like her if i met her. I personaly strongly recommend this book.BUT i would like to make a warning for everyone thinking of reading the sequell, because the sequell is no more than a litreature piracy in my opinion, and it is a pure rubbish, and you can better buy a cheap romantic novel insted.I woul love if someone sent me an e mail.",
            "This book is even better than the movie--really! I began reading this as an escape from a pretty hectic time in my life, and couldn't put it down for about three days, until I got Scarlet out of the danger of the war. This novel combines romance, strength, family loyalty, love of home, and many other values into one exciting story. Definitely check this out!",
            "This is not the type of book I usually read. I am into Mary Higgans Clark and John Grisham. I only read this book because of school, and thought that I could sort of skim through it. Well after the first sentence I couldn't help but read every page word for word. This book is a page turner if I've ever seen one. You would think that the ending would be annoying, because it is so open, but I love it. I won't ever read the sequel because it could never even come close to the book. No matter hot good it is GWTW will be a thousand times better. I read this book in 10 days. That's like 100 pages a day, but I even forgot there were 1000 pages. You get so involved in the romance of Scarlett and Rhett that you could care less of the thickness of the book. I you haven't read this book, your are missing out on not only the greatest love story ever, but the greatest novel ever written. I picked up the book thinking that I had to read a book during the summer and that with all the talk about this one I might as well try it. I soon realized that ever positive review I have read about it can't come close to describing this book.",
            "This is my all time favorite book. I read it in the eigth grade and since them I have read it several times. I first started reading this book because of the movie, but after reading the first few hundred pages, I virtually forgot that there was a movie. The 1939 movie with Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable is spectacular but Mitchell's book surpasses that greatness. This is the novel that proves the saying that the book is always better than the movie.I have read all the reviews that people have published on this site and it amazes me that anyone gave GTWT less than five stars. I couldn't put this book down!Gone With the Wind is romance to the highest degree and it only improves each time I read it. Scarlet's encounters with Rhett are my favorite part of this book. Everytime they meet it draws me in. The thing that makes this book great however, is that it isn't just about romance, it is about survival and although Scarlet isn't the nicest person like Melanie, it is hard to not root for her. She does everything all the way and never holds back what she is feeling.",
            "Gone With The Wind is a timeless romance that depicts agreat picture of what life was like during and after the Civil War. Once loved by all the men in the County, Scarlett's life takes a turn after the war. She ends uo in Atlanta where her reputation is ruined by gossip. The ending was kind of disappointing, but it leaves plenty of room to imagine what could happen. There is something for everyone to relate to in this book. I have no doubt that this book will always be remembered as the greatest romance novel of all time.",
            "This was another book to be read and studied in English class. Every one of my peers thought that this book was going to be like most of the other books that we had had to read that year, but I wasn't so sure, as I was just beginning to learn to love the classics and literature books in the library. So, being curious, I read the 1024 page book in under a week, and I found it a marvelous book. It touches wonderfully on the hardships and problems of the civil war years in the South, and the feelings of the proud Southerners toward the Yankees and slaves after the war had ended and they found themselves stripped of their old ways of the plantation living (this book mainly touches on the lifestyles of the richer plantation owners, rather than the majority of Southerners, or the poor ones who owned just a little farm, and often no slaves). It centers around the story of Scarlett O'Hara, daughter of a great lady and a rich Irish plantation owner. It is a funny and charming story of Scarlett's love problems: she can have any man that she wants in the South, yet she wants an engaged man! The book goes through her funny predicaments and actions as she struggles to stay alive in the present, with her dreams of the past behind her...It also goes on about a notorious man named Rhett Butler, who associates himself with Scarlett, and yet who is not accepted in any home in Atlanta, Georgia, nor the South for that matter. This book is recommended to anyone who likes romance stories or books with heroines in them. In fact, I recommend this to anyone who can stand reading long, wonderful books.",
            "Gone With the Wind takes place in the 1800's and is about an American girl named Scarlett O'Hara trying to fit in Atlantas society . Scarlett is a ordinary girl who just seems to bend the rules a little.She goes to parties and balls like all other girls. The Civil War starts and turns her world upside down. She has to learn to do things that women don't do but she does it just to survive. She learns to work the fields, runs lumber mills,and a store. Society throws her out because she is doing things women wouldn't dare do even to survive. She has to deal with all the hardships of war.She loses many loved one due to fighting and starvation. While all of this is happening she meets a man named Rhett Butler who helps her tremendelsy. He picks her up from all of her troubles and survive and tries to get back her place in society. I would recommend this book for anyone who likes romance novels.",
            "Gone with the Wind is a classic that everyone should read. This book is filled with romance, adventure, and hope. Watch Scarlett weave her way through different husbands and lovers while trying to keep her family alive. As opposed to Melanie, Scarlett is rather self-centered and never really changes, she does not care what anyone thinks of her and is prepared to do her own thing. Melanie is a loving, caring, considerate young women who always wants the best for everyone, including her husband, Ashley and Scarlett. I think that this is a great book that is really worth reading. There is constatantly hope for better times, even when better times have come.",
            "Being a Atlanta belle myself and seeing the movie many times I decided to read the book. The begining was quite boring, but after I to page 300 or so I really started to enjoy the book. I really like it and was really sad when it ended, but some or the things I didn't understand. Scarlett really seemed to marry Frank for his money, but she also seemed to love him because she gave him a kid and she slept with him for a couple of years. She seems to dislike her kids, but at times she acts like she couldn't leave them for anything. I really felt sorry for Rhett in the end because in the movie he doesn't tell how much he loves her. The movie doesn't really interpret how bad Scarlett's live was effected by the war. I really loved the book and really wished Margaret Mitchell had a chance to write a second book.",
            "I had seen the movies like 20 thousand times when I decided to read the book. I got to about page 250 when I stopped uninterested. About three months later on a dare I checked out Scarlett and started to read it. I really loved it, but many of the characters mentioned were people I had never heard of in the movie. Very confused and wanting to get it all figured out I got GWTW and started to read it again. This time I made myself keep reading and after about page 400 it started to get really interesting. I read from page 400 to the end in two and a half days and was terribly upset when it ended. I think this a great book and know I am on a search for ever Civil War book written.",
            "I just finished this book and LOVED IT! The development of the book is great. The character development is great. IT'S JUST GREAT! Yet when she argues with Ashley it get's oh so gooey! If you want to read it but freaked by the fact that it's 1036 pages, trust me, Mrs. Mitchells writing style is easy and american and you'll be under its spell in no time!",
            "Gone with the Wind lived up to its reputation and then some. It is a story of the south at the time of its fall. It is a story of Scarlett O'Hara and her journey from being a immature Southern Bell to a mature intelligent women. It is a fantatisc romance novel.",
            "I read it when I was 11 and I could hardly put it down, it took me 5 days to read this amazing book. Sure there is a dead spot in the middle and it gets a little depressing, but it is worth the read. I recommend this book to anyone who likes civil war romance.",
            "I read Gone with the Wind last summer and could not put it down...and then I read it again. I've read many great books in the classic genre, but none have been able to captivate me as Gone with the Wind has. Mitchell paints her characters so vivdly that as you read about their hardships during the Civil War and Reconstruction you just want to cry. Gone with the Wind is truly one of the best books ever written.",
            "This was the best book I read in a while. Even though it is long, it is a beautiful love story of Scarlett O'Hare and Rhett Butler. It is a learning experience for all readers. A must read! I can't wait to read Scarlett: The Sequel!",
            "I read it when I was 11 and my opinion was, and still is, &quot;pretty good, for a romance.&quot; But it's probably just me, because I'm more into science fiction and mythology. bit of a difference, isn't it? P.S.- if you really liked GWTW, don't read the sequel, _Scarlett_. I'll tell you, it's pretty different from what I imagined.",
            "Even though I am only thirteen, I am still able to grasp the grandeur of this novel. It is truly one of a kind.",
            "This book is extraordinary! It is truly a brillant piece of literature. To any one who has never read this book, you need to read it. The movie is good, but the book is so much better!Scarlett O'Hara is the epitome of a selfish, spoiled brat . . . but you just gotta love her",
            "Margaret Mitchell was my Great-Great Aunt. From her, I inherited some of my facial characteristics,and also a talent for writing. I first read my aunts book when I was in 7th grade, and fell head over heels in love with it. It was a story that depicted the life from a southern point of view. In a vast majority of the Civil-War era novels, the Confederates are made out to be unruly rebels. Not ALL southerners were like that. Take The O'Hara family for example,did not treat their slaves badly, as many southern plantation owners were made out to be. I'm not denying the act of slavery as being horrible, for I know that it was, but at the same time, Margaret showed both sides. She showed the hardships and difficulties, loves and pleasures of southern life, and for that I am unbelievable proud to say that I am her blood.",
            "Not a bad novel for a first writer. It could almost be a classic except for a few points - a) it's unecessarily long and could have used more editing; b) the second half is weak and not very interesting; c) it's description of Reconstruction is very one-sided and half-correct and d)it's too racist. Other than that, it's not bad.",
            "Thank you for the promptness in sending this out. It got here just in time for the birthday party I was giving this item at! Thanks again!",
            "I love Gone with the Wind! It is a beautiful and wonderful story to read over and over again!",
            "The book matched the picture on the site, which was important to me. It was delivered as described and on time.",
            "About twenty years ago, when I was a teenager, I read this book, here in Brazil.Today, I don't like to read any kind of fiction, but remembering what I thought then, I have to give four stars for it.Another american author of fiction, Sidney Sheldon was nothing, compared to the american woman that wrote this book.Good, but too long, fiction.Good art doesn't gets older.",
            "This book was very well written. It was a classic. I was intrigued at how well Margaret Mitchell spun this story together. Scarlett was a character that had so many different characteristics about her than I doubted it would ever end. You meet Scarlett O'Hara in Tara and soon you find out of her passionate love for Ashley Wilkes. War is declared on the South and Ashley marries his cousin Melanie Wilkes. Scarlett becomes jealous and as a way to get back at him she marries Melanie's own brother, Charles Wilkes. Charles and Ashley go to war leaving Melanie in Atlanta and Scarlett in Tara. Shortly after Scarlett gets a telegram informing her of her husbands death. She is desperate to get out of black widow's clothes. She goes to Atlanta to stay with her Aunt Pittypat while she tries to get used to wearing all black and never dancing. There they meet Rhett Butler for the first time. Soon Scarlett realizes shes pregrant with her dead husbands baby. Scarlett has the baby fine with no troubles. The Southern army passes through Atlanta and Ashley visits Scarlett and Melanie. Melanie gets pregnant. Nine months pass by and Melanie is deathly ill and is going to have the baby shortly. Siege is laid on Atlanta while the baby is near coming. Scarlett is forced to deliver the baby for all the doctors were busy with wounded soldiers. Scarlett takes charge and Melanie, Scarlett, Beau(The newborn), and Scarlett's child all flee to Tara. After a ravaging journey Scarlett makes it safely. After Scarlett sets up Tara to running again her and Melanie go to Atlanta once more. Ashley returns and Scarlett decides to marry her sister's bethrothed, Frank Kennedy, for his money. She uses his money to keep Tara running and she starts her own Lumber mill, something unheard of before this time, a woman working was taboo. Her husband and Ashley go to a Klu Klux Klan meeting and Ashley gets shot and Frank dies by a bullet to his head. Rhett goes and gets Ashley and saves him from the Northern army by pretending that Ashley had been visiting Belle Watlings house of 'ill repute'. Rhett proposes to Scarlett and they visit New Orleans and many places. Scarlett is happy. Then she has a baby girl who Rhett dotes on. Scarlett and Rhett fight a lot over silly things and then Rhett lets the girl jump with her horse and she falls, breaks her neck, and dies instantly. Rhett and Scarlett fight and Rhett comes home drunk one night and they have a few 'passionate' moments and Rhett leaves for good. He comes back and Scarlett tells him shes pregnant. He says rude things and she lunges for him, misses and falls down some stairs. She has a miscarriage and Rhett leaves with his famous line. \"Frankly my dear, I dont give a damn,\".",
            "Everyone knows this story, even without reading the book so I thought I'd add a bit about Mitchell's racist attitude towards the slaves. There are conversations amongst Scarlett and her family/friends regarding the Northern's erroneous assumptions about their slaves. They claim that they would never beat their slaves nor know of anyone that would behave that way. Of course we know that slaves were abused but there is huge denial here. Mitchell's characters also portray the slaves as child like, and the owners justify slavery saying that the Negroes are too child like to take care of themselves. Also remember that the men in Scarlett's lives are part of the KKK. Mitchell sees the group as Southerners protecting their family.It's astounding how much of this attitude is not commented upon. We could all learn that Mitchell's attitude is the type of thinking that people used to justify slavery and the treatment of Blacks after they were freed.Of course the novel itself is full of compelling characters, even if it is at heart a soap opera. Scarlett and Rhett are drawn so deeply that they feel that you would know them if you encountered them. By all means read the novel, but don't dismiss the racism.",
            "Margaret Mitchell may have only written one book, but she well deserved the awards she won and the praises bestowed upon her. I have read this book twice and was taken aback both times by her colorful yet brutally honest account of the Civil War, mixed with her artful and often humorous accounts of emotion and the social expectations of the period. This book is truly an \"objet d'art\", a wonderfully sculpted work, that is ageless and timeless. It takes one's breath away with its mix of humor and brutality; its insight of human behavior, propriety, pride, vanity, and patriotism. This book, and the part of her soul (a great part, I may add), will never die.",
            "On the one hand, Gone with the Wind is a wonderful novel. Scarlett O'Hara is probably one of the best female characters I've ever read in a classic novel. She is not nice. She is not good. And yet, the most interesting characters rarely are. Melanie Hamilton Wilkes and Ellen Rollibard O'Hara were wonderful women, but the point of Scarlett is she will never be that woman. She's resourceful. She's \"a scoundrel.\" When the women of the South are thrown out of their comfortable lives Scarlett claws her way back to the top - and doesn't learn until the very end that she lost everyone for it. Her determination is her greatest asset and her biggest tragedy. But at the end, when she has lost everything, she decides to keep going as always.On that same hand, it's a wonderful story. The five parts are set up like a Shakespearean Play. Margaret Mitchell, for all her faults, is a wonderful writer and her descriptions put you in the story. She's also an intelligent enough writer to be able to write from the viewpoint of many different people, even if she mostly sticks with Scarlett's point of view.But on the other hand, the descriptions of slavery are offensive. While I believe that there were probably some benevolent plantation owners and some slaves that wanted to stay with their families (although, in the novel, it's interesting that the \"house\" slaves - the ones who lived with the family day by day and recieved many more privilages - are the only ones who care to stay while the field hands leave as soon as possible), slavery was indeed a horrible institution. And the novel does seem to argue that it was all better before with slavery (although the North gets the brunt of the blame for wrecking things - even though the South are blamed for starting it). Also, some of the heroes of the novel are Klan members, and the only criticism of their choice is that it's \"too dangerous\" and \"not the way to get things done.\"As offensive as these thoughts may be to modern sensibilites, the novel still remains a great work of art. I resisted reading this book for a long time, but now I'm glad I did. For all its faults, I highly recommend it.",
            "Ok, wow! What a great book! I first saw &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; on a classic movie channel, and now I've read the book. If you buy it, you will not put it down - I mean I read 1041 pages in 3 days! This book will make you cry, for Rhett and Scarlett and is the best book I've ever read. It will make you cry so much, and personally, I really disliked Ashley for leading Scarlett on. This book is NOT racist, and it will give you a sense of romance better than Titanic ever could! The book describes Rhett's eyes, and make him come to life soooo much, and at the end it's sooo sad. Which is why I'm going to buy the sequel! Beware it leaves you hanging. Possibly the best book ever written EVER! BUY IT!",
            "I never really considered reading this book before and I'd never seen the movie. I'd intended to, see the movie that is, but I'd never even thought about reading the book until a friend had it sitting around and wasn't reading it so I said \"what the heck, what's the drama all about?\".Having the forward done by Pat Conroy certainly helped as he is one of my favorite all time authors, so I dug in. I can't believe I'd never had this book recommend to me before, especially since I'm an outspoken hater of Lincoln (may he and Sherman burn in hell forever). I mean I really hate murderous invaders so hating Lincoln is easy, I never understood how people can make a hero out of both Washington (fighting for self rule) and Lincoln (invading to stop self rule), but I digress.What was really amazing about this book is that Mitchell managed to give a history lesson and wonderful historical flavor without ever actually \"telling\" the reader, she just \"showed\" us and it was wonderful and delightful to read.The is so much rewritten history and people really don't understand much of what they believe or even why they believe it so anyone that thinks they know the about the invasion of the South in the War of 61 and they haven't read this, they are not being honest in what they say they know, they can't be. The way the characters show how life was compared to what we are often taught or simply left to believe because we view things through modern lenses is really an amazing feat and the reason why this is such a good novel.Now to the love and the hate and the clash of personalities and the human nature and on and on, I can't say enough about how great this book is. So much popular modern writing is just trash, or fluff, compared to this depth of characterization, and here's a little clue why: modern writers tend to give us hero's with minor flaws, Scarlet is written very sympathetically, one can't help but love her, and love her deeply in fact, yet she's often wicked, she's certainly totally self absorbed and in modern times we'd probably call her a complete narcissist, BUT we the reader simply can't help but love her.The race relationships in the book are very insightful and give the reader understanding into the culture and mores of the time, and read with a view to the future one can see the root of much of today's racial problems in America, the South was destroyed by the North, the slaves may have been freed in one quick stroke, but they were free for what? The economy was destroyed, enormous wealth was destroyed, and the seeds of resentment and hatred were watered, not just in the hearts of the Southern white upper classes, but in the Northern whites, the poor, the blacks and everyone that suffered huge loss by the actions of state in it's conquest for power.I wish I'd read this book sooner, but now that I have I'll continue to recommend it to any one interested in a great novel of American and Confederate history, and of love, love the universal, the love of family, the love of a woman. Love and hatred, two sides of the same coin and separated by slivers of fate.",
            "Margaret Mitchell's classic may be an historical novel, but it is packed with the truth of what was done to a peaceful and blameless section of our Country. Most people do not realize the huge numbers of Europeans (unsuccessful in their Revolutions of 1848)who came to this Country, were given enlistment bonuses (when fresh from the boat) and allowed to wreak havoc on a people whom they held responsible for all of their miserable conditions. Mrs. Mitchell weaves an excellent story, filled with characters who are relevent, even in today's world, while utilizing, as a backdrop, one of the world's greatest tradgedies. It is obvious that Mrs. Mitchell used a large number of primary sources in writing her book, and it deserves to be placed at the top of every literate person's reading list.",
            "I purchased this as an ebook as I already own a 1936 copy of the book and a hardback copy for reading.Gone With the Wind is a timeless classic that I have read probably a dozen times. I never tire of the story and the author is amazingly descriptive. This is not your typical love story and it leaves you wanting more.",
            "I absolutley LOVE this book. It is not only the precedence setter for Historical Fiction, but it also paved the way for women writers to be recognized.Margaret Mitchell took a great many chances on the situations, characters, and \"scandals\" presented in this epic story of the Old South.It is the standard upon which all modern literary historical-romance fiction books are based.Good strong characters (many who were not even mentioned in the movie), and a story that is perfect for any season to read.Go ahead...buy the book in Hardback. This book accompanied me to war in the Middle East, and from its characters, I have continually found \"something new\". While you are at it..go ahead and purchase Donald McCraig's Rhett Butler's People. Make sure you read Gone with the Wind first, then set your engine speed on high...you are about to go into overdrive!",
            "This is one of the best fictions I have read in American literature. It narrates the personal struggle of our not always likable but always resilient and resourceful heroine Scarlett O'Hara, and her relationship with the cynical and worldly Rhett Butler. It is also a sweeping saga of the people of the American South (mostly two locales in Georgia: Tara Plantation and Atlanta), spanning from antebellum to Civil War to the Reconstruction. Michell's writing is superb; it is full of details and nuances to the southern life, especial life in the plantations and life in Atlanta. The personalities of the characters are consistent and believable. Even descriptions of minor events and characters are vivid, such as the conversion between Gerald O'Hara and Mrs. Tarleton and her daughters on the way to the barbecue, from the chorus of the girls' shrieking and arguing you really get a rich and lively picture of antebellum Southern life. Of course, we shouldn't confuse the author's nostalgic and overly-romanticized view of Southern plantation life with reality, but this is a fiction, not a historical study. I find it hard to fault the author for painting a picture from the perspective that she chose (that is, a white plantation owner's perspective), just like you cannot criticize a painting of peaceful rural scenery for not exposing the garbage dump and outer house.But the book is not without flaws, and I see two major ones:1. Racism. I don't think anyone can really defend the author for this. It is one thing that her characters say and think in racist terms, but she also expressed such opinions numerous times in the narrator's voice. Some defend her by saying that it is because of the time (1920s-1930s) that Michell wrote this book; that may be true, but it does not exempt her from such criticism. I would rather say it is a \"flaw of her time\" than \"not a flaw because of her time\".2. The reconstruction part (Part Four) of the book is a little dragging. Some tangential characters such as Will Benteen and Archie introduced in this part are an awkward fit to the storyline and they certainly do not add much to the central plot (not surprisingly, they were completely eliminated in the movie). In this period Butler's role also became more shadowy, except at the end when he rescued the men from their ill-fated Shantytown revenge. I get a sense that Mitchell was really critical of the reconstruction and she was just drawing this out to give herself more room to air her criticism.Nevertheless, even with these flaws, it is really an exquisitely crafted piece of work. It will always have its place in the Alta of American literature.",

            "The first time I read this book many years ago when I was still in high school and did not take the time to appreciate the book like I should have. Now that I have purchased this book and have re-read it I have fallen in love with the character of Scarlet. Although it is a long book, it is totally worth it.",
            "It is as powerfu ltoday as it was when it was written. The Old South is described with such detail, it takes your breath away",
            "I have loved this book since I first read it in high school and of course the movie too. Margaret Mitchell paints so vivid a picture of the South and their culture. The story between Scarlett and Rhett is timeless and classic. You will never find 2 people so made for each other. I love how in the end Scarlett and Rhett do not end up together and he ends up leaving her. I reread this book at least once a year and it I feel gets better and better every time I read it. This book has everything: action, romance and love and some of the best character development I have every read. I love this book.",

Somehow I lost my book ina move, and saw it for sale on Amazon, and couldn't wait for it to comein the mail.I was very pleased to receive it in excellent condition ! Even though Ihave read it 3 times before, it intrigues me, and I can't put it down.I love the characters Rhett Butler and Scarlet O'Hara. I have the sequelScarlet and find that book is also very enjoyable, However NOT as muchas Gone with the wind. I will never loose my book again. I'm passing itdown to family who I hope will make this a keepsake.thanks. katie",
            "The book was well written but personally I liked the movie better. Yes the book was about many things but the part that urked me was the romanticized view of the South's struggle with \"the low class treacherous Yankees\" and the so called uppity negroes. Oh how insolent and thirsty these \"brutes\" were for any thing white in a dress (southern propaganda of the reconstruction era and of Mitchell's own era.) Mitchell leaves out the fact that almost every Southern slave owner was himself only a gentleman during the day but at night was more treacherous to black womanhood than any \"darky\" ever was to that of white womanhood. Unfortunately many Americans know very little about history and therefore will sadly accept the lies and fantasies that Mitchell's book has exposed our society to. As I stated earlier, it was well written and I took great pains to read it in its entirety waiting for the point in which Mitchell's account of the South would be fair and balanced (since the movie wasn't so bad) but unfortunately it seemed Mitchell really believed that blacks who had been stolen from their homeland, whipped for not picking someone else's cotton fast enough, raped by their masters, abused by jealous mistresses were supposed to turn around after being freed and say \"thankee Massuh fo' all dat ya dun dun fo' me.\" Thank goodness for Alex Haley's Roots!",
            "oh god the ending! the ending! the ending!(it is best to read the book before you watch the movie)",
            "As angela camack pointed out, the film &quot;gone with the wind represents the institution of slavery as a walk in the park. The fact that the movie lasted over a period of years and it rarely showed a violent act towards a Black person is solid proof. The truth of the matter is that slavery in the deep south, likes places such as south carolina, was incredibly brutal and violated most human rights. The film attempted to depict slavery as a life where none of the slaves got beaten, whipped or raped, when in reality violent acts towards Black individuals was a common day occurrence. According to Frederick Douglass slaves were beaten weekly to strike fear into the other slaves. Women were raped continually over years of their lives in order to perpetuate the institution of slavery. Families were torn apart from each other due to the trading and selling of slaves. Gone With the Wind could have done a little more justice to Black Americans by not under emphasizing the torture and pain that they endured during the 19th century.Apart from its ignorant illusion of slavery the movie does illustrate, as Mark Burgh points out, the hardships of post Civil War life in the south. Scarlett O'Hara never had to do a thing for herself before the war. By the time Sherman was done marching to the sea she had made up her mind that she was going to conform to the new northern way of life in order to survive under the new politic. A lot of people in the south had to make that change, and I think that movie does an excellent job of showing the changes in life style before and after the war",
            "but it works, mainly because of Scarlett and Ashley, who are engaging if limited characters. Rhett Butler begins as interesting but is ultimately tiresome. Mammy is engaging, Prissy less so. The less said about Melanie and Ellen the better. Don't count on it as history lesson, either. Really, it's not much more than a well written bodice ripper (which explains why it has so many adolescent fans) but bodice rippers are often fun.",
            "Margaret Mitchel wrote only one book in her life. \"Gone With The Wind\" not only won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1935, but the film version won Best Picture in 1939 - opposite \"The Wizard of Oz\". Mitchel never wrote again, though in the mid 1940's she was struck by an automobile on Peachtree Street in Atlanta and her body was dragged for more than 100 feet.Her fiuneral was more majestic than Scarlet and Rhett's wedding.a signed first edition of this book today is worth well over $15,000.As for the new introduction written by Pulitzer Prize winner, Pat Conroy (\"The Prince of Tides\") He is, after all a Southern Writer and his own material is considered literature. I'll leave his words up to you. I respect his work a great deal. Even if not his opinion. And that's all an intorduction or a review is; a critic attempts to establish crredability with words. and in seeking out a Soutern Writer, though there are dozens of well qualified women writers (Lett's, Flagg, Kingsolver) With Styron, Clemens and Faulkner gone we are left with Conroy and John Grisham. I'd be interested to know what all of these people would write in an introduction.\"Gone With The Wind\" is a terrific story, fairly well written and highly emotional. It is one of the few war novels in history written from a woman;s perspective (that includes battle scene action) and the character of Scarlet O'Hara- our protaganist and ingenue - has become an adjective in describing other characters. In some ways, this novel; is a huge step forward for the feminist movement, but far more so it set the civil rights movement back subsgtantially and continues to every single time someone reads it. People read that book and actually believe that slaves were treated like family members. Mitchell writes about Mammy and Poke and Prissy passing along the perfumed hearsay her grandmother told her that the \"houise darkys\" are given \"family status\" but still Scarlett's frustration over Prissy's idlesness causes her to threaaten to break a switch acorss her back. Miss Scarlet runs into Big Sam as the Confederate Army leaves Atlanta to the Yankees while Scarlet must stay to bring Melly's baby (A love promise she made to Melly's husband)He is a Field Hand but she speaks with him because he is an overseer and only becausee the Yankee's canons and guns can be heard on the hprizon. She gaters information and does not wish him well;she will never see him again and as readers we never hear of him again. Neither the book nor the film do anything to expose what slavery was and the way in which \"Gone With The Wind\" has injured the rights for descendents of America-slaves is sinceely nauseating.There are millions who would break a switch across my back for this review. I saw go to it,k but you'd better re-read thge book before you do it. Perhaps watch the film as well, as it is less harsh than the book. (I own the screenplay)So by all means, everyone should read \"Gone With The Wind\". The more controlversial, the more one should read. But before you do, read Alice Walker's \"The Color Purple\" which also won the Pulitzer Prize. I've taught these books together as WAlker's also takes place in the South in 1935 and gives a clear idea of what life was like for the once-slaved,now impoverished. Thern read GWTW. After you get all teary and warm with \"Gone With The Wind\"(and you will be) then you must read William Styron's \"The Confessions of Nat Turner\", also a Pulitzer Prize winner, which was written in 1966, utilizerd what little is known of the trial of Nat Turner and tells us more truth about what it was to be a slave. If after that you still haven't gotten the picture pick up the recently published book about Paul Jennings, \"A Slave in The White House\"- the book that first speaks of a black man in the oval office, only he was dusting it, pouring drinks for President Madfison and he was, in truth, the one who rescued the lifesized portrait of George Washington. (Dolley Madison was a selfish, nasty woman who became frighened of her 104 slaves after President Madison died; oit is a fact, that during her lifetime at Montpieler after James died, Nat Turner's revolt occured and in New England the ship \"Amistad\" was overturned. For so many of us, fiction is a way to step into the minds and souls of another person in another world. With \"Gone With The Wind\" you run the risk of emerging a bigot.",
            "This is not a review or comment on Margaret Mitchell's work, but on the cheap, shoddy way that Scribner decided to package it. My daughter is in her third reading since we purchased this volume as a Christmas present in December, 06, and is the only one reading it in the house. Chunks of pages have begun falling out of the binding. The spine is paper, and not sturdy at that.I'm no expert on bookbinding, but this casts an image (for me, at least) of cheapness over the publisher. I'd like to have thought that for the price, this could have been expected to last a bit longer than 4 months.I guess this one's not going to be an heirloom. I've had many, many paperbacks that are in better condition after similar use.Sad, really, for such a wonderful work, to have been packaged this way.",
            "This is a great love story with more than a smidgen of insight into the human psyche, but it is also an offensive apologia for the American Original Sin--slavery. This is our Wagner. If you read it in public, don't forget the brown paper bag.",
            "I really liked this book. I'm a very very fast reader, and I read it in about one and a half hours. I really liked this book. It is a very nice story about the Civil War from a southerners point of view. You don't see very many books like that. I especially liked the part where they have to work in the fields. It shows that the Confederates didn't like the treatment of slaves, but they didn't care about the slaves. I kind of liked this book.",
            "I only knew the story from the movie, so I bought this book the week before we invaded Iraq, I'm sure at some subconscious level to read a viewpoint about war. The first half of the book was ok, I liked the descriptions of the suffocating constraints of upper class society at the time and Scarlett's rejection of them. The devastation of war and the struggle that Scarlett and her family went through were powerful. However, the second half of the book completely turned me off to the story. Margret Mitchell's descriptions of the reconstruction were so vile I almost put the book down. Blacks were only happy being slaves, they were too stupid for anything else. The only good blacks in the book are the ones who can serve the whites. Big Sam says he had enough of freedom and wants to go back to Tara. He's even incredulous that while in the north whites wanted him to sit at the dinner table with them like he was their equal, but he couldn't do it because he is not the equal to whites. Mitchell actually says that he smiles and feels better when Scarlett starts to tell him what to do because someone is telling him what to do again. Mitchell also uses animal metaphors when describing the black characters.At one point Mitchell is describing how the southern whites hate the Yankees so much because the Yankees have money and food and power and they do not, yet she doesn't have any sense of irony to see that the whites are in the position that they put the slaves in for centuries.And another thing that I did not like about the book is that most of the characters are serious sociopaths. They kill anyone who breaks their rules of racial propriety. Rhett kills a black man for being \"upity\" to a white woman, another character, one of the Fontaine boys, kills a black man for for saying something to a white woman. We are not told what but it is pretty obvious it was sexual, so we have the sterotype of the black male sexual prowler. Then the same Fontaine boy kills Jonas Wilkinson for telling black men that they are equal to whites and that they are alowed to have white women!! He doesn't just kill him, he cuts him to ribbons with a knife. There are many more examples of this psychotic behaviour. And Mitchell treats these behaviors as if they are to be admired. While reading I kept thinking these people are all nuts. I was glad they suffered and I'm glad they lost the war. I lost any sense of caring about what happened to any of them, including Scarlett.Also, this is a very anti-American book. Mitchell keeps going on about how awful the Yankees and the Union and the federal government are and how great Georgia and states rights are. Of course, states rights here means being able to murder anyone who annoys you. The reconstruction section of the book should be read by everyone just to show why the flying of the Confederate flag is so offensive. It is completely un-American.And one last thing. This isn't a great love story. Rhett is really only a supporting character in the book until the last 200 pages when they get married, and for a book over 1000 pages, that's not alot. I think people remember the movie more than the actual book.I was really dissapointed with this book. I was looking forward to enjoying a nice read and discovered that it was horrible propaganda. It is really hard to believe that this book won the Pulitzer prize over Absalom,Absalom! by Faulkner.",
            "Gone With the Wind was written by Margaret Mitchell and was published in 1936. This book is mainly about the difficult times for Scarlett O'Hara. The book was focused around the era of the Civil War. Gone With the Wind is a romance story about Scarlett O'Hara,her love of her homeland, Tara, and her search for love. She was jealous of Melanie Wilkes who married her cousin, Ashley, whom Scarlett desired. In the rage of Ashley marrying Melanie, Scarlett marries the first man who asks her, Melanie's brother Charles. Within 2 months Charles dies in the Civil War leaving her with a baby. She desperately tries to win over Ashley by moving in with Melanie and Melanie's aunt after Charles died. When Scarlett becomes bored with her living conditions, she goes to a fundraiser and meets Rhett Butler, a wealthy man from Georgia and he falls in love with her. But Rhett is very annoyed with the fact that Scarlett is in love with Ashley. Then tragedies start when the Civil War comes close to Georgia and Atlanta. Melanie gets pregnant and Ashley goes to war because Atlanta is attacked. Scarlett would have to escape back home to Tara before the Yankees come. Scarlett, along with her son Wade, her servant Prissy, Melanie, and Melanie's son Beau travel to the plantation Tara, where Scarlett was born, and Scarlett finds no food, no animals, only 2 remaining servants, a dead mother, an insane father, and 2 sick sisters. In desperation to survive, Scarlett marries Rhet Butler, and has a baby girl named Ella. She realizes too late that Rhett is her true love, but Rhett is tired of being second to Ashley, and leaves Scarlett. She decides she wants to get Rhett back, and then says \"I won't think about that today, I'll think about that tomorrow. After all, tomorrow is another day.\" I enjoyed the book a lot, and would recommend it to anyone who has a lot of time, and likes to read love stories. It was long, but the author, Margaret Mitchell told the story of the civil war very detailed and colorful, and had a way with her words to make ever page enjoyable, and memorable.",
            "Gone With the Wind is a classic novel of love and loss. Taking place in a time and place which is, quite literally, &quot;gone with the wind,&quot; it is interesting in both a historical sense and a romantic one. This novel is often called &quot;the greatest love story of all time,&quot; and truthfully at that. There is nothing quite as stirring as the interactions between Rhett and Scarlett. Margaret Mitchell's classic writing and understanding of times gone by makes this one of my (and the world's) ultimate favorites. At this point, this novel has reached so much fame that it is hardly necessary to discuss the plot, but for those uninformed out there, here it is:Scarlett O'Hara is the beautiful and headstrong eldest daughter of rich, high class plantation owners living just south of Atlanta during the antebellum period. Scarlett is the belle of the county - she has the smallest waist, the prettiest face, and the flirtiest personality. She could have any man, except the one she wants - Ashley Wilkes, who is already engaged to the frail but very sweet Melanie. When the Civil War breaks out everything changes. Scarlett marries, but is immediatly made a widow, and she moves to Atlanta to stay with Melanie. All the while Rhett Butler is lurking around. He's handsome, suave, and has a horrible reputation - hardly the kind of gentleman Scarlett was raised to like. But Scarlett, with her stubborn, headstrong attitude, brains, and independence is hardly a typical southern lady. As the war rages on, Scarlett's world is shattered and challenged. Wealth turns to poverty, pride to despair, admiration to dislike, and hate to love.Once started, this is a novel that cannot be put down. Many people read the whole thing (over 1,000 pages) in one very long sitting! That's what I did.",
            "I may just may be a 12-year-old girl, but when I read this book, I fell completely in love with it. I have the movie, an anthology and a paperback version that needs to be replaced after I find a hardcover version in stores. In a way it was better than the movie. It gave you a different idea about what Scarlett O'Hara was like and what she went through. It was and is just an excelent example of American history.",
            "I recieved Gone With the Wind as a Christmas gift and was not very excited about it. I had seen the movie and did not care for it, so I thought the book would problably be even worse--dragging on and on. I was so wrong. While not a quick read by any means, Gone With the Wind is completely fasinating. Everything about this book is perfect, from the characters to the events of the Civil War. Every character, especially the main characters, but even the minor characters, were wonderfully developed and real. I fell in love with each one. Scarlett and Rhett were written so honestly that, even in their wicked times, I could not help but love them. Melanie and Ashely as well were beautifully crafted. The story line is full of intimate, captivating details. Every scene is vital to the feel of the story and the final outcome. It has been several weeks since I finshed Gone With the Wind and I still find myself thinking about it and reliving it in my mind. There is a warning, however: When reading this book, do not read it from the the perspective of a person living in the 21st century. You must remember that our values have changed and, while definately for the better, the culture of Gone With the Wind should be judged on the basis of their own culture and morality, not our own. With that in mind, settle down for one of the most beautifully written and imaginatively creative books of our time.",
            "This book is just amazing. It is mind blowing. I loved it, I never wanted it to end. When I finally pulled myself away to eat or something I was dazed. I felt as though I were wearing glorious, beautiful dresses and corsets. The ending left me heartbroken. As fantastic and brilliant as this novel is, I both loved and hated the ending. It wasn't right as Scarlett and Rhett were made for eachother. So I read the sequal and although it could never match Maragret Mitchell, I was delighted to see Rhett and Scarlett together. It was though it had finally ended as I was far to curious and left hanging to leave it at the ending in Gone With The Wind. It is truly a masterpiece and I wish that Margaret had written the sequal, not alexandra and Margaret Mitchell was the only one who could really make the characters come alive as she did. I am only 15 but this novel makes the gentle, romantic days on the old South so appealing that I wish I knew what it was like to be there! For those who didn't like the sequal I find it hard to think that you didn't like the ending. It was just so hard to leave it with Rhett and Scarlett apart - him not loving her. Read Gone With the Wind than read the sequal Scarlett. Although Scarlett isn't great, it leaves you feeling pleased that they are together!",
            "I've read this book over and over again, and every time I finish I'm convinced that I'm never going to get tired of it. The story, although goes on forever (which think is okay, since I like to read, but many people I know complain abouth the lenght of the book) is so engrossing, so minutely descriptive and fascinating, even people who don't care for this kind of work will have at least to recognize the painstaking job of researching and piecing together the facts about American Southern life in the years of the Civil War. And the characters are something else. My absolute favorite literary heroine is Scarlett O'Hara, even if she was so stupid sometimes she made me desperate, and Rhett... well, sometimes I almost felt sorry for him, for all his macho-man behavior. Almost. You can't really feel sorry for a guy like this. And I loved the ending too, it was just right for the story. Anyway, I highly recommend this book to anyone, it deserves its reputation as a great classic, and by the way, so does the movie, even if it's not quite like the book, but that's to be expected, I guess.",
            "I have read Gone with the Wind in Chinese two times. I think that it is one of the best novels in the world. I was not only enjoying the beautiful language, but also learned the Civil War history. Magaret's characters showed me vivid and alive image. Especially Scarlett O'hara. Maybe, at the beginning of the book is not very interesting. But please continue you will find that you can not give it up. I love to talk about my feelings each time when I read it now. The first time I read it was in 1984. That time, I was a high school student, and reading famous novels was a popular thing to do. When my classmate and I met after summer vacation, they often asked me if I had read something interesting. I picked up Gone with the Wind. It is a huge novel, and there are too many foreigners. I couldn't remember all of the characters names. I couldn't figure out what happened. The only thing I could tell was that Scarlett was a very young girl and she loved to get the boys' attention. I just read one third of it because I was not interested in the love story. The second time that I read it was in 1991. I worked in a bank. My job was to count money. It was so boring when we had no money to count. So, I picked up the novel again. This time I could not give it up. Scarlett absorbed me. She was a spoiled, ruthless girl. She did everything she wanted to do and never thought about the consequences. I could see this from her first marriage. She didn't know if she really loved her husband. She already became Charles' widow and a boy's mother. During the civil war, Scarlett grew up. She had a very strong head. She was a brave lady. She saved her home from Sherman and the carpetbaggers. I think Scarlett was still too young to understand true love. Captain Butler said, &quot;I loved you but I couldn't let you know it. You're so brutal to those who love you, Scarlet. You take their love and hold it over their heads like a whip.&quot; When she recognized that she loved him so much too, it was already too late. Butler didn't trust her any more and didn't want to save his love with her. He left home. I cried for Scarlett. It was painful because their love story does not have a good end. But just because this end, Magaret moved thousands and thousands reader's hearts. I felt sadder than Scarlett did. I wouldn't know how to live without Butler's love. &quot;I'll think of it all tomorrow. After all, tomorrow is another day.&quot; Said Scarlett. That was Scarlett's way. I have learned a lot from her. I become brave and have a strong head after I read it. I can say Gone with the Wind is one of the best novels. It helps me have an excellent marriage. I think that young girls should read it and to learn be a brave and independent person. Finding true love and treating it as treasure is the effective method to have happy marriage.",
            "Scarlett is a complex woman...full of so many emotions that there is some of all of us in her. This book sets the plight of the Old South in an interesting fictional story...educating you without the feel of a textbook. You understand why the South tried like mad to hold onto its clearly outdated values and traditions. The struggle of the South becomes Scarlett's struggle with herself and the changing world around her. Then when you add Rhett Butler into the mix, off go the fireworks! This is truly a book that you have to read to appreciate. I don't enjoy romance novels or fiction that is too fluffy and this book has sometimes had those reputations. Not so...this book will grab you and never let you go.",
            "My mother is a huge fan of Gone With The Wind and for years she tried to get me to read it but I wouldn't because it's not the kind of thing I usually read. However, I finally read it when I was about 15 and I couldn't believe what I had been missing out on! Since then I have read it about a million times! The thing that makes Gone With the Wind so much better than your average romance is the wonderfully realistic characters. Considering she is the heroine Scarlett is not the nicest person in the world but that is what makes her so likeable! The same applies to Rhett Butler, who you can't help falling in love with even though he's not real! The book is sad, exciting and informative all at once and I can honestly say it is the best book I have ever read!!! The sequel &quot;Scarlett&quot; is almost as good in my opinion, though once you have read it, the ending to Gone With The Wind is spoiled. Anyway, if you haven't read either of these books yet, I recommend you read them now or you'll regret it like I did!",
            "I started to read this book as a challenge - to see if I could actually finish it. I did, finally, (after about a month) and was really impressed. Actually, I was quite sad at the end of the last paragraph. It was definetly a classic book, but I don't intend on reading it again anytime in the near future.Scarlett O'Hara is a great character. Though bull-headed, nasty, and insensitive, she comes off as a believeable southern woman post-Civil War. She apparantly has no feelings whatsoever for those who care for her most, that is, she doesn't find out how much people mean to her until the very last chapter of the book. Still, she is strong, stubborn, can be sweet, and can get whatever she wants. And yes, she is a believeable character. I simply can not stand people who use the excuse that the character was unbelieveable. How is that? By saying that, you're saying that there could'nt be anyone in the world with the same qualities as that person? I don't think so.The only thing that bothered me about this was the fact that Scarlett didn't give a rat's a** about her children. Much to the point where they were afraid of her. That fact just might make some people hate her.But, all other matters aside, I don't think I can express enough how much I loved this book. It was beautifully written, with the right word choice (they would talk in big words all the time, so I was thankful that I could actually understand them!) and such. I know some people hated this book, but that's their opinion. I don't know why there is even such a thing as reviews. You just have to read the book for yourself and don't trust what anyone else says. And don't spend all your time going into such detail about the plot. That thing with Rhett's mentioned but not explained son really has no relevance to the plot. If you spend all your time looking at the downsides of the story, you'll never enjoy it. But, I do hope that you enjoy this book, because I think it it really great.",
            "GWTW was the very best. I always thought that there was no way that a book could really touch me, emotionally I mean. This was the only book that could accomplish that. Magaret Mitchell did a superb job writing this book, and I think that there never should have been a sequel written, for no continuation of the story could match the excellency of GWTW. I felt that the book ended well, and that if it had ended as a 'happily ever after' sort of thing, it wouldn't have been believable at all. Although I was crying at the end, I do believe it turned out correctly. I could not put it down! GWTW is timeless, and applies to everyone, so I recommend this book to every single person out there. Everyone can relate to the charecters in this book. A true classic, you've gotta read Gone With the Wind. I doubt I will ever find a book that can compare with the quality of it! Read it. PLEASE! We can all learn a lesson from the charecters in the book, especially Scarlett O'hara. A must read!",
            "I was 13 when I first read Gone with the Wind. It was a Chinese version. I couldn't remember who translated the book. All I could remember was that it was one of the most touching story I've ever read. I was encouraged by the Scarlett's passion and courage for life and touched by Rhett's patience and love.A few days ago, I picked up an English version of Gone of the Wind. It seems so much better than before. Maybe it's because that I'm now older and I can understand people's feelings in another dimension. Or maybe it's becuase I've moved to America and I had a better understanding of the western culture. I cried after reading it. I wish there was a different ending!",
            "What can I say about GWTW that hasn't already been said? The story is so captivating, and you can envision every scene because Margaret Mitchell describes every detail with such beautiful language. You really feel drawn back in time to the Old South and the Civil War. However, the characters are what really make the story so compelling, and the way they interact with each other is quite interesting because they are all so different. Scarlett O'Hara is probably one of the best literary characters ever created. She is very spoiled and self-centered, but I can't help but admire her strength and courage. There's also Rhett Butler, the handsome yet terribly scandalous man who loves Scarlett. Their relationship is definitely one of the greatest love stories ever written. You just have to read it! Don't be intimidated by the fact that it is over 1000 pages, the language is wonderful but not that complicated. If you haven't read this book, you're really missing out on a fantastic reading experience. Read it, and you will see why nearly seventy years after its initial publication, Gone With the Wind has not been forgotten.",
            "Just what the world needs. One more review of \"Gone With the Wind.\" I approached reading this book with a sense of trepidation. I looked at its 1,000+-page length, and doubted it was worth my time. I was afraid that it would be nothing more than an overblown historical romance novel. \"I'll think about it tomorrow\" summarizes the artistic merit of the book, I thought. Without the famous movie to sustain its reputation, who in their right mind would bother reading the book? Well, I was wrong. Looking beyond the soap opera of Scarlett, Rhett, and Ashley, I found things that really make this novel worthwhile. It's a richly detailed and historically accurate story of the Civil War and Reconstruction period, seen by those who bore the deprivations of daily life, not to mention the loss of loved ones. Although formatted as fiction, here we have living history. Margaret Mitchell draws deeply on her Georgia roots and gives the reader a uniquely Southern perspective of State Rights, slavery, Yankees, Carpetbaggers, Lincoln Republicans, and even the infamous Ku Klux Klan. Through the tribulations of Scarlett O'Hara, Mitchell argues that the Southern Cause appeared noble, but was ultimately foolish and futile. Above all, both Scarlett and Rhett Butler are practical people who doubt the sagacity of stifling social mores, and blind political affiliation. One can view Scarlett as the image of the South as she matures from a frivolous girl full of romantic notions into a strong, independent woman. Her pragmatism and steely resolve, forged on an anvil of personal suffering and survival, is another theme of the novel. It's easy to find the romantic melodrama of the surface plot distracting because it is fine entertainment. To enhance your reading pleasure, however, notice the rich historical detail and heed Scarlett's determination. As God is my witness, this is good reading. ;-)",
            "Going into this book, I was skeptical that I would enjoy it, as I am more into the Fantasy/Medievil genre. However, I don't know how anyone could not love this book. The characters are so real, the scenes so vividly described, and the feelings so profound that even I, someone not into the genre, couldn't get enough of it! Even though Scarlett was hostile towards loving Melanie, you couldn't help loving her! And I can actually see from the point of view of the Confederacy during the Civil War. It almost seems like their actions are justifiable, and we never learn this way of thinking in school! Over all, I have to say that Gone With the Wind lives up to it's reputation as one of the best novels of the 20th century!",
            "I first read this novel set during the Civil War when I was 12 years old. Shortly after that I was able to see the film version in an old downtown theater during one of its periodic rereleases. I was enthralled by both the novel and film. Is there anyone out there who doesn't know the plot? For the 10 people in the world who don't know, it features Scarlet O'Hara, a Southern belle, living that role to the hilt on her family's Southern, slave-worked plantation, when all hell breaks loose with the Civil War. Admirable for her survivor qualities, Scarlet is also manipulative and ruthless but meets her match in Rhett Butler, a Southerner who manages to move profitably among both sides of the War while most of the South is starving. I reread this novel as an adult, expecting that with my many more years of reading since that first read, that I would find the book over the top and soap opera like. It didn't happen. I couldn't put it down and had every bit as fascinating a time reading it again as I did the first time. If you haven't given it a reread in many a year, try it yourself and you'll be very pleasantly surprised.",
            "I have been reading &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; every couple of years since I was first &quot;allowed&quot; to read it at the age of 14! (In those days our mothers had higher hurdles for &quot;appropriate&quot; reading). When I was younger, I read this book once every year. I actually learned to read French without a dictionary by reading the French translation. (It's long enough to have that kind of linguistic influence! )The story of Scarlett O'Hara, a feisty and courageous southern &quot;belle&quot; whose beauty and sharpness was complicated by a lack of insight into human nature that ultimately left her unable to understand the hearts of those she most loved and by whom she was loved, until it was too late. It is also the story of the the South just before, during and after the Civil War.A more sympathetic portrait of the South than many other Civil war histories, it has aged fairly well, despite a slightly more patronistic view of African-Americans than one might be comfortable with today. Given its authorship dating back to the 1930s, I believe one needs to look at the book in the context of its historical period, and not to demean its historical or entertainment value simply because we are more aware and more sophisticated after the Era of Civil Rights in the United States. I also believe a sympathetic and well-educated person such as the author Margaret Mitchell seems to be, would have been the first to agree had she lived long enough to undergo that period of transformation in our country.Despite this limitation, few books of historical fiction are so well-plotted, and few characters in literature are so well-developed as that of Scarlett O'Hara, Rhett Butler, or Ashley and Melanie Wilkes--people I continue to feel like I &quot;knew&quot; in another time.The story is also that of Atlanta, a city which was relatively young and &quot;brash&quot; as a Confederate economic and cultural center, relative to Charleston and Richmond, the more sedate Confederate capitals.The book is valuable both as a historical text for those of us with little insight into the viewpoint of the South beyond that given in grade school textbooks, and as one of the most romantic dramas in American literature.I enjoyed reading this book as much at the age of 48 as I did almost 35 years ago (and many times in-between). I can't imagine a better summer read for a teenage girl, or a better way to relax at the beach for her mother, or a better way to pass a cold snowy vacation in front of a fire. Definetely a book for the romantically inclined.One should also note, that &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is one of the few books (until perhaps &quot;Cider House Rules&quot;) portrayed almost as well on film as the book is written. However the pleasures remain different and self-contained, and no enjoyment of either is lost by viewing or reading the other.",
            "This book is the best thing I've ever read in my life! The details are fantastic and the characters are well portrayed. The storyline is classic! This book immediately sucks you into the story and makes you really care about the characters in it. It made me laugh, it made me angry, it made me cry, and most of all it made my heart melt. I think this is the finest book ever written.",
            "Within the one thousand and twenty-four pages of this book, a reader is allowed to experience hardships, heartbreaks, shocking revalations, and most of all, an overwhelming emotionally-charged, intense book. This is one great book! Characters come alive, colors form before the eye of your imagination, shapes and sounds seem to ring in your ears, and undeniable passion sets fire to your heart. If you haven't read this experience of a lifetime, you are missing out on one of America's most treasured, true, and honest classics. (Those nights you will spend reading late into the hour and the tiredness of the next day are definatly worth it:)",
            "Reading Gone With The Wind is indeed an experience. It is able to change the opinion on romance stories for someone who does not like to read romance, it made me unable to put down the book even though I was busy.The story basically tells how the beautiful Southern belle Scarlett O Hara hardened during the American Civil War and her ruthless ways of making money even it means to marry someone whom she did not love as well as engaging the convicts to run the mills. The story also talks about the unusual love between Scarlett and Rhett Butler whom Scarlett hated intially and also the patriotism of the American Southerners. One could feel the different emotions of Human when reading the story such as jealousy, anger, honour between people and the country, love and so on. It is one unforgettable reading experience and Margaret Mitchell is indeed a talented writer whom I should say that it was regrettable that she was not the one who was writing the sequel to this story. Gone With The Wind is a highly recommended story.",
            "When I look back on my sophomore year of high school, I will remember it as the year I read Gone With the Wind, and became hooked. I have thought about it everyday since I started it. I adore this story. The descriptions in this book will take your breath away. Once when she was back at Tara, in the dead of winter, I looked up and was shocked that the sun was shining, and there was food downstairs in the refrigerator. It will literally sweep you in. I read it in September, in a little less than a week. I didn't read it as a challenge or anything. It was actually a &quot;rebelling&quot; act. My mom hates the story line because she doesn't like how Southerners &quot;won't let the war die.&quot; Her saying how much she hated it totally backfired because it only made me want to read it more so I could see what was so bad about it. Then I fell in love with it. When I re-read some of the dialogue, especially that at the end of the book, between Scarlett and Rhett, my heart positively aches. The language is so beautiful. I cried for an hour after I finished it. The ending is absolutely tragic, but there's no other way it could've ended and been as good. I don't understand how anyone can not like it. The Southern backdrop during the Civil War was a necessity to the essence of the story. I know slavery was one of America's greatest atrocities, but that's not what this book is about. It is the story of a woman trying to save herself and her home, and in the process, ruining the love of one of the most dashing, white knights of all fiction because of her only-human downfalls-greed, fear and lust.I loved Scarlett's character. She was exactly as Rhett described-a brave, frightened, insensitive, bull-headed child. She did try to be good, and then something would happen to scare her, so she'd get mean again. I loved Melanie, too. I want to be a friend like she was. She was good, but not goody-goody. She loved people fiercely, as Scarlett wanted things fiercely. She stood by her beloved friend to the bitter end, even though she knew Scarlett had betrayed her. Rhett was such an absolutely wonderful person. He only couldn't show it to the everyday Scarlett-hardened and greedy-because she would think him weak. He was only tender and loving when she was in fear. I want to meet someone like him-I just hope I don't act like Scarlett! The characters were so human, I loved them all. Everyone should read this book. It is such a beautifully-written masterpiece. It's my favorite.",
            "I first read GONE WITH THE WIND many years ago. I read it again every few years. Why not? In spite of the long list of criticisms (melodramatic, insensitive, sexist, racist, materialism, soap opera, etc.) it is undeniably magnificent. Writers, this is a great book to read backwards---last chapter, then forward, chapter by chapter. You will learn a lot about writing if you do this.",
            "This novel is, I'm certain you must know by now, a family saga covering the Civil War and Reconstruction in the South from the viewpoint of a wealthy Southern family who live on a plantation called 'Tara.'Easy to read, 'Gone With the Wind' is not only a family saga, but a fascinating character study of people who did what they had to do in order to survive the devastating war years and the reconstruction that followed. Lives and lifestyles were changed forever with the Civil War. Southerners had to adapt to an entirely foreign way of life and this novel explores how different people coped in the form of well-developed, complex characters.Difficult to put down, this novel is one you will read over and over again and eventually pass down to your children. Don't hesitate to buy a copy!",
            "This book probably has more reviews written for it than any other that I've seen on the Amazon site. As I said, I don't know what I can add that others haven't already said...but I have often thought, as I have read and re-read this wonderful novel, that I don't think Scarlett would get Rhett back in the end. I always thought Rhett was far more intelligent, well-rounded, and wise than she, and that an awful lot of his longing for her was comprised of her lack of availability (her heart, that is, that heart that belonged only to Ashley), and her looks. After all, when did he fall for her? When he looked up at her on the staircase and she was wearing that low-cut green-sprigged dress!The fascinating characters that Mitchell so deftly brings to life are what make this novel so unforgettable. I don't know that any of them are truly believable, but somehow that doesn't matter. The writing style is dated (all those exclamation points!), and of course the dialect and political viewpoints are atrocious in this day and age. The amazing thing is that none of this matters as we find ourselves caught up in Scarlett's world, a world, as Mitchell so poignantly writes,that was gone with the wind.When Rhett tells Scarlett at the end, \"I won't be pursued as the luckless Ashley was pursued,\" I believe he meant it. The fact that he could coin a phrase like, \"Someone or something has convinced you that your lover is too large a piece of Dead Sea fruit for even you to chew\" (not sure if I'm quoting this 100% correctly, but I've memorized large portions of the dialogue through re-reading) simply showcases how much more extensive his intellect is than Scarlett's. He realizes now that she no longer holds any appeal for him; her charm for him, simply, was her unattainable-ness. (not a word, either - sorry!)I never read the sequel. To me, that would be a sacrilege. Mitchell always said that for her, the novel ended when it ended. But no one who reads it can resist pondering...\"Did she get him back?\" And I say no.But read it anyway. It's a long read, but oh, such an enjoyable one.",
            "This book is now my favorite book of all time (it contends with the Bible people!) and is the reason I am grateful to have sight and the ability to read, to enjoy masterpieces like this. I will admit the first 100 pages were slightly slow, but necessary to build the story. I loved learning more about the Civil War and appreciated seeing it from a perspective that often gets shrouded in history. Slavery was never ok but this book allowed me to explore slavery from the South's point of view. I also loved Scarlet, even with all her downfalls, and enjoyed the book most all when Rhett was highlighted.Every American should be required to read this book! That is how passionately I loved it.Also, the un-sequel Scarlet was a lovely read. Some contest that Mitchell's work should have been left alone and I can see their point. However, I wasn't ready to say good-bye to Scarlet just yet. No, the sequel does not quite compare to the original, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend the sequel to those who secretly want a happier ending for Scarlet.",
            "GWTW-I discovered it on the shelf of my highschool library & having never heard of it, I decided I would read it. I was completely unprepared for the ride! While we all want to be Melanie, the truth is-we're all a little Scarlett on the inside! I have since read the book many times (and of course own the DVD) and never tire of it. A definite book for gals-you get a glimpse into southern life at the time of the Civil War and experience a love story of enormous preportions. \"Fiddle Dee Dee\" is our catch phrase around the house! LOVED IT>",
            "Do yourself a favor and order Gone with the Wind now. Just make sure you have a lot of time to devote to this book, because once you start reading it, you won't be able to stop. Margaret Mitchell's classic is a fantastic, almost hypnotizing read and Scarlett O'Hara is one of the best --if not the best-- characters in American fiction of all time.",
            "well, english is not my mother tongue but I speak it well enough to love this book. Maybe I'm not completely objective since I have seen the movie for about 10 time before I had read the book (this means I'm crazy about the movie) but still some things are slightely different then they are portrayed in the movie. First of all, there are a lot of characters that the film does not mention (which are quite important, but still, does not change the point) and the book is a lot more unfair I might say, to the slaves (only after reading I realized why there are, if any, contoversies surrounding GWTW phenomenon). They are often portrayed as silly, not so bright people (although very, very lovely and loving) and in the movie they are very smart, prudent people that often help when white people couldn't, that often show more courage and intelligence then the wihite people do and that's why I like them better portrayed in the film. But the things why I absolutely love GWTW, love between Rhett and Scarlett and deep friendship between Scarlett and Melanie, stay the same. So, all in all, I truly recommend this book first of all, to all the GWTW fans (because they CAN'T go wrong with reading it) and then to all the others who'd like to find out thing or two about how things were back in the old South, meet really great characters that are above all, believable and convincing and read about the greatest love story of our time, as it's been said on the covers.",
            "I loved this book but the end reduced me to tears. And Rhett ,Rhetts character made me love him literally love him like Scarlett did lin the end. When I was reading this book I felt like I was Scarlett and when he said he did not love her I felt like he was saying that to me . I'm sad that Margaret Mitchell died before she could make the sequel because I fell in love with Rhett ! My heart is empty right now . Oh Rhett ! By: Heart Broken",
            "Amazing peice of work, and should be read by everyone. This is the best written novel I have ever read, and probably will be the ebst written novel I will ever read in my lifespan. This book has so much detail, the way the characters are described are almost impossible to compare to any book written. Not only is this an epic, but I find it to be a historical epic; it navigates through the years, when the civil war started (or months before it began), through the civil war, the end and the reconstruction. The reconstruction is something that is not ever really written about, and the novel actually depicts what the south is going through after the civil war.Some people might find Scarlett, to be selfish and well...a bitch. But I loved her! Wither her the entire story wouldn't work! I found her love over ashley to be rather mezmerizing, who would spend years after someone, and into three marriages?Scarlett! I thought the most detailed part, were the settings especially rhett's and Scarlett's dream home, talk about having a nice mansion!",
            "Gone with the Wind is an epic tale of a Southern belle, living through the time that was the Civil War. Scarlett O'Hara, a beautiful yet harsh young woman, is the female protaganist, and the story follows her journey, beginning in a time when all is well; the balls, the parties, the beaux. Her vindictive and manipulative nature pushes her to make a mistake or two, and she finds herself widowed soon after the war has started. The novel leads the audience through the abundance of obstacles Scarlett must endure, allowing the reader to sympathise with her during the lost love of Ashley Wilkes, the neglected love of Rhett Butler, and the terrible times she experiences throughout the war.Margaret Mitchell, despite the fact that Gone with the Wind is her first and only novel, narrates the story with an ease in both the plot and the dialogue, throwing the audience head first into a world where the negroes work for the white man, where war has broken out, and where it is innappropriate to wear a dress revealling your bosom in the morning.Compared to other anecdotes narrating stories of the Civil War, Gone with the Wind is not only a tear-jerker, but a tale that captures hearts, and fingers; leaving readers unable to put the book down.",
            "Hey Everyone! I absolutely LOVE this book. Everybody thought that I was crazy because I am 11 years old and I read a book with over 1,000 pages. But the book turned out to be wonderful! I would recommend it to everybody. The tale of Scarlett O'Hara stole my heart. Margaret Mitchell is a wonderful author and a great story teller. Everybody has to read this stupendous novel at least one time in their life!",
            "I never thought a book good be so beautiful, so wonderful, good enough to eat. I saw the movie in 3rd grade and fell in love with it. I decided to go to my school library and pick up a copy of the book. I started reading and even the librarian couldnt believe that such a young child, with such an adult book.My teacher, and class mates, IMPRESSED! For me, I never wanted to stop. From Twelve Oaks to Tara, the thrill never ends. So I finished it with partly understanding but then re-read it in sixth grade. The words that were chosen to make this book, is truly amazing. I have to hand it to your Margaret Mitchell, for creating the best book that America will ever know. Because with all of the books I have read and with all of the books I am going to read, I know there is nothing like, \"Gone with The Wind.\" \"Frankly My dear...there is nothing like it!\" So I am suggesting you start reading it soon, because if you dont have time to day, dont worry . . . \"Because tomorrow is another day,\"",
            "The many adventures of a spoiled, vain, and annoying adolescent living in Georgia during the Civil War era. I read this book at least once yearly just for the mental time travel. Boy, could Margaret Mitchell paint a picture! I always feel as though I'm right on Peachtree Street with Scarlett O'Hara, and I never fail to get mad at her for losing Rhett. Everyone should try this at least once.",
            "Scarlett O' Hara has to be the most famous character ever written in all of literature. Her story about coming to age just when the Civil War began and having to learn everything she was taught is of no use to her during war and after war is a must read for anyone. Her transformation into a shrewd, lying and spoiled southern belle is just about the best for any reader who loves stories based on the southern way of life. I just have to say this book is not racist and it was never intended to be. Many people just think it is because now we are bombarded into thinking blacks are the victims of society due to them having been slaves. People this is the story of Scarlett O'Hara living in times when not many black people were educated. Some blacks were but many were not as the belief back then was that blacks were just not too smart to learn. Which we now know is not true. But one thing is true and what many of us now have to understand is that many blacks who were slaves did not want to be freed. Where were they going to go and what were they going to do after being free? What did they know about this strange land being freed? How were they going to survive? They didn't know and they didn't know anything about taking the intiative of oneself instead of being told what to do. And many blacks were defending the then southern way of living. Many slaves did love there slaveowners and wanted to remain with them. Many slaves did fight on the Confederate side willingly. Even when the south did lose the war many ex-slaves did stay with they're ex-slave owners because in they're way of thinking they still belonged to them. It was a mutual love. They did die fighting believing in the Confederate way of thinking. They were not brainwashed it was just they way of living that they knew. They loved there white folk like many Mammies did love there white kids as if they were they're own children. We have to remember that the way of thinking was completely different back then. We have to remember if that way of thinking was now we would think the same way. Love knows no barriers. The love of another to another is just that. Even if it meant a slave-owner loving his slave like a slave loved his owner. Didn't God have a commandment to treat your slave with respect and to give him his seventh year free. The bad people of this story were the carpetbaggers. They caused so much damage in this country back then that the states suffered it for years because of them. They lied to the ex-slaves by telling them to vote them into office and then wanting to have nothing to do with them. As Margaret Mitchell tells in the book many blacks were put into also. I read many books about this subject and it is true. The most ignorant and hateful towards white were put into office. They saw this as a way to get back at the whites for having them in slavery. But that is not it. Many slaves saw it as revenge because of the wrong done unto them by being slaves. What the carpetbaggers did was poison the minds of the ex-slaves by telling them it was wrong and it was wrong but they made them hate the whites by telling lies about how many whites ex-slaveowners beat, torture, and rape and commit atrocities against the blacks. Okay yes it did happen. But like many stories it was embellished. Only about a one percent of the whites did own plantations. Something we dont't believe but it is true. We have been taught that all whites back then were rich and made they're riches on the backs of blacks. That's not true. If it was then there would be more blacks in this country then there are whites. WE as a people of this time know our TIME only, meaning now or present time. We are a product of the liberal public education system. I mean we don't know our history or any other countries either. We love to embellish the past, everybody now who was of voting age swear up and down that they voted for Kennedy when he was running for the presidency. That is a complete lie. So everybody who now who is black (this is excluding the newly arrived black Africans) swear up and down they came from slaves. That is a lie also. Many black families immigrated into the US after the Civil War and after the nineteen hundreds. So many black people can't say they came from slaves. What I am saying is that the Jessie Jacksons and Al Sharptons of this world have poisoned many black people of this country to the point of wanting to hurt them and keep them enslaved in hatred towards the whites of this country. We should remember the civil war but not be embittered by it.",
            "What is the point of reviewing this book? Everyone knows that it is amazing - the movie won many Oscars and got 5 stars, a rare rating for a movie. I read this 1024 page-turner in about 1 month. It takes a little while to get into the story, but not long. Scarlett's character does get a little frustrating at times, you just want to yell at her so she understands!! But that's what makes this book a definite classic. There shouldn't be anybody in the world without this book on their bookshelves, and I mean anybody. And what is even better is owning an older version, or even a first edition! This book makes you want to know everything about it: the movie, the author, a sequel!! Speaking of that, there is &quot;Scarlett: The Sequel to Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind&quot; by Alexandra Ripley. I would definitely recommend that also, I'm about half way through it. Though the author is different, you get into her style quickly and fall back into the romance of Scarlett and Rhett. I would suggest saving the movie (if you haven't seen it) for after reading the book. A great summer read. Worth the $6!!!",
            "This is without a doubt the best book in the world! I loved the way Margret Mitchell made the charecters so realistic. If you don't read this book you will be missing out on alot. The ending however is heartbreaking. I have read this book a dozen times and it never gets boring. I love the witty remarks of Rhett. This is a book you don't want to miss out on.",
            "It was amazing to me how much I could love a book with so few admirable characters. (One wonders if the film, &quot;The War of the Roses&quot; might not have been contrived from the story of Rhett and Scarlett.) But in all of her rage, Scarlett's stength and determination still makes her an attractive character, and after all of her shenanigans, you still want her to win. When assessing the characters, it is important to remember that they lived in a society where they played by different rules, often rules difficult for us to understand (e.g. rules regarding what constitutes adultery; and unbending rules of loyalty that might otherwise escape many of us). But all in all, beauty seems only to be found in Melanie and Mammy; a pitiful sympathy for Ashley and the other fallen &quot;Old Guard&quot;; and a most certain feeling that, indeed, Scarlett and Rhett, deserved each other, pain and all.",
            "I always thought &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; would forever hold the title.But &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; may surpass it.As a damn yankee,I discovered I belong south of the Mason-Dixon line,where women are treated respectfully,parents are honored,loyalty to family and friends are boundless,and others postive traits exhibited,that are much too scarce today.Read this book and also find yourself wishing to protect and risk your life for Scarlett!",
            "I grew up watching the movie version of Gone With the Wind, and I first read the novel when I was in 9th grade. If you only see the movie, you miss out on so much. This story literally has a little of everything in it. Don't let the length scare you away-it is such an amazing book, don't miss out on it!",
            "This novel is acknowledged as one of, if not the best and most popular novels ever written. It deserves just that because of the universal appeal of its themes. The story starts with Scarlett O'Hara, a charming, determined but stubborn and proud Southern belle, trying to get the heart of Ashley Wilkes, who is to marry all-so-sweet and kind Melly, heartily hated by the leading lady. After over 1000 pages it ends with Scarlett realization that she really loves charming not such a gentleman Rhett Butler, who is also very proud and stubborn.In between the first and the last pages there are 12 years of Scarlett's life, from 16 to 28, Civil War, 3 marriages (the last of them is with Rhett Butler), 3 kids, wealth, poverty, and then wealth again, unseen love of Rhett Butler, death of all beloved, her maturity from a child into a woman, and finally the realization of the true priorities in her life. Unfortunately it is too late, they are all gone with the wind...",
            "First I fell in love with the movie,then I read the book.The edition I have was my moms from the 1930's so i think its an original copy.This story is more than a love story. It is a study in human nature from Scarlets temper tantrums to Rhetts deep devoted love of Scarlet so much so that he has to leave her for his own good.This is undoubtly the best book ever written and by a newcomer at that. Margaret Mitchell outdid herself on this one.",
            "I was twelve years old when I first read this book and fell in love with Scarlett, Rhett, and the Old South. Now, 20 years later, I work in a bookstore and I still recommend this book to customers all the time. When people tell me that they have seen the movie, and therefore don't feel they need to read the book, I always strongly disagree with them. The book is so much better than the movie, and I'm sure I'll be recommending it to people for many years to come.",
            "One of the icons of American Literature and deservedly so.First read this when I was a teenager and my friends and I would ooh and aah over the scene near the beginning where Scarlett was trying to decide what to wear to the party at Ashley's plantation.I read it every couple of years thereafter and as I grew and matured so did my appreciation of this magnificent book. I first became more aware of how detailed Mitchell's research about the Civil War must have been (no matter how biased she was) and this prompted me to read more books both fiction and non-fiction about that period.My next level of maturity was demonstrated by subsequent reads where I became more impressed with Mitchell's willingness to avoid a standard HEA. She never painted Scarlett as anything but what the character demanded: a spoiled debutante whose world had not only collapsed but was blown away forever by the \"wind\". Scarlett's true, unvarnished, bottom line goal in life became to ensure that she and her family would survive and so would that representation of survival - Tara. Compared to the mores of that lost civilization, she seemed to have fallen from grace. In reality, she, being so very young, came to understand which of the values and mores of that civilization were worth keeping and what were just superficial and ignorant societal expectations. Unfortunately, she didn't realize this in time to obtain the greatest of those worthwhile values - true and reciprocated love. However, she did get what she needed and was looking toward the future with her trademark confidence and assurance.Just a fabulous, fabulous book.",
            "I had borrowed the audio from my local library, and after both realizing I wouldn't finish it in time, and that it was so very good I wanted to share it, I bought it. The narration is superb, and adds much to the story. After moving to Atlanta from Wisconsin I am familiar with many of the locations mentioned in the story. I also have begun to understand some of the old family Atlantans' feelings about what happened to their society.",
            "I cried when I finished this book. I honestly did. No, it was not the heart-breaking ending that brought me to tears, but the fact that there was no more Gone with the Wind. The book brought me so much into its depths, made me so much a part of its words, that at the end I felt almost as if a friend died. I just wish that Margaret Mitchell were alive so that I could talk to her, understand the mind that created such a masterpiece. I will never read a better book.",
            "Okay, everyone has been saying that this book is insulting, that it's racist, etc.Yes, it is extremely racist. Slavery is one of the most horrible inventions of the world. When slavery became race-oriented, it got even worse.But everyone really needs to take GWTW in perspective. First of all, the African-American slavery was hugely propagandized by the North U.S. There were a lot less beatings and brandings than is commonly perceived. The real horror of slavery was the psychological effect. Imagine that you've been told all your life that you are worthless, and fit only to be a slave. Wouldn't you conduct yourself in that way? That was the true horror of slavery. The reason that there were few beatings and brandings was even more horrible. It was because slaves were considered to be valuable property, and the plantation owners would as soon whip their valuable horses to death as whip their valuable slaves. The Northerners really didn't need to exaggerate bloodhounds and whippings; these stories are enough to get the North into a patriotic fervor. So GWTW, although ridiculously romanticized when it comes to slavery, is not completely incorrect. But it does fail to take into account the psychological effects that I just mentioned. It also fails the characterize the black characters in the narrative.Despite all these faults, GWTW is not meant to cater to modern views or even what we would call \"just\" views. It is meant to depict the Southern attitude at the time of the Civil War and the Reconstruction. Obviously, since everyone is incredibly incensed about its attitude, it succeeds remarkably well.Second of all, the movie romaticizes the already romantic book. Mitchell did not portray the rich plantationers in GWTW, she portrayed the middle-class, uneducated pioneers, with the exception of the Wilkes family. They were not contemptuous towards Crackers and poor whites because they were only a step and some luck above them. Essentially they had started out in their position. Gerald O'Hara is harldy anyone's estimation of the typical rich, supercilious, high-class planter. There weren't any stereotypical planters in Georgia, anyway, not before or after the Civil War. It was more a homesteading state than a Kentucky.So, overall, GWTW did exactly what it set out to do. And yes, it really neglects the black psychological view and focuses mainly on Scarlett's and Rhett's, with a couple of other characters. But this is also in character of the time. If anyone really wants to read a clarifying book about GWTW, read Southern Daughter. It ought to help with the rather confused opinions being circulated about GWTW.",
            "This has to be the best book ever written. Scarlett, Rhett, Melanie, and Ashley were brought to life within those 1,024 pages. You felt there sorrows, joys, worries, and loves. I loved Rhett, he was such a character! Melanie is larger than life, and too good for Scarlett. As long as she had Ashley, she was unaffected by the war. Ashley was a gentleman in an era he did not belong in. He was simply an ornament not a laborer. Rhett was everything a character could be, (not to mention very dashing.) Scarlett is probably the only character that you love one chapter and hate the next. She had a very strong will to survive and a lot of selfishness. She was strong enough to survive the war, but she was not as strong as Melanie, (mentally.) My very favorite characters were the Tarleton twins, espically Brent. I do think Melanie was not very strong (physically) but she made up for it with her huge heart, you would have to have one to always stand up for Scarlett. My favorite part of the book is when Scarlett and Rhett are on their honeymoon. They were really, truly in love then. I would think Scarlett would love Rhett long before she did. He was so kind and loving to Bonnie. I think Rhett really did love her the whole time, and he really would not leave her. Why didn't Scarlett marry Stuart? The book would be very different, but Scarlett loved him. GREAT BOOK!",
            "Oh my god!!! i just fifnished GWTW like an hour ago and i still keep bursting into tears. is that normal? maybe for other people but not for me. You must read this book- my sister read it when she was 13 and was waiting untill i was 13 for me to read it- i cant even begin to tell you how wonderfull this book is but i will try. it is a historic romance and is set during the Civil War in mainly Atlanta. Scarlett is a southern belle who has everthing done for her. she is shelfish and spoiled but we love her! Its like everything she did to be lady like just made her less lady like. everything that she does that is so hurtful she has a great reason for doing but she cannot see what the long term effect is and she just drives everone away! she loves a man who loves her but cannot marry her so to hurt him she marries a man she dosent love and thats when you get tottaly absorbeb into the BEST BOOK EVER!!! if i start with how great Meli and rhett are ill cry again!

            "I thought it was well written but rather lenghtly. The author has an excellent vocabulary. I'm reading it again. The story came alive for me.",
            "Gone with the Wind is a classic I read during my teenage years yet I had to purchase it in physical form since when I read it I had burrowed it from a library. For all of you who have not read this novel, it is a historical fiction romance novel about a girl who had it all, lost it all and had to learn to stop being so vain. It is a story that will never come out of the line of favorite books to read so one must read it at least one in our lifetime!",
            "This book is unlike any other that I have encountered thus far. It is a dinamic story of a firey young southern girl forced to come to grips with the realities of the war-torn south. Once you start reading you will not be able to put this book down. The details that Mitchell includes are breathtaking and make you feel as if you are back in the days of the old south. The character of Scarlett O'Hara is inspiring. This book is many stories in one; it is a coming-of-age piece, a love story, a war story, and a historical novel. All of these genres come together to create a captivating work of art.",
            "Gone with the wind is one of those storys that wraps you up into the story waiting to find out what is going to happen next to Scarlett. Yet it is the most to deal on real life issues back in the 1860's and post civil war. Even if it is fictional.",
            "A wonderful fascinating historical novel, an intriguing character study, and yes, of course, a tragic love story - this is one of 20th century masterpieces and a must-read for anyone.And this doesn't mean that the characters of the book are perfect or their actions right - instead the imperfections of Scarlett, Rhett and others are what make the story work. Mitchel makes them so that anyone really can identify with them at some point, making the story very realistic and believable. No they are not perfect and their bad traits are not extolled or forgiven, as some reviewers here might think. Indeed, the events in the story reflect this point. (Why do u think Scarlett is left all alone in the end?) If anyone thinks that giving your daughter Gone with the Wind to read would make her think or behave like Scarlett at her worst they are very, very wrong and they just don't get the main idea of the novel.Its so sad, frustrating, bittersweet and great and i love it. I very much recommend this book.",
            "Gone With the Wind, by Margaret Mitchell, is an amazing book based rural Georgia from the Civil War antebellum to Reconstruction. Scarlett O'Hara begins as a sixteen-year-old belle of the county, but ends up facing perils the kind of which she could never imagine. In the book, love holds Scarlett together, but in the end fails her. Mitchell's style is unique and distinguishable. The moral value of this book is unusually displayed by the contradictions to it made by Scarlett. I loved reading about Scarlett's relationships with her friends and, more interestingly, her enemies. Though it is sometimes difficult to like Scarlett, it is impossible to ever hate Mitchell's messages throughout this amazing epic novel.",
            "I agree with the woman from the UK. This is ridiculous. Slavery was horrible but guess what ? It happened, so I guess what we should conclude from what you are saying is that we should just forget about Hitler and the concentration camps and pretend like it never happened. The world can be a horrible place so while we're here why don't we face the facts and try to learn from history. Besides, history repeats itself. So, back to the book. WOW! This is the best book I've ever read. Reading this book you realize how horrible slavery was but also what hell Southerner's went through during this period. After all nearly one-fourth of the population of the U.S. was wiped out because of the Civil war and it tells about the people who really changed the South, the carpetbaggers! I saw the movie and after having read the book I can't believe some of the powerful scenes they left out. Like when the Union soldiers were going through Tara and almost took Charles' sword. Or when the Calvert girl came to tell everyone she was going to marry. It just goes on and on. Did you know that MM wrote GWTW for her own pleasure and never thought of herself as a good writer. One day a publisher friend from NY dropped by and saw hundreds of sheets of papers in dissaray and asked if he could look at them. MM had refused to let anybody read what she had been writing but said yes to this guy for some reason then felt self-consious almost immediatley after he left and asked for them back the next day. He said he would never give them back and published them.",
            "Gone With The Wind (GWTW abbreviated for those who are hardcore fans) was a tremendously successful novel, earning its well-deserved title as an American literary masterpiece. Spun from the imagination and supposedly blurry, slightly realistic accounts of Margaret Mitchell and her friends (Mitchell said the characters were based on some of her acquiantances, as she grew up listening to Civil War accounts in the South), the novel took America by storm in the 30's. It was the Great Depression, a time that severely hurt the nation's economy. We were then a nation on the brink of war (sounds like our present time, does'nt it ?), World War II being just around the corner. Mitchell had written short novels that are unfortunately unknown to most readers and sold rarely in bookstores, but GWTW was her only great novel, her magnum opus, her legacy. She took it upon herself to write the great American novel, and she managed quite well. The novel deals with the life-altering Civil War, its effects principally on the main characters, a coquettish, strong-willed, male-manipulating survivor Southern belle, Scarlett O'Hara, an equally strong and slick man of ill-gotten means, Rhett Butler, Ashley Wilkes, of whom Scarlett is enamored and who is a reserved, elegant aristocrat and his wife Melanie Hamilton. The barrage of characters, from the Tarleton twins, to the comedic, gossipy Aunt Pittypat, to the slaves, including Mammy. The novel is very long, and of course, in order to truly enjoy the epic scope of the narrative, one must take time to read. A first read this novel in junior high, devouring every page, immersed in the tragedy and the triumphs that Scarlett faced during what must have been the hardest time for Americans in the nineteenth century. Similarily, the movie, in my opinion, related to the Americans of the 30's, having gone through the Depression, looking forward for resurrection and triumph despite all odds. As Scarlett's motto and unforgettable creed went, &quot;Tomorrow is another day.&quot; Themes of hope, nostalgia and unrequited love abound in this masterful story. I hope you read the novel if you have not and then view the film, rather than other way around. I saw the film first, then read the novel. You will find how DIFFERENT the book is from the movie, and how much more grandeur there is in the novel and how much more developed the characters are (i.e. Scarlett is supposed to have had children with her two husbands before her marriage to Butler). It was not difficul to imagine the characters in the novel looking and speaking as the actors did in the film - Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh, etc. But if you read closely, the characters are definately Southern, bourgeois, prudish, scandalous and quite Victorian in manners. Five stars for the great American novel, five stars for Margaret Mitchell. Gone With The Wind has stood the test of time.",
            "Okay. Raise your hands. How many have seen the movie but not read the book? Come on raise em! I thought so. I'm not taking anything away from the film. I love it, one of my favorites, watched it a gazillion times, but I just read the book for the 2nd time, the first time was, well long time ago. Even though I thought I knew the whole story, I realized there was so much more to the characters and the story.This tale of the South begins on the eve of the Civil War, and centers around a Southern belle, Scarlett O'Hara. Scarlett is a young Belle, with many beau. The young men are buzzing around her. She is the daughter of a wealthy plantation owner, she is spoiled,concieted, and shallow. Her sole purpose in life is to look good and catch a worthy husband.She has hope only for one though,Ashley Wilkes, who is bethrothed to Melanie Hamilton. Her whole life changes, as war breaks out, the Yankees are winning, many of her beau are dieing in the war. She is forced to do things,never in her life would she have thought she must. She must nurse the wounded, work her father's plantation, (as most of the slaves have been set free by the Yankees, or have just run off),she must care for her family, and save the faimly home from the Yankees. Even as the war ends, she still must continue to keep \"Tara\" (the family plantation) out of the hands of Carpetbaggers, and Scalliwags.Scarlett at her young and tender age will do whatever it takes to keep from going hungry and tattered like the rest of the southerners. This includes taking up with the likes of one Rhett Butler. Although the rest of Atlanta see's him as a low life friend to the Yankees, Scarlett see him as a means to end.He is rich, and like Scarlett doesnt really care what anyone else thinks. Rhett comes in and out of her life over the next several years always seeming to come to her resue, and they eventually marry, but not, according to Scarlett for love.Throughout the story we see Scarlett getting stronger with every tradgedy that besets her, and there are many. The loss of her parents, 2 husbands, a child, and of course the war. But what we also see is the loss of her youth and and the way of life she was born to have. In their place we see courage and tenacity,a woman who could run her own business (unheard of in those days), a woman who could shoulder anything that might come her way.It takes the death of Melanie for Scarlett to realize, what she already has in her life that is good. But is it too late?As I mentioned in the beginning, there is so much more in the book then you will see in the movie. There is a depth in some of the characters, like Melanie and Gerald O'hara(Scarlett's father), and more light is shed upon the relationship between the planatation owners and the slaves, we understand Scarlett,and her love for the land a little more, and see more to Rhett. There are other characters too, important to the lives of the main characters, Scarlett has two children besides Bonnie, there is a convict that has entered the lives of all, and the realtionship with Mammy is touched on more so than in the movie. Mrs. Mitchell never forgets to give us descriptions of the land,the war, and the people that will stick with you. We also get more of the history of the war and it's ravages on the South, the aftermath, the formation of \"The Klan\", and much more.Although we might disagree with the politics of the story, like how women were thought of, or the treatment of African American as slaves, Mrs. Mitchell paints us a clear vision of how things were. It was an era in American History that is, well, \"Gone With The Wind\"If you have never read this book or seen the movie, I tried only to give a taste of the story. I hope it has wet your appetite, read the book first, you won't be able to put it down.You will get lost in another time and place.If you have only seen the movie, this will fill in the blanks for you, and you can picture the faces and voices of the characters you know.Happy reading........Laurie P.S. There is also a wonderful sequel to the story calledScarlett: The Sequel to Margaret Mitchell's \"Gone With the Wind\", by Alexandra Ripley(see my review for book details)",
            "This is, beyond all doubt, the greatest novel of all time. It has everything: characters that leap off the pages, a thrillling plot, a powerful philosophy, and a universality that extends beyond the events it catalogues. This is an epic of mammoth proportions that tells not only one story but explores a whole way of living. I wept, cried, and laughed reading this book. This is more than a novel, it is a manual for living. This is not because the characters are perfect or even wholly admirable but because through their experiences we have the opportunity of seeing the world through a completely new lens. Add to this the fact that Scarlett and Rhett have one of the most exciting romances of all time and through this novel we literally have the opportunity to relive the passionate struggles of the Civil War. More than being a story about North and South, it is a story about rising out of the ashes of your own destruction and fighting on when all hope is gone. This is truly a novel that everyone should read. It made me a stronger person and taught me that no matter how bad things get, &quot;Tomorrow is another day.&quot;",
            "I still love it! and it is still remains my favorite novel. I read this as a teenager, and now again 30 years later. To me, it is one of those books that makes me sad for people who don't read, who miss out on the profound life altering and enjoyable experience that books can bring.After reading it again, later in life, I see that it was a book that could have been a huge influence to my early thinking. When I was in High School, early 70's, I was the only one of my friends and family who spoke out against racism... and in a time of racial riots, high emotion and tensions. Racism has always been a passionate issue for me...also woman's issues. The unfairness and stupidities, some blatantly obvious to me, and some not so obvious. Some discrimination I was unaware of for years, even though I looked for them, and was super sensitized to them. But we were all so brain washed, right from the cradle. It is still an evolving process of enlightenment, and will be for a long time to come. These issues have been such passionate issues for me... I now believe, after reading it again, that Gone With the Wind, has been one of those books, that did help inspire my thinking in those formative years. Margaret Mitchell was a great and courageous thinker....before her time. Her insights and knowledge on the Civil War in particular, were impressive for a woman of her times. Her thoughts of the motivations and impetuous behind wars, and the tearing down and building up of civilizations, is inspiring and thought provoking.In the character of Scarlet O'Hara, the rebellious, courageous, strong, engaging, not so sweet Southern bell, she wonderfully sheds light on the foolish traditions and conventions of society, particularly for the women in that unique disintegrating society of Southern Gentility. I think, the brilliance in the creation of that character and the story line allows her to get away with a very feminist and enlightened attitude, that I am sure was still very unpopular, but struggling to get free, in the 1920s and 30's.Also the ambiguities of racism, that existed in the North and the South, she subtly weaves in and about her story. All of it led me to wonder what the attitudes were in Margaret Mitchell's day, and what reading materials had shaped her thinking, during her life.To think that it was her first novel is mind boggling to me. Her thoughts and ideas are still timely today and indeed are timeless. I feel we missed out on some great works when she lost confidence in herself and refused to write again, then was killed so young. Maybe she just lost her heart and spirit, fighting to be herself in a hostile world toward women, and became a burnt out blazing star. I think she was someone I could've related to (not saying that I am a burnt out star LOL, maybe a burnt out light bulb LOL) I would have liked to have known her. She was an independent, rebellious spirit, intolerant of stupid ideas, conventions and traditions imposed by society, which only serves to keep certain segments of the population in control, of men and the wealthy.For a Southern Bell to have had such spirit, passion and intelligence, must have been very hard and lonely for Margaret Mitchell, during her lifetime. She was obviously a very thoughtful and well read person. She must have put up a good fight, I am sure, for her day and circumstances, she must have come up against a lot, and must've certainly been a very special person as well as gifted and talented.Through her skillfull and inspired writing, it was like she was actually there, a witness of the times.... maybe when she conceived the idea for the novel, or maybe, as a young child, civil war veterans could still have been alive and telling stories to her personally ... just think ... wow ... A great book, thought provoking, exciting, informative, and just plain good story telling. I could really imagine the feel and taste of the gritty dusty roads, smell the mud from the rain and the horse dung on the streets, I could imagine hunger, what hominy tastes like, what tight stays feel like, what an unwashed man smells like, I could imagine what the countryside, farms and cityscapes were like, the sounds, sights and smells. The whole experience inflamed my imagination and absorbed my mind.My only criticism of the book is that it could have been edited a little better, some areas were repetitive, but really it only adds to the charm of the book. If it was too perfect it would have been too sterile and may have missed some of the innocence of emotion that carried through. I am glad I read it again....Kathy Struewing",
            "This book is very good, and a page turner. Although many people say that the book is racist, and the author must be too, hardly anyone knows the truth about Margaret Mitchell. She started a program to help get African Americans into college, and that before her time, when there was still lots of prejudice going on. Yes it may sound like a sugar-coated world in GWTW, and it sort-of was back then, until the war hit. Also, you have to consider that the book is FICTION, while it is still historical fiction.",
            "When I saw this book on my mom's bookshelf two years ago, I wanted to read it because I thought that that would make me a &quot;grown up&quot;. But reading it was better than that. I was fascinated by the Southern way of life, as I had only heard bad things about the Confederacy in my history class (it was soooo one-sided). It seemed so beautiful, what with the chivalrous gentlemen and their demure ladies. It was a world where Melanie completely belonged, but Scarlett was in the wrong age. I was so frusterated to see how Scarlett had to forfeit friends and society to keep herself alive. It's hard to like her, but it's impossible not to! She's cold, dismissive to her friends, and uses her looks to get her way- but you like her anyway, no matter how much you admire the other characters for their sweetness and chivalry. You like that she's willing to do everything for Ashley, for Gerald, for Tara. And you're upset when Rhett leaves her even though she completely deserved it. She can get things done, and she will, and we like her. For me, the face of the Confederacy will always be the face of Scarlett O'Hara- con artist, tart, hypocrite, and so much more. And yet still, a part of me wishes that I had been a part of that face.",
            "...This great book.... I read it when I was 16 and since then I read it countless times. Every character and all the dialounge I love. Charles declaration of love to Scarlett is sooo cute. GranMa's Fontaine's remincing of the massacre of her family was perfectly done. Mammy's telling of Rhett going out of his mind after Bonnie's death. Scarlett promise to never going hungry again is a complete classic that every Southerner should learn and know by heart. Melanie's giving birth to Beau is so real. NO women that small and narrow should give birth and if she does she should thank God she lived after the birth. Scarlett's telling Melanie to scream and not to be brave sounded like my mother when Mother told my sister to yell all she wanted. My nephew weighed eleven pounds. There is so much I want to say here. I really will never understand the non-reading public. The stories here in this book are so beatiful. Even if the Story is old and long how can persn resist after the first page. Scarlett to me is a real person. So what if she is spoiled brat. At least she knows what she wants. But...her being in love with Ashley is beyond me. He is pathetic. Rhett. Wow!! What a man. Now that is a Man I would love to have for myself. Again I will never under Scarlett here. What was she thinking in letting a fine man like Rhett to get away mooning over a man like Ashley, then realizing too late that she never \"really\" loved him? WELL, I least I hope I know she had to have gotten him back. And, I'm not talking at all about that horrid book \"SCARLETT\" either. I don't need that book to continue the story for me. I like to think I can continue the story in my mind. After all tomorrow is another day.",
            "Margaret Mitchell's requiem of the South succeeds to embrace both the reader and her topic because of the tremendous blend of themes which resound throughout this masterful novel.First, she introduces us to the concept of peace versus war: \"All wars are sacred, to those who have to fight them. If the people who started them did not make wars sacred, who would be foolish enough to fight?\" And, of course business pragmatist Rhett Butler concludes, \"All wars are in realty money squabbles. But so few people ever realize it. Their ears are too full of bugles and drums . . . \" This dialogue of sanctity of war versus business pragmatism constantly resounds in the book.Secondly, is how men treat other men. And, within this theme are numerous subtopics. The most obvious is the North versus the South. \"Arrogance and callousness for the conquerors, bitter endurance and hatred for the conquered.\" When you start a war - know that at the end you still have an enemy, and that enemy's feelings toward you may be stronger and more bitter! The other obvious theme is white versus black. Slavery versus freedom for the \"darkies.\" And, although that serfdom appears to symbiotically exist in the Camelot of the Georgian south, Ashley Wilkes tells Scarlett O'Hara at one time that had there been no war and had his father died with slavery still intact, he would have freed his slaves as his methodically conceived logical conclusion was to do the right thing : free men.Ashley Wilkes, who displays another great theme of old antebellum South's gentlemen in the new world of the Reconstruction South, is both hero and goat. Rhett Butler always tells Scarlett that Ashley's days of importance ended when his environs were burnt to ashes at the war's end. She never agrees, at least until the end. And, while she disagrees with Rhett about Ashley, they gang up on her on yet another masterful man versus man theme: employment of convict labor. Treated worse than slaves, convicts are the backbone to cheap labor after the war. But, for their hard work they are beaten and fed little and paid less. Ashley, in her post-starvation period, will do almost everything to avoid experiencing hunger again - including hiring white northerners to be her conscripted laborers.Thirdly, we learn about truth versus appearance. Rhett and most of the old South depict the wonderment of southern civility - never say a bad thing about anyone, and always show respect and manners to those about you. This applies to many slaves as well. Ashley and his wife, Melanie (Melly), are embodiments of such gentile mannerisms. Scarlett's mother Ellen was another. Scarlett's father, Gerald O'Hara, and Scarlett are not. But, Scarlett and her father were truthful. The Irish in father and daughter refused to fub, they refused to be concerned about the foderol scurried about by gossip - holding such lack of care when the idle gossip festered to outright defamatory lies. Rhett, who loves the lack of deception in Scarlett's character, often criticizes his peers for their hypocrisy. Rhett admits to engaging in the same for purposes of business; but, as a man he refuses to be known as another who says what he does not mean. But, Rhett, as time progresses in the book, succumbs to the gossip and engages in the very hypocrisy he despises.Fourthly, the issue of uneven playing field resounds. Rich versus poor. Slave owner versus slave. Business owner versus convict labor. South versus North. And, hidden within these themes is Mitchell's greatest announcement: feminism. Scarlett who owns businesses after the war, is criticized by all men and societal women for engaging in a man's world. Even with her success, she is snubbed by the hob nob crowd. But, perhaps greatest in this theme is the concept of men having rights which women cannot. Rhett gallivants with the local prostitute Belle without concern, while one emotional hug held by life-long friends and neighbors Scarlett and Ashley is identified as \"adultery.\" When Rhett confronts her about this, Scarlett retaliates, \"You are nothing but a drunken beast who's been with bad women so long that you can't understand anything else but badness. You've lived in dirt too long to know anything else. You are jealous of something you can't understand. Good night.\"Other themes also exist: building versus destroying; growing up versus growing old; Catholics versus Christians; love for family versus love for spouses; raising children versus burying children . . .As these themes ebb and flow and occasionally eddy in this ocean-sized novel, the characters' personalities grow and become embodiments of many stereotypical Southern mainstays. And, to add to the characters, Mitchell uses incredibly detailed phonetic spellings for the crackers' and slaves' dialogues. Her detailed description of people's clothing and household interiors (and exteriors) brand indelible images into the readers' minds. This is writing!Mitchell, whose own life is a mixture of angelic Melly and defiant Scarlett, had three marriages and worked (as a journalist) in a man's world. She knew that her publication would be much more difficult than a man's work - especially one of such largess. But, like Scarlett, she persevered and triumphed. Mitchell's name remains among the most known in the American literary world - not bad for a small girl from Atlanta.So many passages of this book flow with delicate prose that make it an incredibly easy 960-page read. In Pat Conroy's preface, that great southern writer states, \"This is The Illiad with a Southern accent, burning with the humiliation of Reconstruction. . . Gone with the Wind was not just a book, it was an answer, a clenched fist raised to the North, an anthem of defiance. If you could not defeat the Yankees on the battlefield, then by God, one of your women could rise from the ashes of humiliation to write more powerfully than the enemy and all the historians and novelists who sang the praises of the Union.\"",
            "Gone with the Wind is the story of Scarlett O'Hara (and so much more). When the reader meets Scarlett, it is pre-civil war in the South. The reader gets to see plantation life on Tara and in the Country as it really was. Mitchell takes the reader through the Civil War, how life changed for those that didn't go of to war, how life changed for everyone after it, the mentality of those who survived it and how they lived afterwards. The reader gets to watch these character develop and change with the times.Mitchell's character description is amazing! As a reader, you feel transported into this world, as if these characters are your friends, and as if you are a part of this town - just another neighbor. You will feel for each and everyone in some way at some time. You'll not want to put the book down, nor will you want it to end....What can one really say about this book other than it is a great read and one that everyone should pick up!",
            "Many people only know Gone With The Wind through the beautiful 1939 David O. Selznick film. That is a disappointment, as the novel is so much richer and complex than the film could realize.Written in the mid 1930s by a novice writer, it nonethe less manages to evoke the spirit of the Civil War and the passion that is Scarlett O'Hara.While commonly viewed as a war novel, it is actually much more: both a brilliant comedy of manners and the first frankly feminist novel written. Ms. Mitchell manages to make us care about Scarlett, while allowing us also to laugh at her occasionally.Do not be put off by the book's length. While an enormous undertaking, it moves along at a breakneck pace, and is absorbing from the very first page.Some have criticized the book for its racist portrayal of the black characters. While it does seem so from a 21st Century perspective, that can perhaps be forgiven when remembering that it was written by a Southerner in the early 20th Century. In any event, some of the most noble, sympathetic characters of the book are black and slaves.This is a book to enjoy and savor more than once. The 60th Anniversary Edition is especially nice, coming in a slipcover and containing analysis of the book by other authors and literary critics.",
            "If you read the other customer reviews, you will definitely guess that people love this book. They really, really love it.I read this book primarily because it is such a major piece of 20th century American Literature and film and I'm glad I read it. Several friends saw the book on my table and assumed my wife was reading it. I took some teasing over it.I liked it more than I expected to but I couldn't quite get past some of the views expressed or supported. I do think Mitchell goes further than just showing how southerners thought of blacks and actually has sympathy for some of the attitudes.Mitchell writes a lot of good scenes and social situations. Scarlett is quite a character. She is selfish, egotistical, forceful and mean. She's also loyal, smart and has incredible inner strength. To Margaret Mitchell's credit, she wrote an incredibly strong female character who is consistently interesting.For a 1000ish page book, it moves quickly but I really did find it to be way, way too long. A lot of the book simply reinforces the Scarlett character and, for me, she could have left out quite a bit of it without losing much. When you love a book, it can't be too long so I expect your view of the book's length will depend on how much you're enjoying it.If I could have forgotten the attitudes expressed towards slavery then I would have given this a higher rating. I couldn't manage to do it though. There are many books with accurate depictions of slavery and the attitude of whites towards slaves and they are very powerful. I think the character that bothers me the most is Rhett Butler. He is a smart, dashing scoundrel who loves Scarlett and is the only one who really knows her nature. He is also a character who admittedly shot a n----r for getting uppity with a white. I realize it was written in the 1930s and described a violent time but I still had some difficulty with it.The book is loaded with memorable quotes and it is a classic with larger than life characters that people love.So, I expect many readers will continue to love this book and I don't begrudge them that but I just couldn't get past certain things. The 3 star rating is almost an abstention regarding whether I recommend it.",
            "As powerful today as when it came out more than 70 years ago. Criticisms that it glorifies the Confederacy are misguided. While still honoring those who survived incredible hardship and loss, Margaret Mitchell skewers the pretensions of those who blindly believed in \"The Cause.\" Her portrayal of how blacks were treated manages to convey her obvious belief that in many respects some slaves were better people than their masters. A great love story set in the midst of a war that is fought mostly offstage. Her prose is magnificent, creating characters and a world that are unique in American literature. An aside: Hollywood did a magnificent job making a classic movie from such a huge book.",
            "Gone With The Wind is timeless. Though the movie gives an overview of the book, there is so much more that is revealed in the book. It reveals much more about each character; it gives a background about Tara and its acquistion; it gives more insight into the relationships between the characters. The historical era is described so that the reader can understand the southern culture of that time. I have read the book at least 5 times, and each time I get something new from the book.",
            "The book was so much better than the movie. One of my new favorite books, will read over and over.",
            "\"And she heard for the first time, without knowing it, the Rebel yell.\"I read Gone With the Wind years ago but was so happy to revisit it as a book club choice. I was surprised by how many people struck up a conversation about it as I carried it with me when I travelled. Imagine writing something that still instigates conversations and connections among strangers who have only this book in common? Love it or hate it, you can't deny the impact it's had.The first time I read this I was in my early 20's. I fell completely in love with every moment. Over 10 years later I was surprised by how my reactions to the characters changed. I had less tolerance for Scarlett and increased respect for Melanie. I was more affected by the soldiers and less swept up in the romance. I still thought Ashley needed a backbone...Despite those differences, my love for the characters did not change. My favorite characters are those with flaws. I cannot become completely encompassed by perfection but prefer some characteristics I can love and some I can hate. In that, Gone With the Wind is spot on. I hope I find this book in my hand a third time, another 10 years from now.",
            "A true American classic, Gone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell is a must read for anyone who likes a good story about survival, betrayal, love, and historical fiction. Set in the Old South before, during, and after the Civil War, Scarlett O'Hara must grow up, leave her comfort zone and survive numerous hardships. Although the movie has caught the essence of the book, actually reading this novel is a must for every independent woman in America.",
            "I first read Gone with the Wind when I was in high school. I was 16 and didn't care much about anything, but this book grabbed my attention and held it. I had grown up in an old and established family from the South and had heard all the tales of the horrors of the 'time of our most recent unpleasantness', but Margret Michell's book brought those times to life. Yes, I know what people say about Mitchell and this book, but what was is. You can't change history just because you don't like it. I didn't and don't like a lot of my ancestor's choices, either, but it's there just the same.Anyhow, from the journals I've read (and I've now read lots of them) and my own personal history passed down from word of mouth, I think Ms. Mitchell did a good job of capturing a bygone era. In a word, I'm as captivated by this book in my older years as I was at 16. The book lives.",
            "There are good reasons why Gone With The Wind, published 73 years ago, is a classic among classics, a Pulitzer Prize winner, and has sold over 28 million copies in more than 37 countries. The reasons are that it is an unparalleled monumental epic of the American South that is very rich in historical facts, it has superbly developed unforgettable characters, a narrarative that is so captivating that the reader will feel he/she is right there experiencing all that was going on, and it truly stands the test of time. I enjoyed reading it at least as much now (and possibly more) than when I first read it over 45 years ago. While Gone With The Wind is often marketed as \"the greatest love story of our time,\" it is so much more than that. If you haven't read Gone With The Wind or haven't done so in many years, do yourself a tremendous favor and read it/read it again as soon as possible. It's an experience you'll savor for years to come.",
            "I can understand why Gone with the wind has been considered as a classic. This is Margaret Mitchelle's unforgettable tale of love and hate, gain and lost, life and death, of a nation divided, of the American people being torn apart by the civil war. This is the story of honourable but weak Ashley Wilkes, who lives in his own world, of Melanie Wilkes, who is no less than an angel, of the Fontaines, the Tarletons, the O'Haras and many other Geogians. This is the story of the black and white Southerners before, during, and after the war. Above all, it is the story of Captain Rhett Butler and the beautiful, determined, strong-willed but ignorant and ruthless Scarlett O'Hara.Gone with the wind is an outstanding read!",
            "Five stars is not enough to rate this timeless, flawless epic novel of the South. Miss Mitchell's talent has never been underrated or under-appreciated, but having read it as a teen - then, again recently, after having read \"Rhett Butler's People,\" the authorized sequel to GWTW commissioned by the Mitchell estate, I am newly appreciative of Miss Mitchell's prodigious talent.For those who have only seen the equally terrific, but different, movie, please read Mitchell's original.The movie does stand on its own. I am a fan of novels-turned-books and have seen many. I never denigrate a movie if it differed from the original novel in any way. The two are different media.But Mitchell's only novel earned her a place forever in American literature and is desrving to be read in its entirety.Though long, it is a quick read for the engaged reader.I have not read the much-ballyhooed but often best-seller, unauthorized sequels, but I will do so, mostly out of curiosity.The authorized sequel, Rhett Butler's People, is also interesting, but can never live up to Mitchell's GWTW.",
            "I read this book as a teenager and have absolutely loved it ever since. The descriptive quality of writing that Margaret Mitchell utilizes brings the story and its characters to life. It gives an good glimpse of the state of affairs in the antebellum and postbellum South.I've read this on several occasions, and each time I get just as much enjoyment as I did the first! Excellent!",
            "Gone with the Wind is one of the rare stories that delivers exactly what you wouldn't expect. Nothing about it is predictable, nothing is cliche. The heroine is infintely less of a heroine than ever before - she's Scarlett, the spoiled, selfish Southern daughter of a plantation owner, used to having everything handed to her on a silver platter. During the period of the Civil War, she is forced to grow up and become a woman, but she never loses childish inclinations to selfishness and pettiness.Enter Rhett Butler, the conceited, vulgar 'Yankee' whom Scarlett despises and yet, is fascinated by. Though he is not quite a hero as Scarlett is not a heroine, he has become one of America's most beloved leading men.Gone with the Wind is startling in its storyline and realism, and does not gloss over the brutality and harsh outcomings of the Civil War - on both sides.I purchased my copy of Gone with the Wind at a library. The book had not been used by the library, but donated and then put for sale. I paid $3 for it - in very good condition. It was a 40th Anniversary Edition complete with slipcase. It is positively beautiful, and I could not have gotten a better bargain. Aside from some mild use and wear, and a name written in pencil on the first page, its in perfect condition. An excellent copy - I read it over and over.",
            "Love in the time of war! You can't beat it. The first time I read this book I was interested in the love story. When I read it again, I was mesmerized with the portrait of a time and place which have been erased from our collection memory by layers of political correctness. This paperback edition is lovely, by the way, and it doesn't break apart the way some big paperbacks can.",
            "I first read this book when I was a teenager. It has never lost its appeal to me. This epic saga emcompasses all of the major elements -- love, war, history, and memorable characters -- particularly the charismatic, witchy heroine Scarlett O'Hara and her male counterpart, Rhett Butler. Starting when Scarlett was sixteen, and the belle of the county, with dozens of beaus, she quickly moves with the times when war sweeps the antebellum South. In love with bookish, sensitive Ashley, she sees him off to the Civil War while marrying someone else, just because Ashley married someone else. She is quickly widowed, and journeys to Atlanta to stay with relatives. She has her eye on Rhett Butler, a stockade captain who plans to make money out of \"the fall of a civilization.\" For everything about the old life is being swept away in war -- \"cotton, slaves, and arrogance.\" Over the course of the novel, she slowly discovers who she truly loves, and goes for him. But he is too proud to reveal his true feelings for her, as she stubbornly clings to another man. Saving her plantation home from carpetbaggers, she decides to marry Rhett. It takes two tragedies for her to find out who has been saving her as a damsel in distress all of these years, and that he \"loves her to distraction.\" The novel is full of truths and themes that coincide again and again -- love triangles, the fall of an era and who survives the times in style, and friendship, family, and true love.",
            "Gone With the Wind was a fantastic book. It's about this young woman, Scarlett O'Hara, who is living during the Civil War-in the south. Her rich and perfect life is ruined once the south loses the war and she is thrown into a time of starvation and misery. She becomes a widow and has to face those troubles as well.Mitchell created the character, Scarlett, wonderfully. She had spunk, determination, intelligence, and selfishness-traits that made her personality interesting. She does what ever she needs to get her by. Then there's Rhett. He's this dashing man who is no gentleman. I have to say, he brought a little bit of light into the dark parts of the book. He seems to be just a rude, mischevious man at first, but later on, Mitchell makes his character more full, shall I say. His character is deep and full of emotion and feelings-I really can't describe it.Then Margaret Mitchell created a bond and passion between these two characters. It was a wonderful romance, with love and anger-a sort of bittersweet romance. I felt I could connect with these characters.I loved this novel; I couldn't put it down. I read it at a young age, 11 to be exact, but I was into it none the less. It kept me hooked for 7 weeks until I finally finished it. It's long-really long-but absolutely worth it. I loved it, loved it, loved it! This book tied together historical fiction and romance, my favorite types of books, into one novel. It is a book not to be forgotten-ever.",
            "If you've never read GWTW, put it next on your list! Scarlett O'Hara is a true southern belle who was living in a dream world with nothing more to worry her pretty little head than what to wear to the next party. Suddenly she finds herself doing the work formerly done by her slaves, delivering a baby, and having become a widow due to the War between the States. This is a story I have read 7 or 8 times in the past. This time I purchased it in large print for my 93-year old mother who wanted to read it again. I may need that large print myself before long!",
            "I bought this as a Christmas present for my mother. She has loved \"Gone With the Wind\" for decades, and I can remember sitting and watching it with her, when we only had one television. This particular book was nothing like the edition I bought her years ago, but it was lost in a long distance move, and I've never found another one like it. This copy takes it's place admirably.",
            "Definately not what I was expecting! I thought this would be one of those book where the characters fall head over heels in love. The romance was developed much more slowly, but was fitting with the plot.The novel is long, but very well-written. It will take you back to the late 19th century and give you a feel for what it was like to live in that time.I wasn't crazy about the ending, as I wished it would be happier, and left me wishing more had been written. I suppose the real ending was meant to be guessed.If you're looking for a good read and you don't mind if it takes some time, I would highly reccomend this book. Truly a classic!",
            "No, I had never read it. My knowledge of it came from the movie. A dear family member was re-reading it, and when I said I never had, she told me it was a must read. I didn't see why, but on her advice, I bought it and read, cover to cover. It is so much better than just the movie. The history of the South and the changes to life the war brought are incredible. Yes, I agree, it is a must read.",
            "First of all, the book is fantastic! Second of all, I could not ask for it to be in better condition! Even being shipped up to Alaska it came in great time and in great condition. I would recommend this book to everyone!",
            "I have read this book several times and it never dissappoints. The main characters; Scarlett, Rhett, Melanie, Ashley, Mammy along with others to numerous to mention are vivid in the minds eye. You are swept up by the turmoil the South suffered during the Civil War and Reconstruction. Ultimately, it is the love story of all time. A must read!",
            "This book is a true classic. The horrors of the civil war and learning how to live after the defeat and destruction of a culture have been brought to life in a spectacular way. Its unusual in the fact the main character is easy to dislike yet an honest look at flawed human character gains a respect for her. Almost every aspect of the human condition are encountered here within the pages. The movie version while enjoyable lacks the depth of characters and completely omits some characters. Highly recommended!",
            "A classic, I couldn't wait to download this to my Kindle. There is everything you could hope and dream of in this book. Scarlett is so complicated, yet real. My all time favorite book.",
            "The first time I read this Pulitzer winner was when I was in high school. The movie had just been re-released and my best friend and I saw it about 8 times. She still had the best plot description I've ever heard: \"This is the story of Rhett Butler who loves Scarlett O'Hara, who loves Ashley Wilkes, who loves Melanie Hamilton, who loves everyone, including the town tart Belle Watling, who loves Rhett Butler, who loves Scarlett...\"I've since read the book a second and now a third time and recognize more depth than our first summary. Yes, it is still a love story. But it is also a quintessential Southern book, a quintessential great American novel, a quintessential exploration of war and its aftermath, and a quintessential character study of Scarlett O'Hara's evolution from spoiled girl to unstoppable woman.Mitchell has crafted a 1000-page book that reads like a short novel. The characters who people her book present the full spectrum of human traits, from best to worst. These are the qualities that make the book such an enduring favorite, and really a classic work of literature.Is the book without flaws? Of course not. I cringe at the romantic version of the Ku Klux Klan. I am appalled at how often she compares the \"darkies\" to children or, worse yet, apes. But I am still caught up in the story, and that is the reason most people read novels - for a good story. And it was the story that first captured my attention and my heart, and it is the story that still earns it 5 stars.Linda Stephens does a fine job of narrating the audio version, though I thought her Scarlett sounded too mature at the beginning of the book - Scarlett is only 16 when we first meet her, and I thought her voice should have a higher pitch.",
            "My stepmom collects all things Gone With The Wind so this was a perfect gift for her at a decent price. The book came in its own case and did not have a scratch or mark of any kind on it. My stepmom loved her perfect present and do did my pocketbook.",

            "Gone With the WindBy Margaret MitchellGone with the Wind was first published in May, 1936, and won the Pulitzer Prize in 1937; the novel linearly chronicles the enchanting and lyrical Old South, the brutal ravages of the Civil War upon the South and the subsequent struggle for reconstruction. Moreover, Gone With the Wind tells the tale of the strong-willed, crafty and determined, Katie \"Scarlett\" O'Hara; one of the most famous female characters in literature (and film - due to the 1939 movie of the same name).The book is a significant read, it was originally published at 1037 pages and now finishes at 1024. But it is well-worth the effort to pour your heart and time into this romantic, courageous and historical novel. If in doubt, consider the fact that it sold $176,000 copies within the first few weeks (at an unprecedented $3 apiece), and has gone on to sell over 30 million copies. Scarlett is considered by many to be the most intriguing female character ever written, and the novel typically tops the \"Most Romantic\" books lists. It took author, Margaret Mitchell, over seven years to write the story and it is the only book she ever published.The story is set in Atlanta, Georgia. Scarlett, the daughter of a wealthy Irish plantation owner, has made up her mind that she is in love with the charming and chivalrous Ashley Wilkes. However, Ashley has committed to marrying his gracious and even-tempered cousin, Melanie Hamilton. Their marriage puts high-minded Scarlett into a lifelong tailspin of ill-fated marriages and emotional conflict. In the meantime, she has the roguish, handsome and financially secure Rhett Butler in the wings for most of the story and eventually marries him but this proves equally tumultuous and ruinous for both of them.This is not a straight-forward love story; rather it is a assortment box of every type of human love imaginable. There is love for one's heritage (the Old South), land (the great Tara Plantation), children (she has four pregnancies), parents (who die), spouses (she has three) lovers, friends, and foes. This is also the story of strength, struggle, and self-realization. It is only at the end of the novel that Scarlett is finally able to distinguish and reconcile the difference between real love and starry-eyed infatuation.The spirited and intrepid Scarlett gives this epic novel wings to soar for over a thousand pages. She is a plucky character who approaches life with the resilience of a determined adventurer. Her intelligent, hard-working, go-getter attitude gives the story backbone, but it is her loves, longings and grievous losses that give it substance. Ultimately, it is her uncompromising ability to fight for herself, and for those she loves, that makes her the heroine of the novel and of the hearts of those who read it.Beth Walz[...]",
            "I loved all the nfo from the book that the movie couldn't give, it was a goo, but long read.",
            "My mother requested this book for Christmas. We had gone together to see the movie years ago and it is one of her favorite stories. I purchased the book for a Christmas gift for her and she loved it!",
            "Gone With The Wind can be praised in so many words, so many sentences, so many paragraphs, so many pages, that I could simple sit here in front of my computer all day and night raveing on it's every spender and glory. With every word that i put on the screen would bring an even bigger smile to my face. This is not just a book, no it's not even a legend, it goes so farther than that. The word to describe this masterpeice has not been created because nothing till its puplication could have deserved it. I often find myself tring to react to situations in the manner that I think my beloved romodel would have. I have built dreams around this book! I plan to move to the south and live happily knowing it was the base for such workmanship!! I Love The Book!!",
            "I hesitated in reading Gone With the Wind, thinking it would be boring and long. It is long, but definitely not boring. I loved all of the characters -- each with their distinct personalities, strengths and weaknesses. I couldn't put the book down. The film does not even capture one tenth of the gloriousness of Margaret Mitchell's words.",
            "I loved this book. It couldn't have been better. I think that Alexandra Ripley (who wrote Scarlett:The sequel . . .) was wrong to try and &quot;fix&quot; GWTW. It can't be fixed. She didn't realize that Rhett's and Scarlett's relationship couldn't be fixed. GWTW was perfect, and I think Scarlett was cool even if she was spoiled. She's very pretty in the movie. =)",
            "This is by far the best book I have ever read. It is the epitimy of what a love story should be. My favorite character from the book is of course, Scarlett O'Hara, because of her passion for life and her southern charm. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone.",
            "Gone with the wind is the best and most unbelievable book I've ever read. It has so much going on and the characters are so interesting you are drawn to them and their lives. Despite the fact that the book is over a thousand pages, I was sorry when it was over! It was amazing.",
            "I think this book was a wonderful story and very, very well written. The author did a great job of descibing every detail right down to the size of Scarlett's dress. From the moment Scarlett O'Hara met Rhett Butler to the last page the story was filled with excitement, joy, and sorrow. This is the best book I have ever read and I would reccommend it to everyone",
            "The atory is written through Scarlets eyes . It tells of a spoilled southern Belle's life when the war begins and after it ends. While reading the book you also get a feel for the changes that the south went through. while Scarlet is defenatly a girl with spirt she is also a selfish mule. In Mammy's words &quot;a mule with a hores harness. I would defenatly say that the book is written for anyone with any heart at all.",
            "No matter where I am or what i do, GWTW is the most amazing book I have read since The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Ms Mitchell is an artist painting for us what Tara and Atlanta are like. She sculpts for us the flavors of the characters and has a certain way of stimulating all of your senses at once. You can taste, see, hear, smell, and almost feel the world that has been created. Not many authors successfully pull this off here in this world of TV and Movies where it is all right there for you and you don't actually have to think about it.",
            "I loved this book! I've read it like three times. I always recommend it to people. When you read this book it takes you back to the time and for a moment you wish you were there.",
            "I was forced to read this book by my mother when I was in Seventh Grade. She said it was the best book that she had ever read, so I decided to try it. I started to read the book, thinking that I would hate it. But as the story line progressed, it grew on me more and more. I was enthralled with the strength and courage that Scarlett had. This book was way better than I thought it would be. But the ending, which made me cry, dissapointed me. And I threw a fit because I read such a long story with such a horrible ending. But I now realize that I was just too young to read this book in 7th grade. I'm in 8th grade now and maybe sometime soon I'll read it again and understand it better. After you read this book the story will stay in your mind forever. My favorite character, strangely enough, was Rene Picard.",
            "I started to read the story a month before its realease to the theaters on june 26 (my birhtday)and I just fell in love with scarlett and the story being 15 now.I just finished it 2 days ago and that must be the best book I have ever read I think i'll read it again in the future,I would defenitly recomend it to anyone.",
            "Having seen the movie more times than I can count, I decided to read the book. I can only say that the book was not a disappointment. Scarlett O'Hara is the kind of character that you hate one minute and love the next. I was inspired by her determination to survive, but shocked at the schemes she came up with. While the book may be rather long, you won't be able to put it down once you start it.",
            "GWTW is, by far, the greatest romantic piece of historical literature ever published. It takes into account the psychological drama of an egotistical teenage girl coming of age as her world falls apart. Scarlett is portrayed with many imperfections (just as we all have), but in the end she sees the error of her ways. It is an American classic because of its representation of our societies obssession with self, and I believe everyone can see at least a piece of themselves in her, which is what makes the story so compelling. I read it for the first time at the age of 13, and 12 years later it continues to stand as the greatest novel ever written in my mind. I recommend it to anyone interested in analyzing a seemingly bad character and finding the reason behind their actions.",
            "Gone with the Wind was truly the best novel I have ever read and by far my favorite. Margaret Mitchell described every little detail so one could see it vividly, even if it was only in one's imagination. The characters were very much like real people and that is something not all author's are able to accomplish. The sequel, although it was a good effort, could not compare to the original. I think Gone with the Wind is a novel that everyone should read. If you haven't already read GWTW, then you don't know what you are missing. :-) :-)",
            "This book is incredible in every way! When I read it the first time, I became obsessed and was transported back to that era. I thought about it so much that even now, over 3 years later, when I read any part of it, I feels so familiar, a little like coming home. As large as the novel is, you won't regret a single moment you spend reading it. I recomend Gone with the Wind to anyone, especially anyone who loves to be transported to another time and place!",
            "Every time I read this novel, it makes me stop and think how there could be so few genuinley talented people on this earth, with someone like Ms. Mitchell to set such a fine example. Her ability to make the characters jump out from the pages is astounding. Her description of raw, human emotion move Scarlett from haughty, capricious and naive, to indignant, through livid and past loquaciously melancholy. This novel is unforgettably and extraodinarily real, penetrating, and poignant. And as for the sequel, A.R.'s 'Scarlett', I think it was great. Obviously not as good as the original, but the effort was recognized and well noted. (I hope that doesn't in any way sound patronizing). I recommend both novels to all ages, and regardless of what type of books you usually like to read. Guaranteed, you will love it!",
            "I am thirteen, and have just graduated 7th grade. I have read Gone with the Wind twice in the past year. I do believe it is the best novel I have read or ever will read. The first time I read Gone with the Wind, it took me four days to read. (the complete unabridged version). I did not spend all day reading it because I was in Kyoto, Japan siteseeing. The second time I was in school and had homework and other things to do so it took me a week to read it again. I also have read Scarlett it also was very good, but not as good as the original. If you haven't read it yet give Gone with the Wind a try!",
            "When i was reading this book, i thought about it and its characters day and night. I even dreamt about them! Thats how good it is! While reading it, it seems as if you are transported to that era and the characters are there in front of you. It is an immortal novel and people of all ages will continue enjoying it. Even those like me, who are not Americans will enjoy it because it is a novel for all nations. Every nation passes through a revolution or massive change atleast once in its history which turns the structure of its society upside down as shown in this novel. All the emotions portrayed so beautifully in this novel like love, hate, determination, a will to fight and struggle are universal. Without any doubt, this novel is the best that i've ever read.",
            "I first watched the movie when I'm 14. Just totally obsessed by it and started to read the novel. I'm now 17 and had read the novel 3 times in Chinese and one time in English and watched the movie for 5 times. It is (will be) the best novel I had read... the novel is better than the movie, more better. Dont' read or watch the sequel!! You will disappointed. Scarlet and Rhett only live in Gone With The Wind. When it ask &quot; How do you rate this book?&quot; in this review. I just can't stop laughing. Can it be rated by stars?",
            "Margret Mitchell uses wonderful descriptions to show a way of life that has long disappeared from time. The characters are fantastic and the conflicts in the book are numerous: Scarlett's love for Ashley, Rhett's love for Scarlett, the plight to salvage a lost cause. I saw the book as more than a love story. It shows the many emotions people go through as they mature and change with the world they are presented with. Gone With the Wind should be a required book for anyone who enjoys this genre. The movie is also good, but it doesn't include everything the book has to offer. I laughed and cried, and even though it's long (around 1,000 pages), I loved every moment, and wished it were longer. (It got really good at the end and then it ended)",
            "I could go on and on about how good the book is like everyone else does. I am not it is without a doubt the best novel ever. even if you do not like the Civil War the love story sweeps you for decades and decades to come",
            "GWTW has been my favorite book for a very long time. I just turned fourteen and I read it in fifth grade. For as long as I could remember, my sister had been talking about this book and how it had altered her opinion on classic literature. So, in fifth grade, i saw the movie, adored it got a hold of the book and read it to the very end. Even now, my parents remark about my &quot;Gone With the Wind Period&quot; when I thought of nothing but GWTW and read everything I could on the subject. I ordered cards, I got the script to the movie, I even read the biographys, letters and pictures of Margaret Mitchell. It's a awsome movie, a brilliant novel, and, to sum things up, probably the most influential book/movie of my childhood, it helped make me into the person I am today.---Cynthia Christina Vanci",
            "I am only twelve years old, and most people my age aren't at all interested in love stories. I am always interested in a good book, and most of my picks are action or mystery. I have read hundreds of books in my life so far, some of them poorly written, some of them average, but many of them incredible. These books have captured my imagination, but Gone With the Wind took my soul. I almost made a new lake out of my tears when Melanie died. And I loved Mammy! She added some of the funniest parts to a book I have ever had the honor to read. I am still wondering how she'll ever get Rhett back after what happened. I haven't read the sequal yet but I intend to do so. In fact, I am trying to order it from Amazon.com as soon as possible. I don't care if dozens of people didn't like the sequal. I HAVE GOT TO KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT IN THE STORY! That's also one of GWTW's strong points. Most people won't read more than the first chapter, but if you decide to go the extra mile (or two) you will find yourself dodging bullets in Sherman's seige of Atlanta. If there is one weakness to it, it's in the movie itself. It followed closely to the story line, but strangely the guys making it forgot about little Wade and Ella, and almost forgot Will entirely. But even worse, they got Mr. O'hara's death completely mixed up. And some of the guys that they got to play the beaux didn't know the first thing about acting. Charles Hamilton may have been an idiot, but surely he wasn't that dumb! Sorry, I'm getting to into the movie (I just finished watching it for the first time today). Still, despite the movie's sad mistakes, Gone With the Wind has swept this twelve year old boy off is feet and into the civil war in Atlanta! This isn't a rental book. This is a buying book",
            "Being raised in the south myself, I feel a kinship to Scarlett O'Hara. Margaret Mitchell's book has keep me captivated since I was a child. GWTW was one of the first book reports I gave in jr. high school. The teacher couldn't believe that someone of my age could have read such a book. Although it took close to a week to read it, GWTW has stayed in my mind and heart in all the years that have followed. No book has made the impression that this one has made on me. I don't believe there is one that could. The first copy of this book I ever got has long since had the ink rubbed from its pages. It was well worth the time that is takes to read it. It is TRULY a classic",
            "I have read this many times, and love it better every time. Rhett Butler was my first love ever, thanks to Margaret Mitchell. I still have a little crush on him. She made the characters so real that I feel like I grew up knowing them as my friends",
            "How do you rate a work of art? By the amount of people who have fallen under its spell? Or by the amount of hours one spends reading it, and then reviewing it? Gone with the wind has already been rated a ten, and its flame has not diminished an iota. I am fifteen, and I have yet to read a book which portrays civil war, and love, as well as Margaret Mitchell does in Gone with the Wind. I am fifteen, and I have yet to love a heroine as much as I love Scarlett O' Hara. Melanie is good, but Scarlett is alive! Her spirit and unflagging determination awakens in all of us the right to survive. We all need reminders of the horrors of war, and of the fact that while mostly the men go off to war, it is the woman who has to stay home and somehow make do with only the bare essentials of life, and hope...........................I recommend everyone to read this book, it is the best!",
            "Gone with the Wind was the fisrt 'adult' book I'd ever read as a child .Took me awhile to get thru it but I'v read it many times since then. It was MY daughters first 'adult' book and has become her favorite also. I hope that my grandaughter also loves this book when she comes to be",
            "Margaret Michell's GONE WITH THE WIND is a tragic saga that can never be forgotten once read. Scarlett O'Hara is headstrong, intelligent, bold, and beautiful but she also makes mistakes. She is selfish and lives for the present. Rett Buttler is one man no woman can ever forget. He is the perfect father and lover whom is first consumed wholly with Scarlett and then driven away by her. Scarlett's frivolousness will be turned over and over in your mind. If you want to read a truely absorbing, romantic, historically accurate book let this one be your first choice",
            "It takes you through the story of a girl that has everything and wants just what she can't have, and through the story of how her world fell around her. About Scarlett and her men, but never having her one love",
            "Gone with the Wind's anti-hero is captivating and complex. Scarlett is complex in her own mind, tormented about what she wants vs what's right to do, while she fights to survive during and after the Civil War. She is selfish and aware of it. Adding to the complexity of Scarlett, is her kindness that she affords others despite her selfish desire. While she is the daughter of a slave holder, she remains loyal to caring for her former slaves after the war and has a developed relationship with Mammy. Unfortunately, the social thread of America, and much of the world from Bible days going forward, thought nothing wrong of owning slaves. However, that social paradigm shifts as the story continues. Scarlett might be from a wealthy family, but she is still a female that bucks societal trends and owns and operates business. On occasion she is outright ruthless with men. In the end of the book she is \"punished\" for her misdeeds. However, her husband is not.It surprises me that many people compare GWTW to Birth of a Nation. The problem is we are viewing GWTW as if it can be held to today's value system. It does not. It cannot. It's not a book about human unity or human dignity. It's a book about surviving crisis and how some American's got through a war that killed 12% of the US population. In the 1920s and 30s the KKK was very strong in the South and perpetuated stories about black attacks on whites and many political groups argued that blacks were not fit for society. Using genteel approaches GWTW presents strong women who helped the south survive the war, it also showed blacks as \"southerners\" and caring people (Scarlett's life is saved at least twice by a black character in the book), it also suggests that war is not a wise solution. Scarlett gets away with voicing unpopular opinions \"war is a waste of time\", \"the south should just free the slaves\", \"why should women always stay quiet around men?\" because she's portrayed as an anti-hero. If she were a do-gooder she might come off differently. Pretend she had Melanie's \"kind nature\" combined with her practical and self serving criticism of \"states rights, sexism, & war\", she would be seen by many readers in the 1930s as almost being an abolitionist sympathizer. The book would have failed at that point in delivering it's message about survival. The message would be lost. Furthermore, it wouldn't express what many southerners already felt, a kinship and love of the land. When you read the last paragraph of the book you get a picture of what prevails in the south, the love of the earth, southern life, quiet country evenings and the simple relationship of Scarlett and Mammy (the only person she has left: her father and mother died, her friend Melanie died, daughter died and her husband left). Scarlett also realizes too late that she is in love with Rhett and losses him, just as the South realized too late that \"states rights\" cost them what they loved the most.",
            "I read it for the 1st time at 13 and have read about once every 1 to 2 years since. I have seen the movie countless times as well. Nothing cures depression like &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. When we lost Margaret Mitchell we lost so much.",
            "I AM 12 YEARS OLD BUT I READ THE BOOK WHEN I WAS 11 LAST OCTOBER. THE BOOK LTERALLY SWEPT ME OFF MY FEET! I READ THE SEQUL AS SOON AS I COULD AFTERWARDS.

            "I am torn. Half of the time I love the intricate characters and the relatonships between them and how it is all so skillfully braided together by a master wordsmith. I have trouble believig it was her first published one. A few flaws like too much obvious foreshadowing of one or two events but truly literature. Half the time I feel like shaking the chracters and the author for the blind racism that was breathed in like the air. That is why I gave this nook only four stars. Yet I would recommend including it in reading for college age or above as and example of these attitudes but accompanied by works of African American author covering the same historical period.",
            "Epic about the Civil War and Reconstruction and a southern belle named Scarlett O'Hara. She goes through three marriages, children, murder and incredible hardships but pulls through. A lot of people don't know this but it won a Pulitzer Pize for fiction in 1937. Everybody knows about the movie that came out in 1939 and is now a classic.I'm not a fan of romance novels OR historical fiction but I LOVE this book. It shows truthfully (I heard) what the South was like before and after the war. It explains the rites and passages of that era...but never in a boring or leaden manner. Author Margaret Mitchell does it in a matter of fact manner that makes it easily accessible. She makes the characters seem like real people (even though Melanie is a little bit TOO saint-like) and draws you into their troubles and worries. Also I've seen the movie at least nine times and this compares favorably to it. There are some significant changes--Scarlett is 16 in the book, she has THREE children and is desribed as not being pretty (which Vivien Leigh certainly was in the movie), but they're minor. In fact the book helps explain some things that were left out of the movie and clarifies some of the actions of certain characters. But, even on its own, it's a GREAT book. VERY long but never dull. A classic. Pick this one up. Ignore the dreadful sequel \"Scarlett\".",
            "After finishing Margaret Mitchell's first and only novel, the one that landed her a Pulitzer Prize and was adapted into a film that is considered one of the best movies of all time, I felt what was to be expected: completely exhausted. Obviously a book this size cannot be completed in one sitting, and (since I was determined not to rush it) it took me the better part of two weeks to get through it; two weeks to struggle through the American Civil War and its aftermaths, not to mention the tempestuous relationship between four larger-than-life individuals: Melanie Hamilton, Rhett Butler, Ashley Wilkes and the infamous Scarlett O'Hara.Of course, I use the word \"struggle\" in a good way, as this is a book that sucks you up into the trials and tribulations of the time, and spits you out the other side. By its end, I was completely drained, something that no book has left me sinceTess of the D'ubervilles: 2500 Headwords (Oxford Bookworms Library).Scarlett O'Hara is a young Southern belle, one of the most popular debutantes in her community. Although she has power over almost every single young man she knows, one continues to elude her. She has loved Ashley Wilkes since she was fourteen years old, and reacts badly when she hears that he is to be married to Melanie Wilkes - a timid young woman that Scarlett despises.After loosing her temper with Ashley (after her declarations of love to him are not reciprocated, despite an admission that he *does* care for her), she is humiliated to find that their encounter was secretly witnessed by the amoral Captain Rhett Butler, a man with a bad reputation who seems oddly amused at Scarlett's conduct. Furious at both men and incapable of understanding either, Scarlett is barely of aware of the political tensions rising around her.Yet Scarlett is about to be swept up in a conflict far beyond the confines of her heart: the Confederacy and the Yankees have declared war, and her entire world is thrown into chaos. Life is whittled down to its most basic elements: hunger, death, love, birth, morals and - paramount to this particular story - survival. In particular, a question that arises during the story is (particularly in relation to Scarlett), what is survival worth?In creating Scarlett, Mitchell has created one of the most intriguing literary figures of all time. Spoilt, selfish, practical, driven, determined, passionate and often unforgivably short-sighted, Scarlett is an individual whose desire for comfort and security gradually erode away at any sense of right and wrong, her development as a complete individual, and her even personal dignity. Just as Macbeth had his ambition and Othello had his jealously, Scarlett's fatal flaw is her inability to *understand*.She does not understand any of the three most important people in her life (Melanie, Ashley and Rhett), she does not understand her own people or what drives them (she is frustrated at their blind ability to the Cause), and she does not understand the sacrifices that must be made in order for her to find contentment...that is, she does not understand until it is too late.This is character study at its most nuanced, for Scarlett is totally believable and understandable, even when she's doing morally reprehensible things. At the beginning of the novel, her faults are somewhat amusing - the fact that she hates the war mostly because it deprives her of the luxury that she loves, and that she loves Ashley even though she finds him unfathomable.Later though, it takes on a more tragic air, as inner peace continues to elude her and we gradually discover the loneliness that comes with total self-interest. It's beautiful, haunting, heart-rending stuff.However, as it seems with every famous book, there is some controversy and it largely concerns Mitchell's treatment of the pre-war South. Mitchell would love to have us believe that the pre-war South was a golden age of chivalrous landowners that treated their ladies like jewels and their slaves like children. When their society is swept away by the winds of war, we are meant to feel grief, as though a living thing has been snuffed out and its memory slowly dying in the remnants of the people who are left to linger on. Ultimately the book is what it is, and I would certainly still recommend it despite some of its dated and overly-romantic views of the South.I actually watched the movie before reading the novel (it was want wanted me to get hold of the book), and I must say that the two go hand in hand. After reading the book I realized how spot-on the choices in casting the movie were, and it was interesting to see what elements of the book the screenwriters decided to cut; semi-important characters like Will Benteen and Archie, and events like the Yankees raiding Tara and circumstances surrounding Gerald's death. Most surprising in the book was the fact that Scarlett actually had three children, one to each of her husbands. The movie kept only Bonnie, and to be honest, I could understand why this decision was made, considering Wade and Ella have very little to do in the story, and are largely ignored, by the author as well as their mother.Ultimately, the driving force in the book is not the attention to historical detail, the clear and vivid prose, or the weight of grandeur and importance that lies on every page; it is the complex and fascinating relationship between the four major characters: the angelic Melanie, the noble Ashley, the rakish Rhett and the driven Scarlett - and I don't just mean how Scarlett relates to each of them. Just as intriguing is Rhett's admiration and protectiveness toward Melanie, Melanie's blind devotion to Scarlett, and the fact that Rhett and Ashley are uncannily similar in thought, though not deed. The quartet makes up one of the most tangled and intriguing set of relationships ever put to paper, and that alone is worth the time it will take to read \"Gone with the Wind\".",
            "Atlanta, Georgia- No other book has defined the south more than Gone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell. Growing up in the south, I deemed it was time to sit down and read this classic which is in celebrating seventy five years in print.In the 75th Anniversary addition, Pat Conroy write a preface where he chronicles how this book was a bond between he and his mother as she would read it to him and how it profoundly influenced his writings.With over a 900 pages, it is a brick of a book but it does masterfully captures the consequences of what we refer in the south as \"the war of northern aggression\".The principle character Scarlett evolves from a young women ready to be conquered by a wide array of suitors. Her love Ashley has been wooed away and she spends a lifetime trying to pave her way. The allusive Rhett Butler fails to conquer this steel magnolia who always keeps hope alive by reiterating that tomorrow is a new day.Gone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell takes you to the allure of the gentile world of the south. This book should be savored by any book lover once in their reading odyssey.",

            "GWTW is, hands down, the greatest American novel. In my opinion, it is the greatest novel ever written. When I first read GWTW, I couldn't wait to get to the parts about Scarlett and Rhett. Now, though I still love the interplay between them, I read it for the incredible detail to history. Margaret Mitchell grew up sitting on the knees of old confederate soldiers while they reminisced about the war, then took that treasure and masterfully provided a moving account of the war and it's aftermath through the eyes of Scarlett O'Hara. The wonderful thing is that she is able to give this history lesson all wrapped up in the greatest love story of all times! All the characters are memorable - Mammy, Gerald O'Hara, Ashley, Melanie, not to mention the near-perfect man, Rhett Butler! And then there is Scarlett... While many people who have only seen the movie don't like Scarlett, no one who reads the book can help but admire her sheer determination to overcome the tragedy of the war and rebuild her life. At the same time, it is heart wrenching to see her throwing away the love of her true soul mate and ruining her life because of the fears the war sprouted in her. I admire Scarlett on many levels, and think she is the most vivid heroine in literature because of her failings and her strength. If you could capture Scarlett's fire and Melanie's kindness and roll them into one woman, she could rule the world and be adored by all. If you want a book that will grab your heart and capture your emotions, you must read Gone With The Wind!",

            "At times the book vvas tedious and i had the urge to skip pages, vvhich i did. i felt that at parts she dragged the story out too much; parts vvhere she used a page or tvvo to describe vvhat the day looked like or vvhat furnishings vvere contained in a room; these vveren't necessary. i like to knovv the setting of the story, but a vvhole page dedicated to descriptions? hmm...Despite this i really enjoyed the story. it offered a different point of vievv of the civil vvar. the pros and cons of slavery. it vvas interesting. i found that i liked the characters: scarlett and rhett..*smiles* they vvere memorable. very endearing characters.It vvas a romance story that rather sticks in my mind. the story vvas about scarlett and her life..yeha it sounds boring and at times it vvas but...read it. you might like it. just give it a try (read the vvhole book) and then decide if u like it or not. but don't read the story if the only reason is because someone or you yourself forced you to read it. u'll probably hate it if u do.Someday vvhen i've forgotten most of the details of the book i might reread it, but for novv i'll go back to my vampire chronicles.enjoy",
            "I agree with many reviewers that the book is an interesting, engrossing novel. The character development and descriptions are very good, and Mitchell does a good job of describing the motives that drive the characters. I also appreciated the fact that Mitchell did not write a typical &quot;happily ever after&quot; ending. However, I find it disturbing that very few reviewers noticed or commented on the extreme racism in the book. If you believe Mitchell's description of the KKK, you would never know that this was a racist, terrorist organization (and still is). Also, according to Mitchell, only &quot;trashy&quot; black people wanted freedom; the &quot;quality&quot; black people wanted to remain slaves!! These are obviously Mitchell's views of black people, and not just the characters' views. Mitchell took pains to write that not all Yankees were bad and that many were ashamed of the corrupt reconstructionist government they had to uphold. In a biography of Mitchell's life, she is described as refusing to attend a class with a black student who has been admitted to her college. I only hope that most readers noted her obviously racist views and realize that slavery was not as she described it.",
            "Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind is the most remembered Civil War love story of our time. The story of Scarlett O' Hara begins on her father's Georgia plantation, Tara. She was raised as a southern woman should be only the War turns her life upside down when she is forced to marry one man after another in order to keep her beloved Tara. Of course none of these men were her true love, which is Ashley Wilkes who is married to a women whom Scarlett cannot stand. Rhett Butler is a man who is disgraced by his family and most of Georgia for his ungentlemanly deeds. Rhett is captivated by Scarlett's strong will and is determined to make her love him. Scarlett has been through death and starvation and only focuses on never letting anything else ruin her already tarnished life. Scarlett's blind love for Ashley prevents Scarlett from seeing Rhett's love for her. In the end, Scarlett finally recognizes whom she truly loves but it might be too late.",
            "at first when i saw how thick GWTW was, I felt like i couldn't finish it. But, by watching the movie, I wanted to read the book. I have nothing bad to say about this book. It's amazing and a person can connect with one of the character immediatly. Scarlett is the one, who is vain, and likes to get her way with everything. Rhett is a great guy... just that his love dies out for Scarlett in the end. the funniest character i consider to be is Mammy. A book that should be in everyone's library.",
            "Scarlett O'Hara is born to an Irish father and Southern belle mother in 1840's Georgia. Pampered all her life, Scarlett pursues the love of Ashley Wilkes, only to be rebuffed. Wounded, she seeks to hurt him by marrying his fiance's brother, Charles Hamilton. When Charles dies in a military camp, Scarlett moves to Atlanta to live with Ashley's wife, Melanie, who doesn't know that Scarlett loves her husband.Rhett Butler, a dashing scoundrel, meets Scarlett for the first time just as she has revealed her love for Ashley. Knowing that a 'true lady' would never have done such a thing, Rhett recognizes the scoundrel in Scarlett and is immediately attracted to her. Throughout his exploits as a blockade runner, he pursues Scarlett while she pines fruitlessly for Ashley.Set against the swirling backdrop of the Civil War, Gone With the Wind is meticulously researched and exceedingly well written. Descriptions of upper class, white, Southern life are fascinating, and the plot is, of course, wildly compelling. Will Ashley leave his wife for Scarlett? Will Rhett reveal his love for Scarlett? Will Scarlett return Rhett's love? How do they survive the great toll the Civil War takes on their lives? A classic page-turner.",
            "\"Gone with the Wind\" - Book ReviewThis is a story of love, of loss, and of courage. Margaret Mitchell created an amazing story, romance saga of love and the most sentimental portrait of the Civil War. \"Gone with the Wind\" in my opinion is deserving of a five-star rating, because it is by far the greatest story ever written. Mitchell's \"Gone with the Wind\" is the story of Scarlett O'Hara, a spoiled southern beautiful woman, whose life is suddenly caught up in the turmoil of the American Civil War. Through her fights during the war and the six years of Reconstruction that follow, author showed her life pass through three husbands and three children. Within this background, we observe Scarlett's conflict against external and internal conflicts, her losses, gains, and hopes. Author described bright vivid characters and relationship between people, but she did not attach great importance to some problem, such as slavery; the book is very interesting and I certainly would recommend it to just about anyone.\"Gone with the Wind\" by Margaret Mitchell is a war novel, a historical romance, a comedy of manners, a bitter lamentation, a cry of the heart, and a long, cold-hearted look at the character of this one lovely woman. It is undoubtedly the classic novel of Civil War. The major characteristic that enables it to achieve its seriousness also criticizes Scarlett O'Hara to a life of unrequited love and dooms her potential for happiness with Rhett Butler. Mitchell created the character, Scarlett, wonderfully. She had spunk, determination, intelligence, and selfishness-traits that made her personality interesting. If Scarlett needs something bad enough, she will not hesitate to throw away proper social conduct or her own personal goals. She does what ever she needs to get her by. Then there is Rhett. He is this attractive man who is no gentleman. He brought a little bit of light into the dark parts of the book. He seems to be just a rude, ill-behaved man at first, but later his character is deep and full of emotion and feelings. Margaret Mitchell created a bond and passion between these two characters. It was a wonderful romance, with love and anger-a sort of bittersweet romance. Although Scarlett is a strong and independent woman, most people can relate to her because she makes mistakes like a normal human. This book examines different types of strength. Whether it is Mammy's honorable courage and dignity, or Rhett's keen level-headedness, or Melanie's Christian devotion to people, each person has his or her own root from which they draw their strength.The perspective is strength because it permits the author to vividly portray the destruction of Southern society better than any battlefield-centered novel could. Unfortunately, it also leaves the author, and therefore Scarlet as well, incapable of understanding the male characters. They are merely personalities that fade in-and-out of the background to shape the narrative. While they are characters that can stand up off the page and cast a shadow, there is no tone or timbre in their images. Some author's descriptions of the reconstruction are degraded. For example, blacks were only happy being slaves. Big Sam says he had enough of freedom and wants to go back to Tara. He even states doubtfully that while in the north whites wanted him to sit at the table like he was their equal, but he could not do it because he is not the equal to whites. At one point Mitchell is describing how the southern whites hate the Yankees so much because the Yankees have money and food and power and they do not, yet she does not have any sense of irony to see that the whites are in the position that they put the slaves in for centuries.If someone loves historical fiction with a little romance, this book is perfect for their. The writing is superb, and the plot is dramatic and sad, but it includes enough of Scarlett's triumphs of strength that sets it apart from all other books. Scarlett O'Hara is the perfect Southern belle who is incredible to read about. How she attracts men with her charm and little helpless acts is unbelievable. She is used to having slaves serve her and she treats them with little or no respect until she needs them. One cannot stop thinking about how much they would hate Scarlet if she was real, but they are not able to stop feeling sorry for her and they want to help her to realize how stupid she is. This is a must read for any person who loves classic literature.\"Gone with the Wind\" is really one of the world's most well written romance novels. Set in the backdrop of the American Civil War in the eighteen century, it tells the story of the people who fought for survival during the War and the Reconstruction Period through sheer shrewd wits and cunning business methods. Margaret Mitchell is an absolute talent. She was nowhere close to the cheap romance writer many had portrayed her to be- she was a realist. She was actually writing about how human spirit and determination, how it can be applied to help one over such obstacles. Mitchell's book broke sales records. Within a year of publication, 1,383,000 copies had been sold. Today, sales stand at over 21,000,000. In 1937 \"Gone with the Wind\" was awarded the Pulitzer Prize.",
            "This is the first phrase in the book to describe the spoiled Scarlett O' Hara, who was made immoral by Viven Leigh in the movie verison of ' Gone with the Wind' ( 1939 ). The book is 1024 pages, which is long, but the book is so good, you wouldn't even realize how many pages there are, and you'll be asking for more.The story is about a spoiled Southern Belle named Scarlett O' Hara, who lives in Georgia on her family Plantion, and basically lives the life of a southern belle of her time ( mid-1800's ). Scarlett gets anything she wants, all she has to do is bat her eyelashes. But the one man she wants, Ashley Hamiltion, she can't give. No matter how hard she trys, she just can't get him, and to make matters worst. He's marrying the mousy-type Melanie. Scarlett than goes through the rest of the book, trying to get Ashley through revenge and through her love. Along the way, she meets the handsome Rhett Butler, the man who truly wants to be the only one for Scarlett, but knows he never can.If your fan of the movie ( like I am before I read the book ), then you would notice BIG differences between the two. But the book describes each character perfectly, Scarlett is even more interesting to read about. For movie fans, hearing Scarlett's thoughts is even more of a treat. I'll recommend this book to ANYONE.",
            "Margaret Mitchell was born in Atlanta in November 1900. When she was around thirteen, her family, affluent but not wealthy, moved into a big house on Peachtree Street, one of the principal settings for Gone with the Wind, which she began writing in 1926. The Macmillan Company published Gone with the Wind in May 1936; it won the Pulitzer Prize in 1937. The movie, which won ten Academy Awards, premiered in Atlantic City on December 15, 1939.I read the &#65533;Special Commemorative 60th-Anniversary Edition&#65533; (paperback) purchased from Amazon.com in February 2003, which commemorates the film, not the book. The back cover of that edition quotes the Washington Post claiming it&#65533;s &#65533;The greatest love story of our time, the story of Scarlett O&#65533;Hara and Rhett Butler&#65533;.&#65533; I suspect the person who wrote that saw the movie, but did not read the book. If it&#65533;s the love story that interests you, I suggest you buy the video. If you want to understand the origins of the South&#65533;s point of view though, at least the upper middle class Georgian point of view, then read this book.I was raised in Connecticut and have been often perplexed by the notions of some of my Southern white peers, puzzled for example by the intractable bigotry of intelligent people who are unwilling to understand that they ought to know better. Conversely, I&#65533;ve admired the generous, unselfish, seemingly pointless hospitality given me by a Southern adversary, a rival, so incongruent that it smacked of hypocrisy. Having read Gone with the Wind, I&#65533;m less perplexed and puzzled now. These people were bred on deep roots.Margaret Mitchell fashioned her novel from stories about slavery, the Civil War, reconstruction and abolition told by those who had survived those dramatic events. The people who lived through those terrible times, or their children, told those stories. From these tales, Margaret Mitchell painted a broad panorama of a culture in forced transformation: The brutal and reprehensible conduct of the Yankees, the greed of the carpetbaggers, the noble origins of the KKK, and the corruption of the North&#65533;s reconstruction. It is Southern noblesse telling the story of their decline. Margaret Mitchell is their apologist.The paperback version I read has 1024 pages of small type with narrow margins. Mitchell&#65533;s writing is sometimes exciting, but often it&#65533;s tedious. Descriptions tend to be excessive, and dialogue is often more like monologue. This style may have been fashionable fifty years ago, but I&#65533;ll deduct a star for it today.",
            "WOW~ There is barely enough words to describe how great it is, so I say, Thank You Margret Mitchell, for such a wonderful book. To say the least, I've read so much romance that I can literally guess what happens at the end of each novel (and Jane Austen counts) but this one is just fantastic. However I only gave it four stars because of1)how many man Scarlett has married-Charles, Frank, Rhett~2)I cannot give it four and a half starsI must say thought, to those who love this book, steer clear away from the supposed sequel: \"Scarlett: The Sequel to Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind\" or \"Rhett Butler's People\" It is just a horror to see such a great book have such a terrible sequel for an ending.Anyways, for those who have not yet read this book, HAPPY READING!",
            "Gone With The Wind the American classic is a story of love and war in the 1860's. The main character Scarlett O'Hara was a bold women who fought the hardships of the war and also putting up with the man who infuriated her the most Rhett Butler. Rhett Butler was a rich man from Charleston who fell in love with Scarlett during the war. He also had a opinion about everything which Scarlett hated because she was very hot tempered. An incident in the book that made Scarlett my favorite character and also why I like the book so much was when Rhett Butler left her, Mammy and Melanie in the middle of the road when they were going back to Tara from Atlanta.The reason I liked this part so much was she didn't give up and she told Rhett how she felt and how she hated him for doing that. In those days girls really couldn't say their opinions but she did it any ways and showed she was strong . She was very determind to get what she wanted and she did. I really liked this book for many reasons. It gave you a description of how the war really was and it made you realize what they went through when they fought the war. Another reason I liked the book was the characters. Scarlett was a good example because she was a very lively character.Also Rhett Butler he was very good because he was very mysterious and you never knew what he would do next. I would recommend this book to people of all ages. The reason i think this is because it is a great love story and it gives you a understanding of how the war was really . I would defitnetly read this book again.",
            "Me being 11yrs. old didn't think that I would like this book. Boy was I wrong. This is my favorite book of all time! The only thing that I didn't like about the book which I know almost everybody will agree with me on is that it ends so suddenly not even giving you a hint to the outcome. Margaret Mitchell is so good that she can even capture an eleven yr. olds mind with an adult book. This book is easy to put people you know in the characters spots and just sit there all day and daydream a new ending. Did I mention that I loved this book?",
            "If you think you know what this book is about because you've seen the movie then think again. Each time I have read it I discover something new. So many richly complex characters and scenes were left out of the film due to time constraints. It is my favorite book of all time, one of those rare works of literature that you can open up to any page and immediately become engrossed in.",
            "This book was advertised as large print which is what my elderly mother needed. It arrived and it was not large print but normal print. The company apologized and stated they did not have a large print but to keep the book they sent.",
            "This is the best book of all time it is a love story and a story about survival. Scarlett is both a villain and heroine",
            "This is a great book! I love it. You should read it. It took me one year to finish it.",
            "The hard cover book - it's actual cover was really disappointingly plain and as it was a present, I felt let down to give such a plain gift. The book itself is a classic and I am sure my daughter will enjoy reading it.",
            "This item I received in prestine condition. It is a rare version of the book in the first place (and antique), so that's very impressive. The shipping time was very fast as well, and there was even a cordial note inside the book thanking me for my purchase and with added information. Very pleased!",
            "I honestly purchased the kindle edition Of this book by mistake, but decided to give it a go. I'm so glad I did! What a wonderful historical drama. The characters created and the setting during the social and political upheaval of the us civil war makes this book a must read for anyone into historical novels true or not.",
            "\"Gone with the Wind\" by Margaret Mitchell is an important work of literature set in the times of the American Civil War. It is a long book, but I read it quickly. Everytime the story started to slow down, something big happened which brought the momentum back.I would like to warn potential readers however that this not a book to read if you want to sit back and have a relaxing read. The book has a story that is very tumultuous and at times sad. This book is one of the most dramatic books I have read.The book follows the life of a 16 year-old girl in Confederate Georgia called Scarlett O'hara. She is attractive both physically and in the manner in which she acts. I had a huge crush on her when I was reading the book. She wants desperately to marry a young man called Ashley Wilkes who is engaged to a nice girl called Melanie.The book has a number of characters that appear in it also. The most noteworthy is Rhett Butler. Rhett Butler is a speculator who becomes a hero in Georgia for bringing supplies and goods to it through the Union blockade. Although people are grateful to him for bringing in supplies and goods, some have issues with his lack of moral convictions. His character is so macho, he is too macho. To me he seemed like a monster. At the beginning of the book Scarlett has a low opinion of him and I thought that was understandable. I'm a guy, so I don't know what exactly women would think of him, but I suspect that some women might be turned on by his predatory nature viewing him as extremely masculine.Although Scarlett is more physically attractive than Melanie, the girl Ashley Wilkes is engaged to, I actually thought that Melanie was more romantic than the mean-spirited Scarlett O'hara. At times I really felt bad for Melanie who wasn't loved enough by Ashley.\"Gone with the Wind\" takes place during the Civil War and fortunately it doesn't romanticize it. The book makes it clear that many soldiers were coming home maimed or crippled. The book shows that the Civil War was a gruesome conflict.From reading about Scarlett O'hara in \"Gone with the Wind\" I feel that I got a real insight into how women like her think. I now know that such women are not entirely noble although they may claim to be.",

            "I loved Gone with the Wind! It is such a good book. I'm 13, and I read GWTW in about 4 days. It is by far one of the best books I have ever read. If you don't read this GWTW, you will be missing something great.",

            "I first read this book and saw the movie 35 years ago as a young teenager. Seeing that it was the 75th anniversary of the book, I decided to pick it up again. I am so glad I did. I didn't remember much about the book or movie after all these years.Mitchell did a fantastic job of describing people and settings. The story is about romance, family, survival, loss and determination. The characters are presented as real people with both good and bad points. Scarlett is manipulative and selfish for the most part but also loyal to her family when times are hard. Melanie is ever so sweet and innocent but we also see she is smarter than she first appears. Ashley is book smart and brave on the battlefield but is stuck in following the rules of conduct he has been taught his whole life. Rhett can be selfish and mean but deep down he really cares about people.I have lived in Georgia all my life. I grew up near Macon, where Sherman's troops marched. My 7th grade Georgia History teacher was a huge Civil War buff and made sure we learned more than just what was in the classroom history book. We saw the places the troops fought, we heard the stories handed down through the generations of the war, we read newspaper articles from that time period. Most of us were descended from people who experienced the war in their backyard. Often historical novels have twisted facts to fit the story, but the historical and geographical details of this book are accurate.For the critics who say this book is racist, you need to understand it is based on one view point of the south at that time. Not all Southerners owned slaves, very few owned plantations the size of the fictional Tara. Many slaves were mistreated, and of course owning another person is wrong. Rich whites did look down on poor whites. Whites did look down on blacks. But that is what happened at the time. The book isn't glorifying racism. It is just describing how a rich white family saw things during the 1860's in Georgia.Also, many of the men fighting were not slave owners but were just trying to protect their family. They did what most of us would do if we felt someone was coming to hurt and kill our families. Lincoln didn't set out to free the slaves. His main objective was to preserve the country as one entity.",
            "One of the best novels I've ever read. Margaret Mitchell has a way of bringing the reader into a tumulus period in the United States history. Near 1000 pages but easy to read and informative to what Southerners went through. Should be required reading in high schools of the U.S.",
            "Ever read a good book? My favorite book is Gone With the Wind. The Main characters are Scarlett O'Hara, Ashley Wilkes (BOY), and Melanie Hamilton. Since Scarlett is mensioned more often, we'll call her the mainest character. Scarlett is selfish, arrogant, hypocrative, and just down right mean!In this story, Scarlett is in love with Ashley. Ashley is to marry his cousin, Melly,( Sick right?), even though he loves Scarlett. Though Scarlett tries to make him jealous by marrying other men, Ashley stays loyal to his frail wife. Then, Scarlett, after 2 marriges that ended in the husband's death, comes upon a broad-backed, strong, handsome, rich, Charlestonian man. In the end, Scarlett ends up with her 3rd husband, leaving her with 2 children from previous marriges, one dead child, no friends, a large house, and oodles of money! Isn't this what she's wanted?Although this story is from evil Scarlett's point of view, it's still a wonderful story full of action, romance, sad and happy times, and hilarious scenes that don't quite seem to fit. Scarlett does the most hilarious things to get Ashley to notice her and he does many in return. I think that this book should be for 8th grade and up. If you're a boy you have to LOVE romance to like this and ladies don't need to be any personality or like any types of books, because there's things for all appeal.CAUTION: This book may lead to much dictionary research and much more study of the Civil War!",
            "This is a story about the life of a spoiled, selfish woman, Scarlett, going through the civil war period. It gives you an understanding of south's point of view. Several reviewers complained that it is racist. I would agree with those people but I don't like reading books that I agree with all the time. I found it valuable to try to understand what motivated the south to fight to preserve slavery. It seemed Mitchell was almost trying to defend slavery; if this offends and upsets you, then perhaps this may not be an enjoyable book for you.The character development is outstanding in this book. I constantly found myself comparing the book's characters with people I know. I've read many Michener books, which are also long historical fictions. I enjoy his books a lot, but this was far better than any of his books due primarily to her excellent character development.This book will stay with me forever.",
            "This will always be my all-time favourite book. The most sumptuous and vivd imagery. Such intriguing and authentic characters. And of course Scarlett is one of the most fascinating women in literary history precisely because she is so ahead of her time and dared to be different. I just love her though I certainly don't like her much!As much as I adore the movie as well, particularly the exquisite Vivien Leigh, it doesn't capture even half the richness of the novel.This is one book I re-read every few years and continue to find new elements to fascinate every time.",
            "I was out of non-fiction and had to settle for a novel, so why not the most famous of all? A smart move! I've read many historical accounts of the Civil War from many perspectives: The North, the South, the general, the private, the battle, the location, the time period,, and there is even one from the point of view of a horse! This is Scarlett O'Hara's view from her plantation, Tara, outside of Atlanta. What a refreshing perspective! The story is grand and Mitchell's graphic style keeps the images flashing onto every page. Yes, Scarlett is a bitch, but that just makes her all the more desirable. Yes, this is a \"girl's book,\" as was often pointed out to me, but guys can show their feminine side while reading of General Sherman laying waste to Georgia! A tip: See the movie first, it's a good introduction to the book. I read the book first and then saw the movie. The movie was so condensed that it almost seemed to run on fast-forward.",
            "I've seen the movie so many times I can recite it. But the book is so much better!! For lovers of the movie, you have to suck it up and take on 1024 pages of passion, despair, and the most amazing love story ever.I love Scarlett and yet at the same time I want to wring her neck. I wish I had Rhett Butler - I'd treat him right!! At the end of the book, just like the end of the movie, I ended up with tears running hopelessly down my cheeks.In addition to the adventures of a spirited young woman from Georgia, Scarlett also reveals much truth about the devastation witnessed in Georgia throughout the war and during the terrible years of Reconstruction.It's a gem to be treasured, and read over again.",
            "Margaret Mitchell presents characters whose depth is astonishing, and depictions of varied relationships that can reach the reader on numerous levels. This is not merely a love story or glorified version of a tragic historical period, but an intense treatment of much of the paradox in human nature.Regarding the racial issue - I would say that the depiction of blatant racism in this book is all the more powerful because everything is told from the Southern aristocrat's point of view. The characters need to believe, and have convinced themselves, that they are benevolent and affectionate towards their slaves! Yet they refer to these same people as &quot;apes&quot; without seeing their own horrifying stance. When Melanie, supposedly the soul of kindness, tells Ashley that, if they move North, they cannot let Beau attend school and &quot;have pickaninnies in his class,&quot; it shows the horror of racism just as clearly as if the reader had seen the miserable lot of the slaves.Scarlett, certainly no heroine and one with no principles who'd like merely the reputation for being a &quot;great lady,&quot; is a most intriguing character. As Margaret Mitchell makes clear in many references, we have here one who is incapable of being at all analytical. (Except for Rhett, and, to some extent, Gerald, only Mammy can see through Scarlett's facade.) The Ashley she loves is a creation of her imagination - and it is interesting that, for all that she despises Melanie, the traits Melanie has which Scarlett most derides are very much the same as those in the Ellen that she idolises.The book has so many fascinating characters that one could read it ten times and still find one has only scratched the surface. Those like myself, who cannot imagine too many settings they'd like to enter less than the &quot;old South,&quot; can find it interesting to explore the situation of those who find their entire world has collapsed around them.",
            "Gone With The Wind is the best book ever written short of the Bible.I have heard people say it's rascist- my opinion is why sugarcoat everything that happened in the Civil War? I think there was rascism at the time the book takes place. The book was written with exhaustive historical truth- if you make it sound like blacks ran around in tuxedos, then you undermine their suffering. And make the book unreal.People did suffer, but not all slaves suffered.If you're looking for a superbly written romance, if you are smart enough to see through people, you will love GWTW. IF you can't, you won't be able to see how Scarlett, shrewd, hard, proud, stubbern, is also smart, learns how to yield, proud as a virtue, and persistant. She complains and dreams the whole time she saves Tara but through sheer grit she does it and saves the people on it.You maybe cannot see how Rhett Butler loves this unseeing woman with complete passion, devotion- 'as much as a man can love a woman'. How the dishonest blockade runner goes crazy when his adored little girl dies. How he is a real daddy to Scarlett's other fatherless children.Read this book--- it is all about people. Anytime we can see ourselves in something, with a small sense of guilt we indenify and fall in love with it.GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!!!",
            "I loved this book! The most amazing thing about GONE WITH THE WIND (and there are many) are the beautiful characters that Mitchell creates. I felt pain, and laughter right along with Scarlett. All the characters seemed so real to me, and I grew to love them so. Mitchell is so brave to have not made a person like Melanie as the main character, a person that everyone would love. Instead she forces the reader to fall in love with a selfish, stubborn, mean, hateful person like Scarlett. Scarlett is definetly my favorite literary figure, she is by no means a perfect person, but you see parts of yourself in her, parts that you may not want to see, and that makes her all the more real. True to form, the most interesting characters in the book are the people with more sinister sides to themselves. To compliment Scarlett, there is of course, Rhett Butler. Every episode he was in came to life, just by the addition of his witty back handed comments, and his insightfullness to realize just how unscrupulous he and others are. Every diolouge is a joy, be it anyone from Prissy, to Rhett speaking, the words fly fromt the page, and never get boring. The turns that the book takes never fail to surprise. Once I got into this book, I couldn't put it down. The most important thing to remember while reading it though, is to take the book as it is. In parts, tales of the blacks lording over the whites, and the views of slaves, are hard to swallow, and painful to read. And they are not entirely accurate. But this was written by a southerner, in a different time, about an EXTREMELY different time, so all of these things must be taken in stride, and read with caution. Over all, this is a book that which will tear at your heart, make you cry with laughter, and, even make you fall in love with an ignorant, racist, Southern Belle.",
            "Gone with the wind is an all time classic. This book is about a girl named Scarlett O'Hara who has a wonderful life until war breaks out and her world is turned upside down.She has to learn the basics to surviving but it comes with difficulty. Along the way she loses two husbands but has one final one which lasts. His name is Rhett Buttler. He helps her become a rich woman again. But is she truly happy? You will have to read to find out. Through all of this there is a moral which is, don't take what you have for granted and apprciate what you have because one day you may not have it.",
            "This book is by far the greatest love story of all time. The ignorant Scarlett O'hara is accustomed to getting her way all the time, but suddenly her once so stable, cushioned life falls out from between fingers. Choosing which dress to wear to balls used to be the issue, now Scarlett must struggle to find each meal, not only for herself but also for the family she supports. As the end of the war begins to approach Scarlett is a young woman who has seen the worst, and still hopes for the best. This book if the timeless tale of a Confederate blockader and a fiesty Southern belle.",
            "Gone With the Wind will totally blow you away, it surely blew me away. This book is a classic love story. It totally draws you in with the push-pull relationship between the main characters, Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara. It makes you want to scream at Scarlett because she just pushes Rhett away unknowingly, and Rhett is trying to pull her into love with money and luxurious clothes. This book is a good book because the events could happen in our time, marry for money and make your selves misreable, but who knows how it could end. If you enjoy books that make you throw them down in frustration, but pick them back up again just to find out what happens next, this book is definitely good for you. If you enjoy this book or were unhappy with the ending, breeze through Scarlett, the sequel to Gone with the Wind. Gone With the Wind is an outstanding book and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys suspense and love all mixed together in a great book.",
            "i think this book is wonderful!i've always liked Gone with the Wind,but when my mom bought it for me,i looked at it and it was so huge,that it took me a long time to finally start reading it.but when i did,not even a bomb could of stopped me from putting it down.i read it every time a got a chance to(between commercials,before school,after school,from 6 to midnight)i even stopped doing everything else i used to do just so i could read it.it is so well written,that you know the characters in and out,even though you never met them.i knew what the characters were like,but just like in real life,there was just so much to know about them,that it's impossible to describe a character.this is the first book and movie that has ever made me cry.when,finally,at the end of the book,scarlett realized that she loves rhett, and not ashley,it's too late and the sad ending(at that time) seemed worse than anything i've ever had to think about.at first,i was mad at three people:rhett,scarlett,and ashley(if you can believe it).rhett-because he didn't tell scarlett that he loved her after they were married(at least not enought for scarlett)and scarlett is too childish to realize that all those things that he for her and her children is because he loves her.scarlett-because her stupid pride stopped her from telling him that she loves him in time and for not telling him that she was sorry for anything that she did or said.and ashley-for realizing and telling scarlett that he doesn't love her way too late.but,in spite of all this,i love this book and i will recommend this to anyone in a heartbeat.",
            "Margaret Mitchell's evergreen saga of the Civil War era has become a kind of cultural icon. This sprawling novel was her sole work, but what a book! Two of the leading protagonists, Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler, are perhaps the best known fictional characters in American literature. The saintly Melanie Wilkes and her reticent husband Ashley are also widely recognized.Northern writers have yet to produce a comparable work. Mitchell's novel plugs into the antebellum nostalgia of the south. Even though her writing arguably does not meet the high standards of gifted southern writers (such as Flannery O'Connor and company), her wonderful narrative skills continue to make this book an enduring best-seller, decade after decade.As generations of American booklovers will testify, &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is a highly rewarding, romantic must-read.",
            "Hello! I read this book because I felt like I had to( It's a classic) and I did think it would be extremely sentimental, soap opera- like and, in Germany where I live we say KITSCHIG. But after a few pages I realised that it was exciting, and I didn't put it down all day. The one thing I disliked was the Ku- Klux- Clan scenes. They all apreciated this terrible, violent clan. This made me angry.Scarlett is a great charakter. She's not sympathatic, but when finally her beloved ones die and turn away from her, you feel sorry for her. A must-have-read!!!!",
            "Gone with the Wind is the most amazing novel ever! I read it in 8th grade for a school project and was so engrossed all 1,024 pages took me just two weeks! Living in the \"North\", I had never really thought about how hard it was for the \"South\" because I assumed they brought it on themselves. This book really opened my eyes and I'm glad it did. I love it so much that this year ... I read it again, just for fun, during the school year and it only took me two weeks again!! I highly recomend this novel to anyone and everyone in the world!",
            "I am not sure how anyone can read the book and not see the love story. It may come near the end, but yes it is there. Gone With the Wind is one of the best books ever written. It incorporates action, romance, drama... I often find myself using silly facts that you learn from the book. Gone With the Wind gives the modern public a look at what life was like for a Southern plantation owner during the Civil War, and no book will ever challenge the status Gone with the Wind has achieved.",
            "This book had everything I like to read about in it. From the vivacious Scarlett, to the loyal Melanie, to the blatant Rhett, the soft Ashley, and all the others, this book has it all. It includes comedy, tragedy, history, emotion, and many other things. My favorite character was Melanie. Scarlett drove me nuts. You get so pulled into the book that I actually stopped reading for a while because Scarlett was eing so mean to Melanie!! Definately a must read in the life of a true gentleperson.",
            "&quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is one of those impossible-to-put-down sagas that everyone should read. It is a perfect read in the summer-nearly 1000 pages to keep you reading throughout those long, lazy days. &quot;Scarlett O'Hara was not beautiful, but men seldom realized it&quot;...from the first lines of the book we are enchanted. And the passionate, emotional story of Scarlett O'Hara is the story of a how a war changed Scarlett's life, the story of how a pampered Southern belle became a woman changed by terrible circumstances. It is a love story, a story of one person, and story of Civil War-era South.There are a couple of key things that make this book the classic that it is. First, Margaret Mitchell really is one of those &quot;born&quot; storytellers. She is wonderful with description, and makes us &quot;feel&quot; things, yet seems to know exactly how much description is too much or too little. She effortlessly creates a seamless story taking place over many years, with never a dull moment on any one of the 954 pages. That alone is enough to make a novel &quot;stand out&quot;.&quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is also filled with vibrant characters. Margaret Mitchell's effective descriptions and keen insights into the minds of each character make this book even better. There is Scarlett, whose stubborn streak, determined mind, and desperate love we see and identify with; there is Melanie, sweet, trusting, and fiercely loyal (she happens to be my favorite character); there is Rhett, the puzzling, reckless, and mysterious blockader who is much like Scarlett; and there is Ashley, the one love that Scarlett cannot have.The only thing about this book that ISN'T absolutely perfect is the racism. Like many Southerners at that time, Margaret Mitchell had a very biased opinion of black people and their place in society. It was disturbing to read descriptions such as &quot;their monkey-like faces&quot; and &quot;darkies need to be treated like children&quot; in this book. However, I think this was in the book because that was how it WAS in the South then, not necessarily because the author thought it SHOULD BE that way. Racism is certainly wrong, but that was a part of the Southern way of life before, during, and after the Civil War.&quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is a wonderfully captivating book filled with characters that we can all identify with. Read it and you'll certainly see why this book, first published in 1936, is still popular today.",

            "The fact that so many people still love this book just shows how racist we still are. It does NOT make it a good book just because you \"like\" it.Don't start with me about Mammy, or about how Scarlett O'Hara doesn't change at ALL throughout the book, except for getting \"tougher.\" Margaret Mitchell did much to immortalize the ridiculous fantasy of \"The South\" that we still cling to today. I'm not saying that there weren't good moments back in Antebellum days, but let's be realistic. In \"Reading Lolita in Tehran,\" the author (I have forgotten her name, may she forgive me) states somewhere that \"even if you're under a benevolent dictator, you're still under a dictator.\"And before I get screams of rage from people who probably also believe in wearing white at their wedding, just remember: just because YOU like it, doesn't mean it's not racist. Just read it with a new eye. That's all I ask. And if you claim that \"ruins\" it, then okay, good. There are plenty of books about plucky heroines that you can read instead, like Jamaica Kincaid's \"Annie John\" and \"Lucy\". Oh, and read \"A Small Place\" while you're at it, to read what Caribbean folks think about our jaunty little cruises down their way.It has to hurt for a while for people to change.",
            "GWTW is one of the best books ever written. Mrs. Mitchell really captured the whole Cival War theme and added a ruthless heroine to the amazing plot to make it even MORE addictive. It tells the story of a woman with gumption, as she called it, spirit, pride, and an everlonging love for Ashley Wilkes. People say it is a racist and sexist book but, in truth, the opinions and views of the characters were how the Southerners thought in the Old South. She wrote about a dream and a mystery that did not survive but was the setting of a love so passionate and endearing that it cannot be described. It told the tale of Knights and their Ladies Fair, of master and of slave. I, personally, thought that the sequel was just as good but it did not give Scarlett the same ruthless qualities. But we must cut Mrs. Ripley some slack, it would be nearly impossible to equal a book as great as GWTW. The plot and characters were simply amazing. Scarlett, the conniving and strong woman that the book focuses on. Rhett, the lover and third husband to Mrs. O'Hara who loved Scarlett so much that it was almost unreal. Melanie Wilkes, the only true friend to Scarlett who was a true gentlewoman with a sense of polite gumption. And then there was Ashley Wilkes, the poor soul that was crushed when the war ended and a person who loved Scarlett dearly but could not and would not abandon his wife and child for society honor. These were the characters that sculpted the greatest love story ever told. It was a Civilization GONE WITH THE WIND.",

            "This epic tale of Georgia during and after the Civil war is quite possibly one of the best literary works I've ever read. It is powerful and filled with completely three dimensional characters. It follows the struggles of Scarlett O'Hara through the harsh realities that women faced during the war and the determination not to starve and to rebuild her life after the fighting ended. Scarlett is a very strong woman-forthright and levelheaded and stubbornly practical. She is a product of the hardships she had to overcome in order to keep her family and herself alive. No, she isn't a likeable character. But it is her flaws that make her endearing. Melanie is a perfect angel and my favorite character. She seems weak on the surface, but she is the foundation for everyone around her. It is her quiet strength that helps everyone stand on their own two feet. You can't help but love her. This book will live in my mind for a long time. I'm so glad to have read it.",
            "Addressing the complexities between a man and a woman, this great American classic \"Gone with The Wind\", which takes place during the Civil War when the South was badly destroyed and crippled, comes to mind. There is really nothing that this reviewer can think of to match the intensity and dynamics between a temperamentally-suited couple such as Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler. The author, Margaret Mitchell, whose own life story is extremely interesting, leaves us at the end of her magnificent saga to determine in the mind of Scarlett as perhaps those of other readers, whether she is going to be resigned to a life of long regrets, or forge ahead 'Tomorrow' in search of her true love. A brilliant portrayal of war and passion between a man and a woman as Old Dixie goes up in flames. One of the best and enduring American love stories ever, Margaret Mitchell hailing from the South, wrote from her heart and about what she knew at the time while never pretending to be an intellect or an historian. And, to think that a vexed Mitchell would not have agreed to make such a splendid contribution to American literature if a friend of hers had not been overheard saying: 'Peggy is too silly to write a book!'.",

            "This is my favorite novel of all time. It's much better than the movie, as is the case with most novels adapted for film. I didn't want it to end!",
            "As the title of the movie portrays it, &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; is the disappearance of a whole civilization after the Civil War, or a civilization gone with the wind. The movie is about the different stages at which the South was before, through, and finally during Reconstruction. At first, we observe how the Southern aristocracy lived during their peak years when the price of cotton was up in the skies. At the barbecue at Twelve Oaks, the Wilk's plantation, the movie depicts the arrogance of the southern gentlemen, since most of them wanted to go to war and blabbered expressions like, &quot;...a southern gentlemen is worth any ten yankees...&quot; They are all absolutely sure that they will win the war in a matter of months, but as it turned out they were absolutely incorrect. During this part of the movie, the views of the South that we observe are pretty biased, because slaves were treated as part of the family and with a lot of respect. In some plantations like the O'Hara's it could've happened, but it was very rare. Suddenly, when war is declared all of the southern beaux go to enlist into the army feverishly. The only one with a realistic view is Rhett Buttler, since he tells the men that before they start talking about victory they should be concerned in building more factories to supply their troops with such things as weapons and clothing. At this time, Rhett is looked at with scorn. But afterwards, he becomes a hero because he is the one who breaks the Union blockade and smuggles supplies into Charleston. When the war drags on, the south is just lingering its defeat. The movie also depicts the southern courage during the war, but with just courage and persistent one can't with the war. The movie is actually very realistic when it shows the wounded and the lack of supplies the southern hospitals had to help them. Finally when the war is about to end, we see General Sherman's troops marching into Atlanta and the evacuation of the city. In this scene, the movie also portrays Scarlett's courage by managing to take Melanie and the baby to Tara. When they finally arrive to Tara, we really see the devastation that took place at the South by the Union troops. At this moment, Scarlett vowed that no matter what she had to do, she would never suffer from hunger again in her life. Later, the carpetbaggers, or the blacks that come from the north, and the scalawags, southern people that supported reconstruction, make life very harsh for the southern people. They raise the taxes to the skies knowing that there is no way for them to be paid, but Scarlett with her strength and wit manages to pay them. Finally when she is established and married to Mr. Douglas, she starts a lumber business with Ashley Wilks. All her old friends criticize Scarlett, since she has become a scalawag herself and is dealing with the northern merchants. This part of the movie is very ironic because Ashley refuses to gain profit from forced labor, in this case prisoners that are brought to the mill by an overseer. Scarlett replies that he used to own slaves, but he tells her that even if the war didn't occur, they were going to be free when his father died. Again we observe the nostalgic and sympathetic view towards the South in the story line. Finally, the movie also presents the reactions that the Southerners had against the colored people. When Scarlett is attacked in the dark side of town, her husband and the other men pretend to be in a 'political meeting' while they are raiding into the blacks area burning their houses and killing some men. They wanted to 'clean' this area so it was safe for Scarlet to travel to the mill. Similar events did take place after the war. In fact, some of them took place in a larger scale and included lynchings and other violent acts. This anti-black feeling lead to the sprouting of groups like the Ku Klux Klan and the violence among both groups continued for a long time. Overall, &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; is a great movie that gives us a feeling of what it was like to live during the Civil War. Although it gets carried away sometimes by being slightly biased, the movie is a very good representation of the events that took place during this period. Besides from providing some historical evidence, it presents the different feelings and responses that the people had towards the confli",
            "This book is captivating from the start.The characters are so real.They aren't all good and Scarlett is a horrible person.That fact only makes you like her more.The ending of this book left me wanting more.That is why I can't wait to read the sequal.Gone With The Wind is a classic and anyone who hasn't read it is missing out.",
            "This book is my favorite. I have read it straight through a few numerous times, but my favorite thing to do is just pick it up and let the pages fall open. It's the kind of book you can do that with. I love the emotion the characters show, and especially what they hide, waiting for you to find out. The vitality of the Old South meeting with the views of one courageous woman and those both behing her and against her is amazing. Scarlett O'Hara , Rhett Butler, and the others are characters never to be forgotten, immortalized forever by Margaret Mitchell.",
            "GWTW has many flaws -- the political views of the book can be most kindly described as &quot;naive,&quot; and its racism is apparent on virtually every page. The second half of the book feels rushed; once Mitchell has actually united Scarlett and Rhett, she no longer seems to write them with the same imagination and humor. All that said, this is the quintessential blockbuster -- not a deep book by any means, but entertaining in ways most novels or movies could never dream of being. Mitchell has a gift of creating fantastical situations for her characters -- and making them seem not only believable but unevitable. The characterization is stronger than is generally realized; Scarlett, Rhett, and Ashley all have layers of complexity that far more &quot;literary&quot; novels often fail to create. It's part of pop culture, and American culture, and for all its flaws and frustrations, an endlessly enjoyable and memorable read.",
            "some people should just shut their mouths. Gone with the Wind was the best book ever written!!! I read it in a week when i was fifteen and fell in love. I had seen the movie seven times before i had read the book. After i read the book though, i became completely obsessed with Gone With the wind, i bought the book and the movie, and have been hunting for any pictures, quotes and reviews. Gone With the Wind- it's not only one of the best books i have ever read, it's an obsession, it's my life.By the way, to those who thought that Gone with the Wind was a ridiculous read because of the length, they can go and get a brain. Good books have a lot of depth to them, and they need all the extra pages they can get. Gone With the Wind is not all about trash, as an underimaginative few found it. It's not only an overdramatic love story, it's not only another one of those American civil war stories. It's really about the complexity of human emotions, feelings, and the way people handle obstacles and life,consequences of actions and emotions and also about certain people and their mutual understanding of each other. When i finished GWTW for the very first time, i continued to think about the extra depth in that book which i just couldn't understand. I read the book several times more, and also began reading in between the lines. In the end i discovered that Magaret Mitchell was an absolute genius. She was no where near the trashy romance writer many had portrayed her to be- she was a realist. She was actually writing about how human spirit and determination, how it can be applied to help one over such obstacles. For those who say there was no depth to gwtw ought to read the book again. Perhaps they read the book to fast for their own benefits, it's such a shame because it only denotes what shallow and uneducated people they are, not being able to understand truly what an amazing conquest Margaret Mitchell had achieved.",

The three stars I gave it are because it is a well written book, and I figure, hey any book with this kind of a reputation deserves something. One note, what about this son of Rhett's? Did Margaret Mitchell just forget to tell us the background on him? Obviously there is a big story behind that...all I can figure is that he is the child of Belle Watling, as the book never really did say why he got involved with her in the first place. I dont feel like reading a sequel that wasnt even written by Margaret Mitchell to find out what happens...

Do NOT buy this format of the book.",
            "I was one of those who disappeared for a few days until I finished the book. A great, spellbinding novel. With that said, the history in the book is terrible. This is such a warped perspective on slavery; it is history through the eyes of Simon LeGree. We are supposed to believe that the slaves really loved \"Massa\", instead of being kept in place by the lash, the chain, and the gun. Further, the Reconstruction governments in the South did some great things. The South has done an excellent job of rewriting history to make themselves look good. This novel is unfortunately the basis for many people's view of history of these times. We are supposed to feel bad that the \"glorious\" days of the slave plantation are \"gone with the wind.\"",
            "I am sorry , but I did not like Gone With The Wind(I am a senior in highschool and despite what everyone thinks about highschoolers, I am well read. And I have read books by James A Michener and John Jakes). I will admit that Scarlett has an amazing ability to survive, but it is only by her own selfishness that she does. I would rather read a different book about the civil war that contains better people than Scarlett. I feel sorry for the men that fall in love with Scarlett and I feel sorry for Scarlett because the one man she loves is lost to her. I do not believe in pining after something one cannot have, it wastes a lot of time and is too much wasted emotion. Even though I do not like Scarlett, I do appreciate the facts that Mitchell worked in about the civil war, such as the burning of Atlanta and what happened when the former slaves were given the right to vote and hold office. All in all, Gone With The Wind is an O.K. book, if you do not mind inconclusive endings and selfish people.",
            "The book was well written but personally I liked the movie better. Yes the book was about many things but the part that urked me was the romanticized view of the South's struggle with \"the low class treacherous Yankees\" and the so called uppity negroes. Oh how insolent and thirsty these \"brutes\" were for any thing white in a dress (southern propaganda of the reconstruction era and of Mitchell's own era.) Mitchell leaves out the fact that almost every Southern slave owner was himself only a gentleman during the day but at night was more treacherous to black womanhood than any \"darky\" ever was to that of white womanhood. Unfortunately many Americans know very little about history and therefore will sadly accept the lies and fantasies that Mitchell's book has exposed our society to. As I stated earlier, it was well written and I took great pains to read it in its entirety waiting for the point in which Mitchell's account of the South would be fair and balanced (since the movie wasn't so bad) but unfortunately it seemed Mitchell really believed that blacks who had been stolen from their homeland, whipped for not picking someone else's cotton fast enough, raped by their masters, abused by jealous mistresses were supposed to turn around after being freed and say \"thankee Massuh fo' all dat ya dun dun fo' me.\" Thank goodness for Alex Haley's Roots!",
            "oh god the ending! the ending! the ending!(it is best to read the book before you watch the movie)",
            "As angela camack pointed out, the film &quot;gone with the wind represents the institution of slavery as a walk in the park. The fact that the movie lasted over a period of years and it rarely showed a violent act towards a Black person is solid proof. The truth of the matter is that slavery in the deep south, likes places such as south carolina, was incredibly brutal and violated most human rights. The film attempted to depict slavery as a life where none of the slaves got beaten, whipped or raped, when in reality violent acts towards Black individuals was a common day occurrence. According to Frederick Douglass slaves were beaten weekly to strike fear into the other slaves. Women were raped continually over years of their lives in order to perpetuate the institution of slavery. Families were torn apart from each other due to the trading and selling of slaves. Gone With the Wind could have done a little more justice to Black Americans by not under emphasizing the torture and pain that they endured during the 19th century.Apart from its ignorant illusion of slavery the movie does illustrate, as Mark Burgh points out, the hardships of post Civil War life in the south. Scarlett O'Hara never had to do a thing for herself before the war. By the time Sherman was done marching to the sea she had made up her mind that she was going to conform to the new northern way of life in order to survive under the new politic. A lot of people in the south had to make that change, and I think that movie does an excellent job of showing the changes in life style before and after the war",
            "but it works, mainly because of Scarlett and Ashley, who are engaging if limited characters. Rhett Butler begins as interesting but is ultimately tiresome. Mammy is engaging, Prissy less so. The less said about Melanie and Ellen the better. Don't count on it as history lesson, either. Really, it's not much more than a well written bodice ripper (which explains why it has so many adolescent fans) but bodice rippers are often fun.",
            "Thank You for sending what I asked for. I bought a $2.88 hardback book and I cannot complain. All I wanted was all the pages attached to the binder and that is what I got. Plus it was kind of neat because someones Aunt had signed it to her niece. Shows me the book has been well loved.",
            "One of the greatest american epic stories of all time and one of the only books to ever be correctly adapted to the silver screen. Scarlet is a wonderful character as is Rhett. The only thing you could wish for is a slightly better ending.",
            "Believe it or not, the book is better than the film -- more historical insight and background.",
            "Some books you love and you forget the characters after a few days. Some books you love and the characters stay with you forever - Gone With The Wind is one of these books!",
            "When I first read this book a year ago, I fell in love with it.i really enjoyed everything about this book. I cant tell you witch parts i like more.This is the type of book that should be read by everybody!",
            "I loved this book. It is a classic and everyone should read it! The sequel is also a must read!",
            "This was the best book I read in a while. Even though it is long, it is a beautiful love story of Scarlett O'Hare and Rhett Butler. It is a learning experience for all readers. A must read! I can't wait to read Scarlett: The Sequel!",
            "I read it when I was 11 and my opinion was, and still is, &quot;pretty good, for a romance.&quot; But it's probably just me, because I'm more into science fiction and mythology. bit of a difference, isn't it? P.S.- if you really liked GWTW, don't read the sequel, _Scarlett_. I'll tell you, it's pretty different from what I imagined.",
            "Even though I am only thirteen, I am still able to grasp the grandeur of this novel. It is truly one of a kind.",
            "This book is extraordinary! It is truly a brillant piece of literature. To any one who has never read this book, you need to read it. The movie is good, but the book is so much better!Scarlett O'Hara is the epitome of a selfish, spoiled brat . . . but you just gotta love her",
            "Gone with the Wind is by far one of the best written books of our century. It takes us back through time, to a civilazation long since forgotten. To a time when all was well in the Old South, where beauty ran wild amidst the red clay of Georgia. From the outbreak of the Civil War in the view point of Georgian belle Scarlett O'Hara, to the end and beyond we become engrossed to the point where it is impossible to put the book down. The story follows the life of Scarlett O'Hara daughter of a wild Irishman and an aristocratic but kind French lady. We follow Scarlett through her weddings and her childbirths, through her long trip home to her beloved Tara. We experiance her rejection and her revilation that the land is the only thing that really lasts and the only thing worth fighting for. Through her pain and her misery, through her laughter, and her tears we laugh with her and cry with her. We feel the hardships of war and the fury of the aftermath, and we watch, as does Scarlett and the rest of the all star cast, the destruction of a civilazation that is truly Gone with the Wind. For everyone who loves the Old South, for anyone who loves a good book. Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind truly touches her readers, and makes one unforgettable novel.",
            "I finally read this book years after seeing the motion picture. I fell in love with the characters and found my sympathies and compassion straining towards those I hadn't imagined I could feel anything for... Rhett knew what he was getting into, yet he loved Scarlet despite all her fall-backs and the knowledge he'd always be in another man's shadow. Rhett and Melanie were my favourite characters because they were both strong people who had the courage to love. I agree this book could be seen as racist, yet I also believe it is a historical novel in some parts which does justice to the Southerners side of the story. Yes, none of us agree with slavery. However, those were the times and that's how life was. Margaret Mitchell is being true. She displays the sympathies of the time her book is set. Judging it by modern standards of racism is the same as judging Shakespeare by modern political correctness. You can't. I belive this is a beautiful book and a beautiful love story. I encourage anyone with an open mind and a compassionate heart to read it.",
            "This book is absolutely the best. You would have to be a fool not to enjoy this book. It is beautifully written, and extremely enjoyable. Its length is an excellent support, for if you are hungry for more, it is always coming. READ THIS BOOK AND YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPOINTED!",
            "I picked up this book from the library when I was only 11. Every time I read a book I have a new fave book,but this book is my very favorite. Scarlett O'Hara may be an absolute brat, but I love her. She's got spunk and sprit!Melanie is such a sweet charachter! Rhett is imposible, but hysericaly funny! This book takes you through 12 years of Scarlett's life. It is funny, touching, and very real. When I read this book, I laughed,pondered over certain ideas, and cried. This is an iresistible romance, which teaches leasons about life and love. I recomended this book to any one!",
            "This book is a very interesting one. Me being 14 years old, I didn't think I was going to like it at all because I'm not the fondest person of reading. But I found it very interesting, and easy to follow most of the time. It took me back to the time of the Civil War, and I felt I was actually there. I would recommand this book to amyone. Especially ones that are interested in Historical-Ficiton.",
            "Scarlett O'Hara is the ultimate survivor. She has more inner strength and passion than any man or woman in the story except, of course, for Rhett Butler. &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; is the kind of book that you don't just read; you actually live the story, and when you finish reading the last page, you are bereft because you miss the characters so much. The characters are so clearly defined you feel that you know them. The story of the finely detailed lives of every single character, told against the background of some of the most romantic, disburbing, and turbulent years of American history, is unparalled. It is a great tribute to Margaret Mitchell that her only published work is loved and revered by so many. Anyone who thinks he knows the story of &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; from seeing the movie is sadly mistaken. This story MUST BE READ to be truly appreciated!",
            "I not only have one dog earred copy of this book, I have two dog earred copies of this book on my nightstand. What a great book! Inspiring, thoughtful and interesting all at that same time. Yes, there are racist elements and sterotypical themes (the use of the \"n\" word is discusting and offensive and the view that the slaves were \"Happy\" was absolutely discusting). The issue of slavery was sugar-coated - the slaves were never depicted as being human beings with thoughts and feelings - they were just charactures meant to serve their Caucasian \"masters\". I enjoyed reading about the historical aspect of the Civil War. The characters of Scarlett and Rhett do not pretend to be something they are not - both are shrewd, focused, fiesty. Is Scarlett a spoiled little brat? Yes, of course she is, but somehow the author makes you want to root for her in the end because Scarlett fights for what she wants and never gives up. I think those are admirable qualities for any person to have.I agree with other posts that there was no reason for a sequel(s). The sequel really served no purpose other than to confirm what (most) of us already knew or hoped - that Scarlett and Rhett would end up together anyway.",
            "I think everyone either loves or hates this book-so here I'm just going to say that I love this book, and I really believe it is one of the finest novels ever written. Yes, it portrays black slaves as their owners saw them in the Civil war-as inferior people. But would it really have been historical fiction if it had been any other way? This is not just a novel about Scarlet and Rhett Butler-this is a book about the pre-civil war way of life in the South and the way the real southerners, the ones who lost their slaves and plantations and had to make a major adjustment on their viewpoints on race, lived. Scarlet and Rhett and Melony and Ashley-they are some of the best written characters ever created. And no, you shouldn't be able to understand their mindset. They lived a hundred and fifty years ago and no one today has a mindset like that. Good historical fiction should always put you in a mindset that it hard to understand and relate to-because otherwise it's just a character in the past with a modern mindset.Read this book if you want to know true history. The way the war is portrayed is gruesome and terrible, but like a car wreck you can't look away. The writing shows the true effect it has on the lives it touched and the horrible way it changed and damaged all the people who lived through it. It is fascinating, impeccably written as far as the historical facts go, and also romantic and enjoyable. I read this book every year and every time I love it. If you like historical fiction, read this book. If you like history, read this book. Even if you think this book is raciest and terrible, read the book. Understand a different viewpoint on history.Besides, the author was not a raciest at all. This is FICTION folks.This is the ultimate historical fiction, and every one should read it. From page one you will be trapped.So much more than five stars.",
            "Having just watched the movie recently after many years, I realized anew how wonderful the book is in comparison! Scarlett is more than just a money-hungry b****, Rhett is *much* more than the wimp who kept telling her he loved her in the movie, etc.I love GWTW because it's one of the few books that remains true to its characters. A happy ending was never possible for Rhett and Scarlett, because she saw him as more scoundrel than soul mate until the very end. He put up with *more* than enough from her before his love gave out, and he hid that love from her except on two memorable occasions.This is an interesting portrait of the South, and in turn, of Marget Mitchell herself. The racism in this novel never bothered me, because she was simply seeing life through the filter of her own life and experiences. Things were so different back then; how can anyone judge from today's perspective?I'd recommend this book to anyone. I read it first when I was 11 years old, but so much of the adult content and nuances went over my head that I wouldn't recommend this to children.",
            "Gone With The Wind is no doubt THE classic Civil War novel. However, the major characteristic that enables it to achieve its greatness also condemns Scarlet to a life of unrequited love and dooms her potential for happiness with Rhett. That attribute is that it is written entirely from the woman's viewpoint.The perspective is a strength because it permits the author to vividly portray the destruction of Southern society better than any battlefield-centered novel could. Regrettably, it also leaves the author, and therefore Scarlet as well, incapable of understanding the male characters. They are merely personalities that fade in-and-out of the background to shape the narrative. While they are characters that can stand up off the page and cast a shadow, there is no tone or timbre in their images.For example, Rhett notes that he was nearly killed stealing the horse to get Scarlet out of Atlanta before it was burned. But Mitchell does not describe the theft. Therefore, Scarlet (and Mitchell herself) cannot appreciate Rhett's ordeal or gain true insight into his character.In another instance the novel mentions that Rhett fought at the battle of Franklin. What Mitchell does NOT tell the reader is that Franklin was probably the bloodiest defeat of a Confederate army in the entire war. For Southern arms its horrors are unmatched by any of the better known battles in Virginia or elsewhere. Mitchell fails to narrate this experience and thereby misses yet another opportunity understand and appreciate Rhett.In short, since Mitchell herself failed to share much of Rhett's (or any man's) experiences, the chances that Scarlet could find true love were as slim as an Apache Indian getting elected Pope. Mitchell and Scarlet sought only to be understood and not to understand.",
            "I read it when I was 11 and I could hardly put it down, it took me 5 days to read this amazing book. Sure there is a dead spot in the middle and it gets a little depressing, but it is worth the read. I recommend this book to anyone who likes civil war romance.",
            "I read Gone with the Wind last summer and could not put it down...and then I read it again. I've read many great books in the classic genre, but none have been able to captivate me as Gone with the Wind has. Mitchell paints her characters so vivdly that as you read about their hardships during the Civil War and Reconstruction you just want to cry. Gone with the Wind is truly one of the best books ever written.",
            "For all of you that have read GWTW you must know why this is my favorite book ever! I am 15 and I read this book around a month ago after a friend of mine told me I just had to read it and I could not put it down. My Mom encouraged me too as she loved it also. Now I know what everyone is raving about. This saga simply swept me off my feet! This isn't just a novel for young girls...it's for everyone and you just have to read it. I was captivated by Mitchell's breathtaking descriptions of the south and how can any female just not fall in love with Rhett? It's almost impossible to describe to you all the aspects of this novel! I went through this book so fast...at times I laughed but there were also times when you ge so annoyed, frusturated and angry at Scarlett's antics (forget about Ashley already!) but you cannot help loving her for who she is too. Though GWTW may not be 100% historically accurate...who really cares!? Also, I just saw the movie...don't miss it!! That was just wonderful as well. (it was also voted the #2 Romance movie of all time by the Amerian Film Institute recently!) As for the sequel, Scarlett, I was a little dissapointed but I had to have closure and have the comfort of knowing Rhett took Scarlett back. All in all, read Gone With the Wind! This monumental epic has all the aspects of a book anyone could ever look for.",
            "You can tell by every other review of this book and probably by the advice of people you know that &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; is an enduring classic. I LOVE THIS BOOK! But, be warned that this paperback edition has several spelling and gramatical errors. I was quite disapointed by the editing done here.",
            "Gone With The Wind is one of the most powerful works of literature I've ever read- its fluildy eloquent style and intricatly crafted descriptions make it seem more like a scene being played out, rather than words on page. I couldn't put it down- there are so many twists, and nothing turns out the way you hope it would. This is the best book I've ever read, and I recommend it to everyone.",
            "Gone With the Wind is a great book that gives lots of descriptive detail, it as if you are there in the story. The book puts the movie to shame. I read the book before seeing the movie and I am glad I did. With as much detail that is in the book it is hard to make any kind of movie from it. The book story line is set during the Civil War. Placing the story during the Civil War makes the action and adventure seeker want to read the book. Although the book takes about war a lot there are several love triangles in the book. Having these love triangles in the story keeps the tension in the story and makes the read wonder who will be with who next. Having the story take place during this time brings a sense of realism to the book and makes the reader feel for the characters during this time. The book is also set in the point of view of the south. Having the book take place in the south is different and makes the reader realize why the war was being fought. This is a very fun book to read and I would recommend it anyone.",
            "Gone With The Wind is the best book I have ever read. I like it because of the setting{I like the old time books}and the characters. I also like it because it is very long and keeps my interest, which is very hard to do. So I think it is a good book to read.",
            "This is an great book. The character interaction, the historical sweep, everything. If you love, or even like, the movie, you should definitely read this book. There are so many things, even characters, in the book that were left out of the movie, the book fleshes everything out. I absolutely recommend this book!",
            "As an avid reader, I read this book, all 1037 pages, within about a week. I just couldn't put it down. Margaret Mitchell has skillfully woven life's everyday struggles in with the struggles only faced during Reconstruction. Although I do not beleive in Scarlett's thoughts about the war and Yankees and so on, it was almost hard not to empathyize with her and her struggles. Although all in all a nasty person, sometimes you can't help but love her.The strength of character portrayed by Melanie Wilkes has decided for me what I will name my first little girl. Melanie.As for Rhett, I do believe he is my favorite of them all.",
            "This book was an amazing view of the Civil War era as well as a beautiful love story. It is a testament to the strain the war caused on every person in the country at the time. Aside from the war it let's you in to the parts of your soul that too many try to hide. Some people think Scarlett was a demon, but I think she was and is a part of every person. Everyone should read GWTW. If you don't your really missing out. It is by far the best I've ever read and I'm convinced I'll never find better.",
            "This is not the type of book I usually read. I am into Mary Higgans Clark and John Grisham. I only read this book because of school, and thought that I could sort of skim through it. Well after the first sentence I couldn't help but read every page word for word. This book is a page turner if I've ever seen one. You would think that the ending would be annoying, because it is so open, but I love it. I won't ever read the sequel because it could never even come close to the book. No matter hot good it is GWTW will be a thousand times better. I read this book in 10 days. That's like 100 pages a day, but I even forgot there were 1000 pages. You get so involved in the romance of Scarlett and Rhett that you could care less of the thickness of the book. I you haven't read this book, your are missing out on not only the greatest love story ever, but the greatest novel ever written. I picked up the book thinking that I had to read a book during the summer and that with all the talk about this one I might as well try it. I soon realized that ever positive review I have read about it can't come close to describing this book.",
            "This is my all time favorite book. I read it in the eigth grade and since them I have read it several times. I first started reading this book because of the movie, but after reading the first few hundred pages, I virtually forgot that there was a movie. The 1939 movie with Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable is spectacular but Mitchell's book surpasses that greatness. This is the novel that proves the saying that the book is always better than the movie.I have read all the reviews that people have published on this site and it amazes me that anyone gave GTWT less than five stars. I couldn't put this book down!Gone With the Wind is romance to the highest degree and it only improves each time I read it. Scarlet's encounters with Rhett are my favorite part of this book. Everytime they meet it draws me in. The thing that makes this book great however, is that it isn't just about romance, it is about survival and although Scarlet isn't the nicest person like Melanie, it is hard to not root for her. She does everything all the way and never holds back what she is feeling.",
            "I read this book for the first time when I was 14 and I havebeen in love with it ever since. Scarlett was desperate for love, butwas looking in all the wrong places. She loved Rhett, but was too determined to make it in the world without him in an era that frowned on women behaving in that manner. In the end, she only defeated her own purpose; she had plenty of money, but no love. The characters in this book were written with such vivid color that they will live forever, whether in print or on screen.",
            "I read the book before seeing the movie, and the movie makes the book look horrible! I have read GWTW at least ten times and it gets better everytime I read it. I can picture the scences as I read the book. This is the ultimate love story about a woman looking for love and security when it's right in her face. I always cry at the end but I know Scarlett will get Rhett back, she'll just put it out of her mind and think of it tomorrow.",
            "This is the best book ever written. I first read it the summer before eighth grade, and then again around February of that year. There is so much drama. I read the book before seeing the movie, but I don't think it matters what order you do them in, as long as you do both. Everyone should read and watch Gone With the Wind sometime in their life. My favorite character is Scarlett, because she changes and learns so much throughout the book. She learns that she really didn't love Ashley, and she really loved Rhett, although she realized that too late. Scarlett realized how selfish she was to marry two men she didn't love. She married Charles when he was really India's beau, and regretted it when Charles died, like what happened when she stole Frank, her sister's beau. I know I gave this book five stars, but it deserves so much more. Gone With the Wind is a must read for anyone!",
            "I had fought against reading the book for many years. Having seen the movie many times, I thought &quot;Why should I wade through a thousand pages?&quot; Well, something drove me to start the book and I surprised myself by not being able to put it down. I recall actually rushing home from work, barely eating and reading late in the night. The story line is good, and the characters believable. It also provides come insight into a phase of American history, something we all could use. Don't delay - read it soon. I doubt if you'll regret it.",
            "I am 17 and just finish reading Gone with the Wind and thesequal. I loved all the charaters except Ashley. I believe everyemotion that the characters felt and I even know people who are as selfish as Scarlett. The author did a great job in describing everything but I did not enjoy the racism. But one must understand that she grew up in the early 1900s and in the south. She must have heard stories of the war because the rage and anger was still fresh in their minds. It cannot be expected that the book will not be racist when the author grew up with it. It must be overlooked in order to enjoy the great story. In the days that I read it I did not eat, sleep, talk to anybody, or even watch t.v. because it swept me into the world of the American Civil War. The 1000 and plus pages go by in a flash and you wish there were more. I suggest to everybody not to read the sequal because it ruins the characters and is completly unbelieveable and foolish. I loved Rhett, Scarett, and Melly because they have true human emotions. I recommand to watch the movie first so you won't be disappointed. You'll enjoy the handsome Clark Gable, the beautiful Vivien Leigh, and the charming Olivia de Havilland. Great novel!!!",
            "Gone With the Wind, the timeless tale of the old south, depicts colourful characters as they strugggle with the hardships of love, life and the Civil War. Scarlett O'Hara, a tragic hero, matures of her love of Ashley Wilkes, by means of her life experiences, which wisen Scarlett of her downfalls and also her attributes. The fact that the situation thrust upon her wisens her, she is forced to mature herself, and this included her selfish ways. Gone with the Wind is a classic, a must for all who study, or who are remotly interested in the modern history of America.",
            "Well, for starters, I read the book before ever seeing the movie. Margaret Mitchell did a great job on her first novel. I read Scarlett (gets a bit nasty in places, and totally unbelievable), but GWTW is THE book to read. My copy is 1,024 pages long. Don't freak. Amazingly enough, even people who don't like long books ought to like it. Now for the opinions. I hated Ashley, in the book and the movie. I didn't like Melanie very much (&quot;Oh, Melly, don't be a goose.&quot;) 'cause she was so lovable. She was basically perfect. Rhett was a total jerk at times. You probably figured out by now that I side with Scarlett. She was tough, yet tender at times. I think that this book should occupy a place on your shelf or in your hand.",
            "I'm 14. I read this book last winter and still quote words and actually use things the characters learned in this saga to improve my own life. Its almost like self-help but in such an entertaining way. The way the book is written, it is almost as if you are afraid to put the book down because the characters (especially Scarlett, she is quite busy) may do something without you. It is truely the best book I have ever read, and I don't even like historical fiction! i recommend this to anyone who can read. Enjoy!",
            "After all these years, I never got around to reading the book, even after seeing the movie several times. Sorry I waited so long. This is one of the best books I have read. Truly how the South was...",
            "This product was definatly worth the few dollars I spent! I love classics esspecially the more historic ones and this book was in execent condition to be as old as it is.",
            "The book I received was in good shape. The seller shipped it very promptly and I received it within a week. It was packaged securely. I recommend this seller to anyone who runs across them. They are very professional.",
            "I've read Gone With The Wind several times over the years and I have always loved it. I loaded my copies out to people who never returned them to my dismay. So, I'm replacing these copies and intent to read again. Good quality of book.",
            "I loved this book! Scarlet is an authentic heroine- complicated and believable. I will remember more of the story of the Civil War from her story than I ever would from reading a history book. I lived in Georgia for about 4 years and the sense of state-pride was always sort of a mystery to me. Reading Gone with the Wind helped me to better understand the story of the civil war from the southern perspective and better understand the chivalrous culture still present today.",
            "I never tire of reading Gone with the Wind. I just preferred to read the hard back this time.",
            "It is hard to imagine anyone having the nerve to tackle a review of this book, as it is a classic and has already survived any review ever given to it. Suffice it to say that I read it the first time at 16, and it has remained my favorite book ever since. Written by a southerner who grew up on the stories, this novel will entertain and educate you about the Civil War, life on a plantation, and the courage to survive against all odds.",
            "It is a wonderful story...I love the different perspective of the civil war.It is also funny, witty, and well-written. One of the best love stories of all time.I was sorry to see it end, and although I haven't read the sequel, I am sure it can not do Margaret Mitchell's work justice. The only person who I think could write an adequate sequel is Margaret Mitchell herself.Gone With the Wind is definitely a five star novel.",
            "I purchased this copy of Gone with the Wind because I particularly liked the blue cover. The package arrived safely and in a timely manner. I was pleased with the transaction.",
            "I personally very much enjoyed \"Gone With the Wind\". It was filled with romance as well as peril and unpredictability. I recomend this book for young adults and adults because it is not a kid theme.",
            "When I first read Gone with the wind many years ago at age 25, I had watched the movie many times and loved it. Then when I read the book, I fell in love with it hailing it as the best book I'd ever read in my life. At that time though, I did find the in depth descriptions of the surroundings and of backgrounds of people a little tedious. Other than that, I loved it and my lifelong love of Civil War history was started right then and there. As the years went by and I read so many more books, a few years ago there began to be other books that took the title of \"best book\" in my eyes, always keeping that great love of GWTW in my heart. However, at age 52, I decided to read it again. It just called to me for some reason. This time, I loved it even so much more than I did then, and what I disliked about it years ago, the descriptive writing of Margaret Mitchell, is one of the things I loved about it most of all. It takes a tremendous amount of talent for a writer to totally immerse the reader into the setting they have created, when they can just see the lush beauty, the red clay, the desolation, the dying wounded, everything that was written, you lived it, smelled it, and felt it. I was in this story from beginning to end, and I lost myself in it completely. It now has rightfully taken its place as my favorite book of all time.Yes, It is a book where the main character is a selfish, spoiled rich plantation owner's daughter, that lost everything she had that she knew in the world, her home, her parents, many friends, her money, and how she clawed herself back to the top no matter who she ran over or hurt along the way. She is an unlikeable character that you cannot help but like anyway for the sheer will and determination she has to survive. Somewhere along that road of selfishness, she developed a conscience even though she stifled it whenever it reared it's head and went on being ruthless anyway. Also somewhere along the road, she realized that there was a feeling she could not quite identify in her heart about Melanie and Rhett, a feeling she did not realize was love until it was too late to enjoy that love. Oh you knew she was ruthless and hard, but you knew there was some good in her somewhere (was there?) and you rooted for her.Then there's Rhett. The rebellious, sarcastic, making money at the ruin of others, handsome man that fell in love with her the moment he cast eyes upon her. He was there for her so many times over the years, but she never really appreciated him. He loved her so much, but never let on in words that he did because he knew anyone that admitted they loved her, she would run over like she did so many other poor men that loved her, may they rest in peace. She realized she loved him much too late.There's Melanie, the mild, sweet shy girl-like woman who Scarlett said she hated because she was Ashley's wife (and of course Scarlett was in love with Ashley). So sweet and mild, she has a fierce loyalty and love for Scarlett, which Scarlett also didn't fully realize until it was too late.And Ashley, poor pitiful Ashley who she just thought she loved all these years only to finally realize she was In love with an idea of him, not him. She wasted all those years not realizing this, again, until it was too late.Mixing with all these wonderful characters and more, is a story about the south and how the world they knew was lost. Though it was a world that had many wrongs that should not have happened and that I'm glad was put an end, you can't help but feel their loss, feel the horror as they watched their houses and Atlanta burn to the ground. You feel their hungriness as they have nothing to eat, feel their shame as they have nothing but rags left to wear, feel their bitterness as they are under Yankee rule during the reconstruction.It's also a story about what different people do to survive. In this case, does one go with the flow and make the best out of a new situation and reap the benefits that they can in the situation they're in, or does one stay loyal to a cause that was burned to the ground and is no more and stay humbled and hungry? Does one sell their soul and prosper at the cost of others? Scarlett took advantage of the situation she was in and it made no difference who she ran over to do it or if she did forget the cause for which a war was fought. However, in the end, I think she realized that to have all she acquired, a very high price was paid for it all.This book was so great on so many levels, even more that what I've written here. For to go on, it would be way longer that this. I think it's a masterpiece.I do want to say one more thing, last but not least, about the author Margaret Mitchell. Though this was her only published novel, she did not drop down out of the sky to write this book out of nowhere. Growing up she wrote complete stories all the time as a little girl, was in drama at school, and as a young adult, worked as a journalist until she had to quit due to an ankle injury. She was born into a family rich in civil war history and many of her family had actually fought and lived during the civil war and she sat on many a lap listening to these stories throughout her childhood. She was born, lived and died in the city she wrote about, Atlanta. She knew of what she wrote about and it's historically accurate. She died, unfortunately, at the age of 48, hit by a drunk driver, crossing Peachtree St. (a street mentioned many times in the book), with her husband on the way to the movies. 5 days later she died, she was buried in Oakland Cemetary, (a graveyard mentioned in the book). To me, this book could have never been surpassed and I feel so good knowing that in her short life, she chose to leave this masterpiece for us all to enjoy forever. I, for one, am grateful. Thank you Margaret Mitchell.",
            "I have to say, at about 60-80 pages in, I was tempted to give up on this monstrous, 1000+ beast of a book, but Ifm glad I didnft. I have this strange compulsion to ALWAYS finish books, despite how bad they are in the beginning, in the hopes they get better. And this one certainly did.I wonft spend much time on plot, because truthfully, the only people that arenft aware of the basic plot of this book are those of you who were like me and obviously living under the largest rock in the world. Ifd like to start, instead, with Scarlett.Scarlett happens to be the most reprehensible, vile, and childish character Ifve ever encountered. And I love her. No matter how foolish I thought she was, I always wanted to read on to see what happened to her. I think this is where Mitchell really did something really wonderful. It is almost impossible to have complete disgust in a character and still want to know what her ending is. This is how I felt about Scarlett. I wanted to shake her until she developed some semblance of sense, but I then realized that this book has a sense of a bildungsroman to it. Yes, it is about life during the Civil War, and about romance, and many other things, but itfs mainly about Scarlett and her journey to womanhood. In my personal opinion, the interesting part is that she never really reaches that womanhood, despite all her hardships.I am not one for historical fiction. I will admit that I like historical war fiction even less. But although the novel is set during the time of the Civil War, and there are excerpts of the battles in it, I wasnft overwhelmed enough by it to dislike it. It was vaguely interesting to me, and didnft take away from the main story.I also wouldnft call this a romance, because, for all intents and purposes, Scarlett is never in love with anyone. She appears to be in love with Ashley throughout the entire book, and despite the many comments I may receive about this, I truthfully donft think she was ever in love with Rhett. I think she was in love with the idea of both of these men. The only person Scarlett is in love with is herself. And the only thing she is in love with is money. Which brings me to my next point: Mitchell took a huge risk making Scarlett the woman she did.Scarlett become a strong, independent, although still childish, woman. Her only gfallh is that she realizes she glovesh Rhett too late in the game, and has to (presumably) spend her life wanting him and never fully having him. Generally, when women of the 1800s are fictionalized as strong and independent, there are seriously negative connotations associated with them. You see this some with Scarlett, but she doesnft let it affect her. She is all in all strong. Silly in many regards, but strong. This is where Mitchell, in my opinion, really broke the mold. She allowed her character to suffer through so much pain and heartache and yet let her continue as an unbroken woman. Scarlett doesnft appear to be marred by anything but her own agenda. And I absolutely respect that, even though I still think she needs a bit more sense.I have to give this one s s s s. I truly loved it, with the exception of the lack of a love story. I guess in my head, I had considered this the greatest romance of all time (and I honestly couldnft tell you where I got this misperception), and I really found that lacking. Other than that, I would recommend this book to anyone who even remotely enjoys reading.If you enjoyed this review, come read others at [...]!",

            "There are a few main factors that fed into how I reviewed the book:1. Scarlett is annoying, not that bright, pretty cruel, and not my idea of a great lady. She doesn't really change for the better and her violent reactions become predictable.2. The story is woven very nicely, though it is extremely verbose at times.3. Mitchell created vivid, interesting characters who were fun to observe (with the exception of Scarlett, at times).4. People rant and rave over it being a racist novel, which is, in a sense, true. It is a book written about a racist group of people during a racist period of history in an area that was known to be very racist at the time. It was interesting to see how unapologetically racist people could be, according to Mitchell's storytelling at least. The book, though, is not racist in the sense that it supports racism and bigotry. In fact, I walked away from this book with a heightened interest in learning more about what freed slaves endured during the years following the war. For me, the mark of a good book is whether it encourages further study and intellectual curiosity, which Gone With the WInd can do.",
            "This is the greatest story ever written. It is not just the love story of Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara, but it is the saga of Scarlett's life, and how she blossoms from young sixteen-year-old to a strong willed woman. It will leave you breathless.",
            "we all love the movie with the leery Clark Gable and the fiery Vivien Leigh- but the novel is much, much more. With this classic, you find yourself bonding with Scarlet- hating her for her obstinate obsessions and agreeing with her basic desires. Melonie Hamilton isn't quite as serene as the movie, but she is just as goodie-goodie. Rhett Butler is good. I'm a high school student, and I read Gone with the Wind in the sixth grade. it was fabulous and everyone should be exposed to the all-too human Scarlet O'Hara.",

            "Remembering when this book, \"Gone With The Wind\", first came out, my mother told me that my her brother, a doctor from Montreal Canada, who had settled in the USA, had read it all the way through, finding it compulsively readable. Years and years, (and years!), later, on the 50th Anniverary of GWTW, (the movie, I think), TV GUIDE ran two -- or perhaps it was three -- articles on this book / movie phenomenon. One was a general overview of the movie, and comments from surviving leading players. The other two were equally as fascinating: one was written by a White woman, the other, by a Black man.The White woman said that the value she had gotten from this book was that she had learnt from it, to withstand any hardship, no matter how great.The Black man said that he had been SO ashamed to buy this book. As much ashamed as he would have been, had he bought a pornography book! After reading it, he opined that it did NOT focus on the cruelty, pain, and degradation of slavery, but instead on a woman in love with another woman's financee and later, husband. He compared the book to a hypothetical novel set in World War II, wherein a Nazi officer, a guard in a concentration camp, was having a romance with a secretary. The pain and suffering of so many people, all around them, is all but ignored, in this hypothetical book, as all the attention is on the two lovers. Obviously, the Black gentleman who wrote this article for TV Guide did not like GWTW at all....I think it's important to keep BOTH viewpoints in mind. Because both are very accurate, and both speak volumes about the meaning of \"Gone With The Wind\".",
            "I have enjoyed reading Gone with the Wind. I found the book in great shape.",
            "Gone With The Wind is a classic of mid-twentieth century epic fiction. I read it years after being misguided by Ayn Rand and I was stunned when I realized how closely Rand mimicked Mitchell's prose. Perhaps it was simply the writing style of the time. Mitchell and Rand differ, though, and if both writers create characters that are larger than life, Mitchell's are real while Rand's are pure fantasy.Scarlett O'Hara starts off as a prissy, selfish sixteen year old. She's in love with a beautiful wimp and can't stand losing him to a saintly rival. She marries someone else out of spite at her loss just as the Civil War begins. She's soon a widow and her estate is destroyed, her family in ruins. She marries again to a man with a sound business but no business sense. She takes over his lumber enterprise and gets thing done. She's again widowed and marries Rhett Butler, a man who has all her gumption but whose self interest is tempered by empathy for the aspirations and hopes of others.Scarlett is a fascinating character. She has gumption, she gets things done but has no compassion for anyone but herself. Yet she never wastes any time on recriminations when wronged or when she falls victim to someone else's mistakes; she just moves on to the next task. She has a sense of responsibility, in a way she doesn't clearly understand, and that there are things greater than herself. It is the tension between her inner contradictions that hooks the reader into admiration and that brings about our empathy for her.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo",
            "This is one of my most favorite books. Well-written and full of passion and fun. It's intimidating at first due to the length, but you won't want to put it down!",
            "I bought this vintage copy of \"Gone With the Wind\" for my friend's birthday. She has always loved this story and I wanted to get her as close to an original copy of the book as I could. She loved the book, its history, and of course this classic story.",
            "I love the movie, but the book is so much better. Beautiful edition, even the print is stylish. Reading it was pure pleasure - it took me over a year, as I was sparing the book. My wholehearted recommendation to anyone who loved the movie.",

But I relayed this heart-felt literary love of mine to my other great hardcover friends, Tawney and Marie (one, a long-time member of the illustrious Corduroy Club/Manhattan chapter), and they immediately nodded and tilted their heads at my cerebral connection to this masterpiece. I hope that we all, including myself (after countless other reads, good and bad, achievements and not so much of sad, downwardly-glanced works, but I digress) revisit this delightful glance at a telling of history that few these days pause to the written word. I commend my fellow apprecianados. Life - let it be lived.",

            "I know some people are a little bit aprehensive when they are thinking about reading a classic, and rightly so, but although it is long and wordy (some parts can be very confusing and maybe read over a few times) it is one of the greatest romance stories ever written. I loved this book so much and have read it over and over again, and each time I discover little things that I've missed before. Definitely worth the amount of time it takes to read, also, try reading the sequel, Scarlett. I can't remember the author, but the style of Margaret Mitchell was immitated very well.",
            "Gone With the Wind is one of the most wonderful books I have ever read. It's a beautiful story of the civil war told from a southern belle's point of view. I had serious migranes reading it, since the print is so tiny but it was well worth it! I first read this at 13 and I would reccomend it to anybody!",
            "I love this book. I could read it over and over again. While it isn't very well written, it has the ability to take you there into the story and forget everything going on around you. It gives you a lot more detail then the movie, and makes you understand the characters more. You can really understand the motivation behind some of their actions.",
            "GWTW is undoubtedly an american classic for more reasons than one - sweeping storyline, strong characters and just the flow of simple lucid narrative prose that keeps you going from page to page with sustained interest (not an easy job if it is 700 pages!). I read it a few times when i was young, just fell in love with the movie and it is part of my library collection as well. I still enjoy the color and splendor and perky dialogue although the book is too long to read again with other reasons too.As i grew i figured out what was missing underneath the sentiments we have for it. There is not one word against racism or intolerance or suffering undergone by others during those times. Yes the south lost it all but times and lives change, some cruelly others more slowly with time - it is a natural order of things to change and intolerant lifestyles definitely have to. Lot of people have a longing for good times gone, but it needs to be laced with feelings for what caused it to happen and does not automatically mean bad times have come. I would think hidden beneath the huge popularity of the book so many years after it was made is partly love for simpler times but a lot of guilt for simplistic and intolerant ways of the past that were hidden by economic prosperity and picture postcard lifestyles.",
            "I have watched the movie a zillion times. So since I liked the movie so much I thought I would read the book too. I was amazed how much better the book was than the movie. It goes into great detail and you get the entire story. And since I live in Georgia I'm learning about my culture. And I also found out that not all folks who owned slaves were cruel to them. Actually some of their owners were good to them. And also I fell in love with all the characters. I hate Scarlett but yet I love her too. She is like me in a lot of ways. We are both selfish and spoiled. And we both let our conscious get the best of us. I recommend this book to everyone. It is amazing. I never read a book before until now. I can never put it down. I have now read 4 times and gets better each time. It's nothing like the movie. It's far better!",
            "Gone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell, is a captivating book about the southern way of life in the 1860s. Scarlett O'Hara, the main character in the book, is a young, outspoken girl for her times who lives on a big plantation, Tara. Gone With the Wind goes through the tough times of the Civil War. Scarlett wants a man that she can't have, Ashley Wilkes. She ends up marrying Ashley's cousin, Charles Hamilton, just to spite Ashley, but Charles died in war two months later. She found out she was pregnant with his child and named him after Charles's troop leader, Wade Hampton Hamilton. Scarlett waited awhile before she married her sister's beau, Frank Kennedy. She had a baby girl with him also, Ella. Frank was killed while attempting to kill the carpetbaggers who attacked Scarlett on the way to the lumber mill that they owned. She immediately married Rhett Butler, a urbane man that everyone loves to hate. She has yet another child with him, Bonnie Blue. I would recommed the book Gone With the Wind to anyone because its a twist of romance and survival.",
            "Almost everyone had heard of the beautiful Scarlett O'Hara and the way she can make men weep. The book, Gone with the Wind, though enthralling through 1,022 of it's pages, with it's can't-put-this-book-down events, unexpected turns, tragedies and historical content, has an, in my opinion, very unsatisfactory ending. According to some, it's &quot;The greatest love story of our time. Maybe it is, but the conclusion to the love triangle of Rhett, Ashley and Scarlett was left off as if it were not the end, but the beginning. I suppose it could be argued that you should use your imagination, and that the author wanted to escape those cliche of the studly man living happily ever after with the beautiful damsel but the last two pages left me wanting more. However, if you're the type of person who can deal with not-really-the-end endings, I would really recommend this book. Although it has maybe, an overabundance of pages, Scarlett's life takes many unexpected turns and you sometimes you get so enraptured in the excitement and tragedy that you find that you've read several pages and not even realized it. This book is also full of historical information about the civil war, looking at it from the very different perspective of the women of the south. Margate Mitchell has a way of writing that always keeps you guessing and feed you words of wisdom to live by. Almost like one really long tragic soap opera.",
            "Of course I love GWTW. I have read it at least a hundred times and it never fails to capture me. However, I want to make it clear to those who have children who wish to read GWTW, or if you are a young person yourself, that this is a novel which glorifies the ideals of the 'old south'. And that 'old south' so dearly loved and cherished by the characters of the book is one built with the sweat and blood of thousands of African Americans, and not those who reaped the benefits of slavery. By all means, enjoy this book for its romanticism. However, I think it is imperative that such misguided idealism and blatent cruelty must be treated as such and explained to those who are still rather impressionable.",
            "Gone with the Wind changed my point of veiw on the Civil War and how hard women worked and tried to be ladies. Scarlett worked hard to prevent Tara from being taken away and preventing hunger of her family. My point on the Civil War was southerners were terrible people but GWTW changed changed all that, most people treated their &quot;workers&quot; or slaves as part of the family and were happy. It was the yankee's who were terrible the wouldn't let the south be they had to torture them. The story is very good and if you haaven't read it YOU MUST READ IT.",
            "This book is a definite YES! It's exciting and it keeps you on the egde of your seat. It's so hard to put down! Scarlett and Rhett are such believeable characters and this is definitely the BEST book ever written. I strongly suggest you purchase it or check it out. This is a super book. It gives an exellent portrayal of the south before and after the war. It gives you the south's point of view. I would give it 10000000000000000000 stars!",
            "I absolutly loved GWTW! I loved the way Rhett acted towards Scarlett. In the beginning the way Mrs. Mitchell describes Scarlett is very good and gives you a good idea of the way Scarlett is. Rhett was my favorite character because he was so dashing and handsome. He also was kind and sweet you just couldn't tell most of the time, He was so funny when he was with Scarlett and how he hid his love for her made me sad. Scarlett was really a mean person most of the time, she was selfish and creul to the people around her. It made me mad the way she thought about Melanie, and how she used men to get money or revenge. Ashley was one of my least favorite characters, he was so unrealistic! The Tarleton twins were some of my favorites, they were vivacious and funny and sweet to Scarlett in the time you read about them. I just don't understand how Scarlett could just give up everything she had grown up in to be rich. Its just not right. I loved the part of the story during Rhett's and Scarlett's honeymoon! They were so happy! Bonnie was so like Scarlett it was unbelievable. You could understand why all the people and Rhett and even Scarlett loved her so! But how could she just send Wade and Ella away to Tara that way without any feeling about it. You could totally relate to the characters in the story, it on numerous times made me laugh, cry, mad, and jump for joy! I loved it!",
            "The minute I began this book, it was my all-time favorite. I had just turned eleven when I read it, and a lot of people thought it would be way over my head, but it wasn't. I read it in five days, that's about 205 pages a day. The instant I began reading it, Margaret Mitchell was my favorite author and GWTW was my favorite book. It is totally unsurpassed. It is and will remain a classic forever. Scarlett &amp; Rhett were very realistic, as were the other characters. I've read it several times. Every time I read it, I cry at the end, and at other various places in the book. There are no words that could ever possibly describe how spectacular, wonderful, magnificent, this book is. It is totallu unforgettable. If you read this book and didn't like it, there's something the matter with you, because it's totally lovable. It's impossible not to like it. I couldn't put it down the entire time I was reading. I took it everywhere with me. When I was done, I searched everywhere for the sequel, SCARLETT. I had to wait almost a week before it came in and I was dying to know what happened the entire time. I couldn't sleep some nights, for worrying about how things would turn out. I've been trying to get all my friends to read this great book. Some of them are actually thinking about it. There is just nothing else to say about a book as great as this one.",
            "Long book, and it hurts your eyes to read it, but it is well worth reading. So often we hear of the north's view of the war, and now we see it through the strong southern belle, Scarlett. Scarlett isn't nice, in fact she's very down to earth and reflects the flaws as well as the compliments women today share. She is spirited and willing to risk it all to never go hungry again, after feeling the poverty and hunger once Sherman swept through. Unlike many southerners, she realized that the past is gone with the Wind and she must break ties with society in order to stay strong, alive, and comfortable.",
            "One of the best books and best movies ever is Gone witht he wind. I have seen the movie lots and decided to read the book and the book is as good as the movie. The book and movie are almost the same butt he movie dosent include some of Scarletts children born before rhett. I loved the way the book is written and it's characters are classics. The only thing is the book is long a little to long at times but still it's a great read.",
            "\"Gone with the Wind\" by Margaret Mitchell is one of my favorite books of all time. Scarlet O'Hara, the foolish southern belle is in love with Ashley Wilkes, a scholar who won't have anything to do with her. To rebel, she marries his fianc&eacute;e' s brother and when the war breaks out, it turns ugly. She is then forced to move to Atlanta to her husband's house. In Atlanta, Georgia during the Civil War things aren't easy. It is hot and sandy. The sticky humidity is horrible to live in yet the feeling of \"home\" is evident everywhere. There are always barbecues and lazy afternoons up till the war. The south is mostly cotton fields, with little factories while the north is full of manufacturing. Things don't look too good for the south when the war breaks out and to make everything worse, the ports are soon closed off. All too soon Scarlet feels the bitterness of war as her childhood friends die for a losing cause. When she finds Atlanta being attacked by General Sherman she must flee for safety and there is nowhere to go.This story is about a girl who has been spoiled her entire life and then must learn to do things on her own. She faces the fact that she can't have everything and that she has to make sacrifices. Her whole life she has been the brat that depends on everyone else so she can't do anything on her own. She is blinded by her own insolence to the truth that nothing is fair. Sweet Melanie, her sister in law is kind to her and is too sweet hearted to see the wrong in anyone; she doesn't see how corrupt Scarlet' s mind is. She is always on Scarlet' s side despite the horrible things that she does. Scandalous Rhett Butler loves Scarlet for her foul heart and chases her throughout the whole book. Rhett has a history for doing unthinkable things to girls. (Unthinkable at the time; refusing to marry a girl he courted, publicly kissing, etc.) Everyone despises him for making a profit off of the war. All proper people support the failing cause and Rhett makes fun of them. He is a businessman, so nothing is personal till he meets Scarlet. As time progresses, Scarlet comes to realize the damage that she has done with her being wicked to everyone. She literally is and was a spoiled brat. Her suffering teaches her a lesson that we all should learn.If you love historical fiction with a little romance, this book is perfect for you. Scarlet is the perfect Southern belle who is incredible to read about. How she attracts men with her charm and little helpless acts is unbelievable. She is used to having slaves serve her and she treats them with little or no respect until she needs them. You cannot stop thinking about how much you would hate Scarlet if she was real, but you can't stop feeling sorry for her and you want to help her to realize how stupid she is.In this book you have a look at how the south was before and after the Civil War. They were still people with feelings, not horrible people who were wicked. You fall in love with the chivalry and way of life. You also realize how wrong slavery was. Even they knew it was wrong, they just couldn't imagine life without the slave labor. I think that the book is written well, you see why people did things and the reasoning behind their actions. I didn't always agree with what Scarlet did, but I knew why she did things. The book is very interesting and I couldn't put it down at all. I certainly would recommend it to just about anyone. I certainly understand the era better now. The book got me interested in other books about the war and now I can see why people felt the way they did. I can see the good and bad in slavery. I feel that lack of education on the issue is what caused such disastrous effects.Emily Norrod",
            "I had seen the movie and while I liked it, I HATED Scarlet. O.k. she's not my new best friend, but I understand her so much more now! And although I knew what was coming, I still cried in certain parts. By the time I closed the book, I thought if Scarlet didn't get Rhett, I would just die! Excellent book! If you haven't read it, pick it up!",
            "This a fabulous book. I think it is much better than the movie. A must for anyone, who loves to read. It is prefect for history fans. I have read and re-read this book many times. It is one of my favorites. It is set in the Civil War era. It is about Scalett O'Hara and Rhett Bulter. It was later made into a movie, starring Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable. Scallet is very independent women, who is famous for her green eyes, and her red hair, that explains her fiery temper. who first gets married to Charles Hamiltion. He's sister is Melanie, who becomes the wife of Ashley, the man, Scarlett wants but can never have. She has a a son, Wade, with Charles. Then she keeps her family together,--anyway she can. She even kills a Yankee. Then she marrys Frank Kenndy, to pay the taxes on Tara. She has a daughter, Ella, with him. He dies while having to Klu Klux Klan. She marrys Rhett. The have a fiery romance. They have a daughter, that Rhett names Bonnie Blue Butler, because her eyes were as blue as the Bonnie Blue Flag. This book closes with Scarlett pronouncing the famous words, \"After all, tomorrow is another day!\"",
            "I loved this book. Very dramatic, great story. However, not having ever seen the movie or read the book, I was expecting a love story. Isn't it called the best love story of our time? They never fell in love! However disappointed, the book was great, well written, a great story. . . not a love story.",
            "My paper back is barely going to withstand another reading since I have nearly worn it out. I actually read the book before seeing the movie. I was very disappointed! The movie made Scarlett seem so evil, but in the book she depicted more as a strong woman who did what she had to do to survive. The only thing that would be better than reading this book again, would be to have the audio version so I could listen to it in the car.",
            "I think that Gone with the wind is the best book ever written the movie is a winner to . I love how it informs you of everything that is going on. You go through the whole book like will Scarlett and Redett get together or will they stay together will Scarlett finally get Ashely. Will they survive the war. Who will live and who will die. You read through the tragides and the good times . I give Gone with the Wind and will argue with anyone who differs.",
            "this novel is coming from others generations for me, at first my mother read it and loved it so now i became interested in reading to, i hope it`s cool because i will spend a long time reading and end up bored will be terible.",
            "This edition is literally missing the part where Bonnie dies! There are no pages missing, just the material. Horrific. I threw it out.",
            "Gone With the Wind is the realization of an author's dream - to tell an American story of American attitudes in a deceptively treacherous society that became completely uprooted during an extended period of political turmoil in the United States. The characters are beautifully developed, the flavor of the period is flawlessly interwoven with the stories of the characters' lives, and we cling to each minor triumph and defeat as Mitchell works her way through this huge book. This is one book that you will want to read several times.",
            "As the ratings show, this book is accepted by many people to be the best book ever written, and I must agree. It has been a source of strength for me in hard times, and it guided me towards my love of writing.",
            "This is undoubtably one of the greatest, most gripping stories ever written. At first it's hard to get into, but- once Scarlett makes up her mind there's no stopping her and the adventure starts. Charles and Melly Hamilton, Ashley Wilkes, Aunt Pittypat and most of all Rhett Butler send Scarlett flying into confusion. With the war raging all around her, trying to support her family and friends, and trying to understand Rhett, Scarlett lives through a time of hardships and scorn, and bears it stubbornly. This book was gripping to the end, and left me thinking &quot;What happens next? You have to tell me! I just have to know!&quot; I am definitely going to read the sequel to this. Anyone who likes thrilling advinture, romance, and fiery heroines will love this book.",
            "This book is for those people who can't stand when a good book to come to an end. Also for those who like romance and loved the movie. You don't have to have seen the movie though to enjoy the book.",
            "I can't help admiring! The greatest creation of gifted author. Characters are picted so vividly! Scarlett seems nothing but spoilt chiled, and Rhett is a real Man, real Gentlemen - one you can trust. They live though Civil War, they learn to love, understand and forgive each other. I've read this book about 20 times and now I am looking for any chance to read it in English. Don&quot;t you think now that it is worth reading?",
            "I have read this book twice and each time it's as if I'm reading it for the first time. I loved both the book and the movie. The story is very passionate and expresses the powers of love. Rhett is the kind of person any woman wouldn't mind being married to.",
            "My mother read this book when she was 13. I read it when I was 13. I don't have a daughter, but if I did, I'd surely present her with a copy of this when she reached &quot;the age&quot;. Has your daughter read it? Don't settle for just the movie (although that's wonderful, too)! Read it!",
            "Truly amazing. I have read and reread this book several times. It never fails to amaze me how brilliantly Scarlett O'Hara is portrayed. And how such a spoiled brat could become so endeared by millions, including me. A first-rate love story that follows birth, death, and the horrid destruction of war. Please read this book, and cry for a lost civilization - the south.",
            "As this quote from the opening of the movie says, &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is a novel which truly brings us back to a different time, a time of southern gentlemen and hoop-skirted women. But if you've only seen the movie, you've only seen half the story. The novel describes the life of Scarlett O'Hara, southern belle, in much greater detail, and paints a vivid portrait of life and love in the Old South, and of the Civil War which destroyed it. This is an inspiring tale -- Scarlett is a strong-willed woman who faces the horrors of war and survives, rebuilding her life from nothing. &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is a wonderful story masterfully written. It truly gives us an insight into, as the movie says, &quot;a dream remembered, a civilization Gone With the Wind&quot;.",
            "I love &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;. When I was 14 my mother handed me the book and said it was the best book she had ever read. I looked at the size of the book and thought there was no way I would ever get through it. One day I began reading and I just couldn't stop. I was sad when I had finished it and asked myself the same question everyone does; what happend next? I gave the book to my best friend. She thought I was stupid, but since she had nothing better to do she read it. She soon learned I really wasn't stupid.",
            "&quot;GWTW&quot; is one of my favourite comfort books; &quot;War and Peace&quot; is another. They are similar in that they are sagas involving families whose lives are changed by war and how characters are affected by war. Some people fall to pieces and cannot contemplate a 'new' life where they have no place( Countess Rostova and Ashley Wilkes); while others find a hitherto unknown inner strength (Natalia Rostov and Scarlett). Margaret Mitchell took 10 years to write &quot;GWTW&quot;, thus starting the book in the '20's. She drew upon the stories that she had heard as a child from Civil War veterans and her own mother . Scarlett is the heroine of the book and there are very few scenes (as in the film) where she does not appear. &quot;War and Peace&quot; was also written over a long period of time. Tolstoy's work focuses on an exhaustive cast of characters, and places the reader in scenes domestic (&quot;peace&quot;) and foreign -the battlefields (&quot;war&quot;). Mitchell keeps her reader confined to Scarlett's side with third person references to battles and other factors of war. One could write a thesis ( as I felt I was beginning to!) on this topic. Let's just say that both are wonderful books; &quot;War and Peace&quot; is considered a &quot;Classic&quot;, while &quot;GWTW&quot; a classic example of historical fiction!",
            "Gone With The Wind is a superb book. It's story is so intresting. Margaret Mitchell wrote a wonderful book. I believe Gone With The Wind is my favorite book of all time and I can not wait to read it again. I love the way Mitchell describes Scarlett, Melanie, Rhett and Ashley. This is a literary gold!",
            "i just finished Gone With the Wind, and i love it. although it is heart-breaking, it's romantic and full of emotions. i like how the characters were develped; they all have their own traits. anyone who likes romance or has a lot of patience, i suggest you to read this book. (remember, you might cry like a baby when you finsih the book cuz it's........read it, and you'll know what i mean.)",
            "This book moved me because it was full of spontaneous adventure and valuable lessons. Margrett Mitchell not only wrote on romance and love, but also on the very real issues of a woman's place, jealousy, loyalty, and respect. Scarlett is the ideal stong and independent woman. She did not need men for their money and protection; she needed them for more suitable reasons like love and comfort. The entire novel was a lovely and inspiring story with twists of all kinds. I would highly recommend it to anyone in need of a wonderful read.",
            "Having lost count of how many times I have read Gone With the Wind, I continue to come back to it as, by far, my favorite book. Margaret Mitchell creates characters so vividly they seem real and sets them in a period of American history, the Civil War, that many of us are familiar with but from a perspective few can relate to, namely that of the Southern plantation family. It's very easy to create a vivid image of the characters, the context, the time in history, and how these factors mesh together to create situations that Scarlett O'hara can stuggle through and flourish in. Mitchell's creation of such characters as Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler allow you to question what exactly right and wrong really mean. These characters are selfish and crude, and reak of something, but throughout the book they continuously do extraordinary things for others. If you are in anyway a fan of historical novels, this is a must read.",
            "I thought the book was very good. I could not put it down. I absolutly hated the ending though. I wish I wouldn't of read the last.....150 pages. Oh well. I thought it was great anyway!!!",
            "I first read Gone With the Wind when I was fifteen . I read it again at twenty and have read it several times since. I am now forty years old and have read thousands of books and this book was and still is my all time favourite. there has never been a book so captivating , so romantic, so rebellious, so true to the south. Scarlett and Rhetts relationship is so full of fireworks it leaves the reader eagerly turning the page to see whats going to happen next. When I started a collection of all time classic books it was the first one I put on the bookshelf. I hope every young reader gets the chance to this fabulous novel.",
            "When Margret Mitchell wrote Gone With The Wind she probably never realized what an amazing story she began. The book combines romance with adventure. Scarlett O'Hara will always be remembered as one of the greatest characters of all time for her Irish ways and charming beauty.",
            "I read this book three years ago, but I couldn't help but write this review now. This book goes far beyond what humanly words can possibly say. This book sparked so many emotions in me, I thought I would die. Even at a few hundred pages left to experience, I was aching because it was coming to a close so fast. I can't count the number of times I cried, and how long I cried at the end. I didn't want to let go of the enchanting story, but I could never, ever read it again. This book truly touched me, and I'm saddened by the loss of this magnificent author. There'll never be another. God Bless You Miss Mitchell.",
            "Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind is my absolute favorite book. I enjoy books that have deeper meaning and make you think, but although this book lacks one it's a masterpiece all the same. Read it for the story and lose yourself in the Old South. P.S. The movie was great, but the book goes into much more detail and causes one to be much more drawn to the heroine.",
            "Let me make a simple statement: This novel is a perfect interpretation of the Antebellum bourgeousie South. Margaret Mitchell was born in the early 1900s and therefore the stories she heard, the ones that inspired this novel, were admittedly a bit skewed.HOWEVER, there is a lot of truth to Gone with the Wind, whether people like it or not, and beyond that, this novel is probably the perfect love story because it is so heartbreaking and so imperfectly human. Whether or not you agree with the portrayal of slavery, the Civil War, the Reconstruction, etc. that this novel presents, it is unfair to dismiss the greatness of Gone with the Wind. You can read all the Twain, Faulkner, Fitzgerald that you like, but until you have read this book, you do not have the full picture of American literature.",
            "Epic. Heart-rendering. Encouraging. I don't know where to start.If you have not read this book, I highly recommend it. If you have already read it, treat yourself to another read.\"Gone with the Wind\" is a book that I have read annually from the time I was a teenager. The characters keep calling me back. The story reaches out and grabs me. So, I go back every year for a visit with the characters who seem so real and present to me.What speaks to me the most is Scarlett, herself. Despite hardship, she provides for the people around her. She is determined. Scarlett is taught from childhood that who she is fundamentally is wrong and she should try to be someone else...and she does try for a while. (Does this seems familiar to any of us ladies today?) Only Rhett sees her for her true self and appreciates it. Despite being a renegade, he keeps his word, loves Scarlett and Bonnie (their daughter) honestly and deeply, while carelessly providing luxuries and lavishing them with attention. A real man!!!!! Mitchell's characters are complex, true, and touching.Also, Mitchell brings the battles of the American Civil War to life. The battles are explained in a style that is compelling and breath-taking.Scarlett and Rhett are people who are real and live life with passion and strength. If you want to meet Scarlett or flirt with Rhett, all you have to do is open the book and read as the past come to life.Happy reading!",
            "Gone with the Wind is one of the best books ever written, maybe the best.I can not even express how much I love this book.Many people disregard Gone With the Wind as a just a lenthy romance, but this is NOT what it is. Gone with the wind is SO much more than a romance. It is, for one, a book about the Civil War from the Southern people's perspective. This book gives the reader a brand new perspective on the Civil War and it is refreshingly NOT like all the other mundane Civil War books. It is full of history, but there is never a boring moment: Margret Mitchell is a brilliant writer whose beautiful and exciting descriptions, livily dialoge and none-stop story keep the book engrossing and never boring. I couldn't put it down!Again, Gone with the WInd is not just a romance, as I said, it is a refreshing Civil War book; but it is not only that. Gone with the wind has many suspensful, dangerous, and sometimes violent moments, such as The Burning of Atlanta or the event when Scarlett shoots a Yankee invader.The characters of GWTW are immortal. Each character is so beloved to so many readers, and there is a good reason why. Every character has his own fascinating personality. Every type of person, from selfish to greedy to tragic to stupid to controlling to timid to utterly kind is expressed in the book's countless engrossing characters.The story line is also wonderful. It is very complex but never confusing; it has such a good main plot and so many intriuging sub-plots.For the reasons I have attempted to state above and for so many more, Gone with the Wind is a beloved American Classic that has endured and will endure for many years to come.Whether are a man or woman, girl or boy, old or young, READ THIS BOOK!You will not regret it.And it just may be, that after you have entered the world of Gone with the Wind, you will find in it a new favorite that is worth reading over and over again.",
            "Margaret Mitchell was a genius. This book is so detailed and interesting it is hard to describe. Do not judge it by the movie. It is a very accurate portrayal of life before, during and after the War Between the States, in the South. Scarlett was not always an admirable character, but she was not boring.",
            "The love story is very well known and beautiful. If you want a great romance you won't be disappointed.However, the story behind the romance is what really made this book wonderful for me. It questioned what happens to people when society changes. What's great is that it shows many people's responses to the change. It reminded me of Chinua Achebe's THINGS FALL APART.The characterizations and descriptions are wonderful. I found this book to be very engaging and real. I would recommend it to anyone.",
            "Most will have seen the movie before ever considering reading this remarkable book. The \"bones\" of the movie are in the book, but the novel has so many more characters and details that it really makes for an excellent read. More background on Scarlett and the others and everything is much more fleshed out. Great.",
            "LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the book! What an amazing story line. It is entertaining, heart pounding at times, and very real. You can relate to the characters at times and hate them all at the same time. I think anyone will be happy to read this book and not feel like it was a waste of time. Happy Reading!!!",
            "This is one of my favorite books. Don't get me wrong, it has its faults - sometimes too-slow pacing, and deeply embedded racism to name a few. But we don't love things because they are perfect, or because of their morality. We love them because they touch us.As this book touched me.How can I explain the affecting emotion aroused in me by stubborn, foolish, sensible fiery Scarlett? Or the adoration of tough, roguish Rhett? Or the kinship I felt with the both of them? By that last, perhaps.This book is a historical romance, member of a genre known for its cliches. But it is no Harlequin. I have read enough of that genre, and am not a fan. This book is part of a genre known for crappiness, yet the romance between Rhett and Scarlett is real, not contrived, and feels real. Mitchell has accomplished what many have tried and failed to do, here: to write a strong romance novel that even readers of the non-sappy sort can enjoy.And the racism, that, too, has a purpose, though I doubt Mitchell intended it insomuch as it just was, because she herself was racist. A lot of historical novels (bad ones, at least) take characters from certain places and times, and make them into MODERN people, with MODERN values, misunderstood and inexplicably ahead of the times. Scarlett is a southern belle in the civil war south. This is the setting of the novel. Does she 'break the rules' at times? Yes. But she does not do it on every single count, and any messages thus conveyed are not overtly preachy. Mitchell has created something that is simultaneously believable, and yet transcendent, sometimes heroic, and larger-than life.",
            "I am only 11 years old. Still, no one stopped me from reading the classic, Gone With the Wind. I encourage myself. When I started reading the book, I got so caught into Scarlett, Ashley WIlkes, Melanie, and Rhett Butler, that I felt as if I were living with them as well! When I got to the end of the book, I felt as if Margaret Mitchell had left out something very valuable, like she hadn't really meant to publish the un-finished book! I am getting very crazy about Gone With the Wind, and it's truly the first book that I can ever say sincerely that was my \"Favorite book\" ever! For anyone who thinks Gone With the Wind's words are too small, or that the book is too \"mushy and gushy for us,\" it's not! It's a nice, sad romance novel that I shall remember forever. Please read it. I am currently asking for the book, in hardcover original edition, for my birthday.",
            "I LOVE THIS BOOK!! Rhett Butler is one of the best characters when it comes to writing and so is Melanie, and Scarlett. Mitchell outdid herself in this classic novel. I love the movie too, but the book is much better with so much more detail. Yes, Scarlett is a little whiny and selfish and takes Rhett for granted, but I love her anyway! Ashley is a huge git, but you have to like a lot of the other characters inculding Aunt Pitty-pat and Melanie. This book is 5 Stars and nothing can change that. I hope Mitchell is smiling down from heaven when she sees us reading her book-because it is a true gem.",
            "My mother requested this book for Christmas. We had gone together to see the movie years ago and it is one of her favorite stories. I purchased the book for a Christmas gift for her and she loved it!",
            "If you've not read this book, you better start right now! An unsurpassable classic...doesn't get any better than this...enough said.",
            "Mch more interesting than the movie.There is more character development,you understand why some people did the thingsthat they did",
            "Have to have such a classic in your home library. Nice shape. Good service. Will be a nice re-read this winter.",
            "It has been a long time since I read GWTW and hated Scarlett. I reread it with an adult's perspective of hardships, tough knocks and suffering, and while I still don't like Scarlett, I've come away with a greater appreciation of the hardships of living in an occupied land, 19th century societal expectations of women in the U.S.; and the tumult of changing social norms from one century to the next. It is a fascinating read.",
            "I can't believe it took me this long to get around to this book. It is honestly the best book I ever read.",
            "I remember reading this book a long time ago because I liked the movie. The book is definitely better. It's a very long book, over a thousand pages but a good story about love and determination.",
            "I fell in love with the movie first, so I thought i would give the book a try. For those who loved the movie, the depth of the characters and complicated feelings it brings, the book is even better. I love that it gives insight into characters that the movie doesn't have a chance to expound on.I always finish the movie wanting just a little more. The book helps satisfy a bit of that. Even having seen the movie countless times, the book was still a page turner.Some are offended at the glorification of the south and the misrepresentation of slavery in the book. I don't think it's wrong to find the perspective represented as very idealistic. But maybe take it more as a book written from the warped view that some probably had about their relationships with their slaves. It really is about the end of a civilization and their entire way of life.",
            "It is a wonderful classic and I enjoy it so much I savor the time I get to read it. It goes so much faster on my kindle.",
            "This copy is pretty much what the First Edition looked like in 1936 and it's easy to see how it got to be so big. Not until The Godfather was published had there been so much interest in a book and its inevitable film version. Impresses to this day and you can see the masterwork the film's screenwriters performed in getting this sprawling story onto the screen. I think every American should read this through at least once.God help the pukes making movies in this era who think they need to \"reboot\" this story... Also, don't bother with the \"authorized\" sequels; the story stands on its own.",
            "While I admit to not being a fan of the romance genre, Mitchell's &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; towers above its imitators in style and substance. Set in the Atlanta area during the Civil War era, Mitchell's story exemplifies the proper writing of historical fiction, with painstaking accuracy of language, mannerisms, and morals. The war itself is also presented as it should be presented - in full color and with all its moral ambiguity, rather than the black-and-white presentation that so often is the norm in modern discourse.Mitchell's painting of southern culture and the all-encompassing war, however, serve only as the background for one of the most poignant love stories ever written. Following the life and loves of the willful Scarlett O'Hara, the work delves straight into the meaning and nature of love. Torn between her now-married childhood love, Ashley, and the outcast Rhett Butler, and in dogged pursuit of financial success after the devastating war, Scarlett lives a life of emotion and passion that few fictional characters have rivalled.Though this work is quite long, it is a very easy read. The style is light and brisk, the language uncomplicated except in the heavy dialect of the blacks, and the story compelling. &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; is a great book, a great movie, and perhaps the greatest love story ever told. Highly recommended.",
            "I began this novel in the 11th grade prepared to hate it to the core. Everything I knew about it made me expect a silly, eye-batting trip into a fairy tale world of the Old South with its impossibly virtuous ladies, its foppish gentleman and grinning content slaves, and I was actually looking forward to making fun of the characters, story and author.I could NOT have been more wrong about this novel. Margaret Mitchell, I salute you!This is to American letters what Les Miserables is to France, or War And Peace is to Russia. Nowhere else are characters like these to be found or is the human spirit portrayed as so unconquerable. I fell in love with this book. From its would-be detractor I became its most vocal champion. I was stunned over and over at how inutterably magnificent this contribution to literary greatness was. As one reads along about the lives of these larger than life men and women all set against the backdrop of the fall of an entire civilization, any sensitive person can only be compelled to acknowledge that there on the open page is a book that shall live in literary eternity.Of any work of fiction a person might feel compelled by \"duty\" to read at some point in a lifetime, Gone With The Wind deserves to be at the head of that list.",
            "This is a wonderful leatherette version, with a self ribbon place marker and a lovely gold dark gold and blue cover and heavy fine paper, with plenty of cloth fiber used in the making of the paper. This makes a better grade of paper only used in the best of books and stationary.They just don't make them like this any more!Chaska",
            "Gone with the Wind is a timeless, sweeping, epic masterpiece of American literature. It is the story of the South right before the Civil War, during the war, and the aftermath when Reconstruction began in the South. It is filled with drama, romance, tragedy, real characters with flaws, and I can see why this book won a Pulitzer Prize and why it continues to be a very popular book decades after it was first published in 1936.I don't need to go into a synopsis of the book, if anyone hasn't heard of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler, I'd be very surprised. If you have only seen the wonderful movie adaptation of the book, but have never read the book, I highly recommend you read the book. The movie doesn't capture the essence of the characters, the entirety of their personalities and motives behind certain actions and behaviors.I was captivated from the very first page. I can't describe exactly how or why, but Mitchell wrote in such a way that pulls you into the story. Her writing is simple and straightforward, and it touches you in a way that helps you relate to the characters and the world she wrote about. Her writing resonates with you, and keeps you reading. Her writing of the scenery and backdrop of the South, her depictions of the various characters, their motives, their thoughts, their innermost secrets that make them who they are. Mitchell brought this time period to life and causes you, the reader, to empathize with the characters and the struggles and upheaval they go through.Even though I know this story, how it unfolds and how it concludes, I couldn't turn the pages fast enough until I reached the very end. Scarlett O'Hara isn't the most sympathetic character you'll encounter, but as I gradually read her story, I found myself liking this character and rooting for her happily ever after, although you know she doesn't get that HEA in the end. I actually found the ending appropriate, it fits in with Scarlett's personality of a person who won't quit no matter what. She has seen the worst in life, and she remains stubborn in defeat that she can win back Rhett's love.Scarlett was a very selfish, manipulative, and cruel young woman, the only person she cared about was herself (with the exception of her mother, Ellen O'Hara, who she revered and respected and was the only woman she trusted). She was a simple person, not easily able to understand more serious and complex issues, which she usually shrugged off in a careless fashion as insignificant and unworthy of her time. She presented a facade of a lady of gentility to the world, all the while seething secretly inside at what she perceived as injustices against her or the unfairness of life if she didn't get her way. She was also willfully stubborn in her unrequited love for childhood friend, Ashley Wilkes, and it was quite sad to see her pine for a man who rejected her even though he did love her but was too cowardly to do anything about it.Despite her numerous character flaws, Scarlett had some admirable traits, such as her perseverance and flinty determination to survive. There were so many times where she was numb with weariness and feeling desolate at the heavy burden on her shoulders, but she would always put off her morose thoughts and say, \"I will think about it later\", and mentally force herself to take it one step at a time in order to stay sane and calm in a chaotic world. This was in contrast to her weak sisters who couldn't seem to comprehend that their old lifestyle had vanished forever and that a change was needed within themselves in order to survive. Scarlett, with her unladylike blunt honesty and very practical nature realizes this almost immediately. She was so unlike her tender and kind mother, Ellen, in almost every way except in one. Like her mother before her, she became the mistress of Tara, and in her newfound role she fills her mother's shoes in becoming what her family needed. Someone to look up to and lean upon for aid when needed.I found Scarlett a contradiction of sorts. She would look upon in contempt or disgust at those who depended on her, yet she would cast such thoughts aside in order to fulfill her duty to them as she couldn't abandon them. For her family because they *were* family and an O'Hara always helped family, and for Melanie, Ashley's wife, because of a promise. On the one hand she was a strong woman, strong in that she was able to survive the devastation of the South and show a courage of spirit in facing adversity and impossibility, but on the other hand, she was weak too. Weak in continuing in her girlhood, idealistic, puppy love for Ashley that blinded her to real, true lasting love with Rhett Butler who was her true soul mate. In some ways she was finally a woman, having the burden of responsibility of her family forcing her to mature, but in other ways, in her relationship with men, she was still a child. Of course, in the latter category she realizes too late what she knew instinctively all along, that Rhett Butler was the man for her and she had just been too immature, stubborn, and childish to see it clearly.Rhett Butler was the perfect match for fiery Scarlett. He was exactly like her, unscrupulous and looking to number one first (although, he did have his gentlemanly and kind moments beneath the veneer of mockery and sardonic amusement). Unlike Scarlett, he didn't pretend to be what he was not. He was no refined Southern gentleman and he took perverse pleasure in flaunting this in subtle ways. He is basically Scarlett in masculine form, only more intelligent.Some of my favorite moments of the book were the scenes with Rhett and Scarlett sparring with the other. It was amusing to see Rhett get the upper-hand over Scarlett every time. His witty quips most times went completely over her head, as she wasn't as clever as he, but that made it all the more amusing to see Scarlett finally meet her match in Rhett. I laughed aloud several times as I read Scarlett getting frustrated and upset stating he was no gentleman, only to see him laugh at her and agree with her he wasn't. Other scenes I enjoyed reading was the scenes back at Tara after she fled Atlanta, where you are witness to the transformation of Scarlett the Southern belle to Scarlett the survivor as she toiled in the cotton fields in Tara and tried to put food on the table for her family.I thought it was quite saddening to read about the delusions people in the South had regarding the war. The characters in Atlanta, such as Mrs. Merriweather or Dr. Meade, with their desperate, futile hope, and optimism that the South would prevail was sad to read about. Defiant to the end, in their naive and stubborn pride they thought the South and \"the Cause\" they fought for would triumph no matter the cost. It was this hope they clung to even as Atlanta was under siege by the Union army. None would know (or wanted to admit to knowing), except those perceptive enough to see the truth, such as Rhett Butler or Ashley Wilkes, that the way of life the South enjoyed up to the war was dead and gone. An old world that wouldn't come back, even if they had won, as it was forever changed, and like the title of the book gone with the wind. This book was poignantly sorrowful in that regard, you get a brief glimpse into the South portrayed pre-war and then post-war, and you realize it was never to be the same again.Although this story is told from the perspective of a Southern woman and her story of surviving the war, I think one could say her personal story reflects on a larger scale the entire South's struggles to survive in a new and changed world. The scenes of the ruined and abandoned plantations, with their eerie tomb stillness, was described in very convincing detail, and I found myself with Scarlett mourning the lost world she loved and grew up in.I could keep on writing about the various aspects of this story that were enjoyable and what I thought, but this review would get very lengthy if I did! Let me say this: the book was wonderful. Just read it! You won't regret it, yes, it is quite a hefty book but this story is so engrossing, compelling, and captivating you won't even notice how long the book is.",
            "This is my favorite book of all time. Maay critics of today have harsh criticism for this book, but a book is not always ment to meet current day social standards, it is supposed to take you away and entertain you. This is exactly what GWTW does and quite superbly I may add. If you are looking for an enchanting story if survival, adventure, romance, and whimsy, than do not hesitate to buy this book.",
            "What can I add that has not already been said about this novel? It truly is one of the best novels ever written. I read over 75 books every year, many of them historical novels. I don't know why I waited so long to read this one, but I'm glad I finally did. And no, I haven't seen the movie. The characters were multi-dimensional and despite their often-displayed negative qualities, we keep hoping for them. They are more real and probably like ourselves than most of us would care to admit. Perhaps that is the real beauty of the story. We can see how selfish actions can lead to consequences without having to live through the pain ourselves. The style is easy to read and enjoyable to follow. And the backdrop of the Civil War and the early reconstruction period (from the South's point of view) is among the best I've ever run across. Despite its length, the book keeps you enthralled, every step of the way. This is one of those classics that you simply must read, not because you should, but because you will be so glad you did.",
            "When my mom brought this home, at first I thought I wouldn't understand it. I started the book because I had seen the motion picture and fell in love with all of the characters. Once I started I could NOT stop! I read in the shower, I read while I was brushing my teeth, I read late into the night when I was supposed to be sleeping. I am only eleven years old but I still hold Gone With the Wind a treasure to my heart. My favorite character was Melanie. I became Melanie for the couple of weeks that I read this book. I adored Ashley and admired Rhett Butler. I read with intent interest at Scarlett's luxurious life,I struggled through the Civil War. I felt the O'hara family's hunger too. Even though I am young,I say this book is up there with the best literature there is!",
            "This is the greatest romance ever written, and at over 1000 pages long, most people will finish it within days, reading it in bed, at the table, in the bathroom, in the car, on the way to the mailbox, just because you can't put it down, and every page is a page-turner. Fantastic dialogue, fantastic scenery, fantastic character development. You'll remember whole passages and be able to quote from it.",
            "Great book. A must read, though whether or not you like it is up to you. I've loved this book since I was fourteen, and I think it is one of the best novels to ever come out of America.It drives me crazy when people say this book is racist. Really? A book written by a southerner, closely related to former slave owners? Racist? NO! The book is written about a south that the people of the south say and believed in, and the characters are all people who fit into this setting. This wasn't a story about enlightenment and aboltionism. It was a story about a woman in the south and the Civil War and reconstruction through her eyes. Not your eyes. Not the eyes of the northern aboltionists. Not the eyes of a slave. It was shown through the eyes of half the population of the US at the time, and that people try to nullify these views is wrong. This is the way people thought and felt, and villifying all slave owners (many of whom grew up in that society and didn't know much better) is no better than making all negroes stupid. In the end, it's a work of fiction. A book. Reading and enjoying it doesn't make someone a racist, and I would hope that people would please stop saying that. Don't like the book? Don't read it. I, for one, would say that books like \"The Wind Done Gone\" is no less racist, though there will be hell to pay if someone actually says it out loud.",
            "The summer I was 15, between Junior High and High School, my mother recommended that I read this book. Of course I wasn't going to listen to HER...so I pouted around for a few days, and then one evening, afraid I was going to succumb to utter boredom, I picked it up.For the next week, I did nothing but read Gone with the Wind. I read it every waking moment, far into the night, first thing in the morning. I remember having a perpetual headache from eyestrain. I simply could not stop until the last page, when I burst into tears, and sobbed for what seemed like hours.The book has much the same effect on me now. Every few years, I read it cover to cover, even though I can quote key passages by heart by this time. So let me tell you a little bit about Gone with the Wind, the first thing being that it is not what you think it is. It's hard to compete with David O'Selznick here, even though he's dead, but I beg you to put the movie aside, and prepare yourself for sheer, satisfying, bosom-heaving pleasure. This was a thoroughly amazing book in the thirties, and it wears well. It is much more than the story of spoiled, willful Scarlet O'Hara and her deadly flirtations. Scarlet may have been the first feminist. Women in her day had no power whatsoever. Their entire lives were decided by convention: whom they should marry, what they should eat, where they should live, what they should wear. But Scarlet would have none of it. And the only way she could break free of convention was to use her wiles to flaunt it. She did--and it worked. She was and is my hero, selfish and vain as she was.On quite another level, this is the heartbreaking story of the War Between the States from the Southern point of view. As a teen who was raised in California, I had no clue about how the South felt about the War, and no way to find out. This book, silly as some may find it, taught me that there are two sides to any conflict, two equally powerful and opposing points of view that are tragically at odds. Sound familiar? Not much different than the Middle East today.Now a word about the book's purported racism. Yes, there are slaves in this book, and I am not going to presume to tell you not to resent or be angry about that fact. But considering the time in which she lived, I think that Margaret Mitchell tried to deal with the issue of slavery as best she could. The slaves in the book are not the simpering fools of the movie. They are portrayed with as much dignity as I think Mitchell could manage when considering that there was no way she could condone OR ignore that slavery was a fact during the Civil War. Mammy is not a caricature in the book, Prissy is a much more sympathetic young woman, and the other slaves are portrayed as thinking, feeling, human beings.The Emancipation is not regretted, and is seen from the freed slaves' point of view as much as possible. That having been said, I am not advocating this book as something it is not. It is not an abolitionist work, and it is not anti-slavery per se. It is not anything more than phenomenally well-written story with a lot of truly interesting historical information about the 1860s and beyond.Gone with the Wind is the story of a lifetime, not the caliber of War and Peace, but for its time, incredibly good reading. Summer is almost upon us. This is a perfect time to sit under a magnolia tree with a mint julep and treat yourself to an old-fashioned story you'll never forget.",
            "My stepmom collects all things Gone With The Wind so this was a perfect gift for her at a decent price. The book came in its own case and did not have a scratch or mark of any kind on it. My stepmom loved her perfect present and do did my pocketbook.",
            "I have always loved Gone With the Wind. I found this edition here on Amazon and had my husband give it to me for Christmas. It is lovely. Book was in really good condition, too.",
            "The story begins with Scarlett O'Hara flirting outside her home with the Tarleton twins. The inciting incident was evident when Scarlett finds out that her beloved Ashley Wilkes is marrying that dreadful Melanie. The entire book spans the time of the Civil War and some reconstruction era. Gone with the Wind is a brilliant epic because it's about a love triangle and a young woman who is trying to find her place in the world. The setting is quite vivid, and if you live in the south, you know the heat and the vermillion sky. Of course, to read the book, even the name conjures up the images of Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable. The book itself, a classic indeed, isn't special. The words are verbose and at times rather pretentious. What makes this story amazing are the memorable characters.Scarlett O'Hara is the most obnoxious human being ever, but she's sympathetic. Thebook is at least honest in that it shows her motives. While other characters in the bookmisinterpret her greed and manipulation as strength, the reader knows Scarlett is quite selfish and egocentric. We see her continuous struggle with what society tells her and what makes perfect sense. The reader applauds her tenacity and refusal to accept hardships. Of course, in the book she's only 16.Rhett Butler is also rather vile as a womanizing, selfish renegade with little regard for the ways of high society. He's an older man by the standards of the 1860s at 27. What makes him so special is that he makes it quite clear that he can have sex any woman he wants, but he doesn't want to have mindless sex.He wants someone that interests him, can think for themselves, and he wants their attention. This person is Scarlett. Rhett is a man who knows what he wants. Of course, it's clear to the reader his acts of kindness aren't kindness but manipulated ways to get a hold of Scarlett.Ashley is the contrast to Rhett, a moral and kind man who is drawn to Scarlett but he loves Melanie. Ashley loves the idea of history, literature, and high society. Melanie is Scarlett's contrast. While everyone hates Scarlett, Melanie loves her and that drives Scarlett nuts.At the end of the book, the characters are the most memorable part of the book and considered a classic.",
            "There are few adjectives left, that hasn't been used to describe this book. Someone has written, that all Americans, should read this book, while they still can. The shipping was excellent and the book, is in better condition than described,and at very reasonable rates, an easy 5 Star Rating.",
            "I ordered this book due to the fact that my other one got destroyed....little siblings lol. The book cover is different from the one in the picture. The pic showed a blue cover with a gold like color for the title. The cover on the book I now have is of a man (Rhett) holding a women (Scarlett in his arms.. The book arrived a few weeks after having ordered it but thats ok. I wasn't about to allow my bookshelf to live out its life w/o having one of America's best classics on it. The book arrived in good condition and Im happy:)",
            "Bought this as a request for a friend who had seen the movie and wanted to have the book as part of her Margaret Mitchell collection. Buying from Amazon guaranteed that the item was shipped on time, well packaged and equally was budget friendly.",
            "I read this book in its entirety when I was 13 or 14, and of course I know far more now than I did then. I feel that if you can read this book with its historical context in mind and just appreciate it as a period piece and an exciting story, you'll be fine.I was thinking today about the fact that I read this book shortly after I read Little Women, the story of the March sisters whose dad was fighting the Civil War as a soldier for the Union. The contrast is great because while Alcott's book is filled with so many upstanding citizen types, Mitchell's story is peppered with the roguish Rhett Butler, the self-centered Scarlett, and an assortment of amoral characters. A few stand out as worthy of admiration--Melanie of course, Scarlett's mother, and Scarlett's beloved Mammy.I don't recall this book with the sentimentality that I hold for a simpler classic, such as Little Women. I loved the excitement, the adventure, the ironies. It thrilled me when Scarlett delivered Melanie's baby all by herself and when she said, \"As God as my witness, I'll never be hungry again,\" and proceeded to pick cotton in the fields like a \"common field hand\" as I think she put it. Her crush on Ashley thrilled me, and their long-awaited kiss was well worth waiting for! Somehow I couldn't quite cotton to the roguish, worldly Rhett and so their romance didn't thrill me, but nevertheless I was crushed when he abandoned her at the end. I remember asking my mom, \"Why?\" I just didn't understand why he couldn't have forgiven someone he supposedly loved so much.Just as in Little Women, I loved hearing about the fashions and balls. I tried to imagine what it would have been like to have been as popular as Scarlett! The obsession with thinness, so similar to our world with all the Jennifer Anistons today, interested me greatly. Imagine a 17-inch waist!I doubt whether I understood fully why she kicked Rhett out of her bedroom when she discovered that her waist measured a full 20 inches, leading her to the decision to stop having babies after Bonnie. And I'm embarrassed to admit that I thought Bonnie was a spoiled little girl, a miniature Scarlett, and I didn't cry when she died. But I cried when Melanie died, the woman who Scarlett had looked down upon all her life, only to finally realize that she was a great person.So much drama, so much excitement--wasn't it Melanie who suggested to Scarlett that they search the Union soldier's pockets after Scarlett had killed him when he entered Tara? I'm not sure but I remember that scene vividly from both the book and the movie when they realized that they'd both be raped by the home invader if they didn't do something fast!When I read this book as a young teen, I'd never read anything quite so adventurous or sophisticated. I'd never even seen the term \"sexual intercourse\" in print before, and now I was reading that Scarlett liked kissing, but marital relations didn't really appeal to her. My first adult book and I ate it up.If you can get past your hatred for the glamourization of slavery and see this book as a story from history, it's quite a fascinating tale. I mean who else but Scarlett O'Hara would fashion a dress from drapes and go to visit Rhett in jail in the hope of seducing him and achieving financial security for her and her family. Forgive me, but I can't help but picture Carol Burnett doing a skit as Scarlett, wearing the drapes, rod and all!This book probably deserves five stars just because it's a grand epic, but I need more of a love story, more inspiration than I found here. When the final words of a book are, \"Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn,\" this is too harsh for me.",
            "I fell in love with Gone With The Wind at age 14 when my mother gave me a copy. Now--many decades and books later--it is still my favorite book ever. I realize that it may seem dated to 21st century readers. But it was written in the mid-1930s, when society was vastly different. No other book has ever captured my imagination like GWTW. And Scarlett O'Hara Hamilton Kennedy Butler is hands-down my all-time favorite character. Yes, she was vain and selfish and willful, and spent years deluding herself about Ashley Wilkes. But she was also very brave and intelligent (and beautiful). While the rest of her family sat back bemoaning the past, Scarlett literally saved Tara. In my opinion, she was a surprisingly modern woman who, unfortunately, was ahead of her time. She lived in an era when strong, independent women were not acknowledged or respected... and for this, she paid a high price.Even though I loved Vivien Leigh's portrayal of Scarlett, I much prefer the book over the movie. GWTW is a book that can be revisited over and over again. I know I'll never get tired of reading it.",
            "Probably one of the very greatest fiction books of all time. Ms. Mitchell wrote a classic here with all the details of the Civil War enmeshed with Scarlett O'Hara and her tempetuous personality. Made into the movie in 1939 (and won the Best Picture Oscar that year), the book offers no disappointments. A true classic!",
            "I love Gone with the Wind it is my all time favorite book and movie. I found the movie edition on Amazon and just had to get it. The binding is coming off and I have to find someone who can fix it. But it is a great addition to my book collection. I am actually afraid to read it. It is sitting next to my copy of Rebecca of Sunnybrooke Farm movie edition book.",
            "Great condition. I am really enjoying it. Can't believe it took me 68 years to finally read this.",
            "It was a very loooong book but really good! Usually with long books there's always a part that drags on forever but it never felt that way with this book. It always kept my interest and the ending was different and not at all what I expected, which is a good thing.",
            "I have always been a lover of the film, but I am so glad I finally read this book. It was packed with fascinating history and a wonderful set of characters. It is a long book, but definitely worth the effort! Its epic story and beautifully written dialogue paint a picture of the Confederacy, its fall and Reconstruction. This is a story of survival and the pure gumption it takes to get ahead. I recommend this book to anyone who likes a good read!",
            "I saw the movie GWTW as a kid, but the memory faded over time. I never thought to read the book, but took it out of the library on audio CD. What a wonderful, memorable, amazing book. Scarlett, Wrett, Ashley and Melanie are extraordinary portraits, and anyone interested in US history will find much to enjoy with the story set against the Civil War.Linda Stephens audio CD narration is spot-on, painting a nuanced compelling portrait of the characters and story.So worth going beyond the film!",
            "I wish Margaret Mitchell had written more than one book. She was a talented writer and one of the best story tellers. Love her vivid description of war scenes and dialogues. Truly a classic, a great piece of American literature!",
            "I love this book. I love these characters. I love how it's 1,000 pages long, so you don't have to leave the amazing world depicted too soon. I love how you can curl up with this book and read it for hours on end and never come to the last page. It's so completely absorbing, so real and life-like, so undeniably painted, that it's more than classic. It's a masterpiece. I asked for this book for my Confirmation present, and I will cherish it and show it to my children and my children's children. I hope to God that this book is never forgotten. It is simply beautiful and romantic.",
            "I really enjoyed reading this long novel and have to say that I was sad when it was over. Aside from being very easy to read and an interesting story line, the settings in rural Georgia and Atlanta during the civil war provide a realistic historical feel that you don't get from reading history books on the civil war. I have since read a history book on Sherman's march to the sea and realize that the general descriptions in Gone With The Wind about what happened to the residents of Georgia are true. Whether you want a more personal insight into what life was like during the Civil War in the south, or just a really enjoyable book to read, I would highly recommend Gone With The Wind. Also, ignore some of the book covers that make this book look like a love story, it is a book of equal interest to men and women in my opinion.",
            "Scarlett O'Hara was never intended to be the heroine in this novel, but like all dynamic characters, she took over the tale. In reality, Margaret Mitchell wrote Melanie as the heroine, and I think the fact that Melanie shines so gently throughout the tale is one of the many things about this novel that makes it exceptional.Mitchell wrote this novel because she wanted to show how different women managed to survive the American Civil War. Thus, Melanie, Scarlett, India, and Ellen. These women each coped differently to outlive the greatest war of their century in America, and the fact that Scarlett stood so high above the others is a testament to her larger-than-life validity.This novel is, and shall forever more be, my favorite piece of literature.",
            "This book has been a personal favorite of mine since I was in Elementary School. Yes, I was born a book worm with an advanced reading level. I was named for Ashley from this very book and my brother was named for Rhett so I was required to read it, but not required to like it I just happened to fall in love with Margaret Mitchell and her story. It tells so many stories in one and has such an appeal to it no wonder it is still going strong after almost 75 years. I would recommend this book to anyone, although girls seem to enjoy it more as it is told by Scarlett's point of view. Scarlett is the girl you love to hate. She is so endearing and strong but so young and naive that you want to hit her and shelter her at the same time. Rhett is a man's man and women across the world want to have him. He exudes all that is strong and masculine while being head over heels in love with Scarlett and their baby girl. Ashley is a pity case as he is torn and used. Melanie is a personal favorite of mine, like a pet kitten. She is fierce and strong with claws of steel but purrs and mews with the innocence and undying love of a newborn baby kitten. All of the characters are developed well and are all very rounded. You will get lost in this time period and forget what a cell phone is.",
            "At the insistence of a friend, I picked up Gone with the Wind to see what all the hubbub was about. I expected a shallow romance novel, much like the movie it spawned, complete with the longing stares and the yearning desires of a woman who has been spited by circumstance. I could not have been more surprised to find so much more.What I found was a novel that is surprisingly layered. The outermost layer, of course, is the romantic narrative many will recognize, but beneath this superficial casting resides a deeper narrative about the tragic hubris, resulting fall, and struggle to reemerge by a small class of Southern aristocrats. As this historical narrative unfolds, additional layers advance and recede in waves, each ushered in with insightful dialogue and commentary by the book's fascinating characters.At the base of their hubris, for example, is layered an adolescent confidence in the invincibility of King Cotton and the superiority of the antebellum order, which one character ridicules and one character fears will prove all too true. Surrounding their fall, their economic and political naivety retreats before scarcity, Sherman, and a struggle to survive, all of which is replaced by a remarkable perseverance that is more a testament to the antebellum order than anything before the war. As their struggle plays out in the treacherous climate of Reconstruction, it eventually turns into a modest triumph capped by tragedy and accompanied by ominous undertones of the segregated order to come.Other layers abound and while each is fascinating in its own right, together they are interwoven to present an even more fascinating and coherent telling of the most tumultuous period in American history. Rather than shallow, Gone with the Wind is exceptionally deep, its characters eminently profound, and its telling extremely satisfying.",
            "It's racist and sexist, and some parts drag on a little too much, yet it made my heart flutter with delight. I love it when books make you feel like this one made me. It started off slowly, but 200 pages into it I was hooked.Scarlett, she's self absorbed and as thick as a brick, but some how loveable. Rhett, why he's condescending yet somehow so wise and sexy. And sweet Melly, while she is a goody-two-shoe, she is never annoying, quiet loveable. She has an inner strength. The characters come alive on the pages.Any book that makes me cry is a good book. Oh, and did I cry! THere were parts where I was blubering for ages. In other parts, my heart was racing and I couldn't read the page fast enough.Well, this book offically rocks my socks, and is one of my favourite books, ahead of Jane Eyre and Pride and Prejudice. Why oh why didn't I read this earlier?!? 6/5 stars!",
            "Gone Wind the Wind is famous for many reasons. First, its characters are so deep and certainly born with human flaws. The plot is amazing; it is neither cliche or \"dumb\". Mitchell has done an excellent job in her historical research - it's as if you were really there in that place and era!Scarlett and Rhett are some of the best characters in all literature. Some may hate Scarlett, although I don't know why. She is unique, intelligent, beautiful, and knows what she wants. You can't blame a pretty face for knowing she is pretty. And besides, she is not so superficial or mean as one may immediately suspect - Scarlett is a three-dimensional character who learns many lessons in the end. She is certainly amusing and vain, and you have to love her for it!Although I did not like the ending at first, it now occurs to me that it was reasonable. Scarlett has made a lot of mistakes, and you can't blame Rhett for not wanting to put up with it all anymore.I know most people will enjoy this book, and it is not racist. It appears to be to the ignorant mind, but you have to understand that people spoke and behaved in such ways at this era. You cannot have black people and whites living in harmony during the Civil War, 1860's, right? This is a historical novel. And besides, doesn't anyone remember that Scarlett mentions how her black nanny is always there for her, is trustworthy and good? She does not disrespect African Americans.",
            "I read over 150 books a year, and I always have read a lot. I don't go for romance at all, but this book is so much more than that. The writing is fantastic. The vocabulary is diverse. The imagery. The characters. The plots within plots. You are there. You know the characters intimately. This is the most amazing work of fiction I have ever laid eyes on.I'm not big on re-reading things, but I've read this novel many, many times. Buy it. Read it. Treasure it.If you're \"offended by the racism,\" please try to keep in mind that political correctness will destroy your education. And whether or not this book is racist (can a _book_ be racist?) does nothing to diminsh from its genius.",
            "There were times in this book when I would be so absorbed in the story that I lost all track of time and would be surprised to discover that things had changed about in my house because everyone else was continuing on with real life.This book is so vividly portrayed. Sometimes you can almost feel the heat, hear the flies buzzing, smell the smoke from the burning buildings, hear ladies in fancy shoes schlooching through the mud.This is an epic classic. The story follows Scarlet, a hard-bitten-or-is-she Southern belle, as she goes about the process of living just before, during, and after the Civil War. It's an amazing book for any number of reasons. One, a woman writes about war and just about blows the socks off the idea that only men can do that. Two, nearly every character you meet is a well-developed person, not just some caricature. Three, details of life like cooking, nursing babies (yes, breastfeeding...), eating, dressing, flirting, dancing, everything is there. I'm surprised there isn't any toilet scene, so much is covered here. Four, tragedies of every sort occur, from Scarlet and Rhett's love story to Scarlet and Ashley's love story to Scarlet and Melanie's friendship to the loss of Bonnie. So many things happen.If you ever thought that the Civil War was a right and just war and that the South got what it deserved, consider reading this just for the opportunity to challenge your conventions and long-held beliefs.",
            "&quot;There was a Land of Cavaliers and Cotton Fields called the Old South. . .Here in this pretty world Gallantry took its last bow. . .Look for it only in books, for it is no more than a dream remembered. A Civilization Gone with the Wind.&quot;What other words could more perfectly describe the saga of Gone with the Wind?I am always astounded when I think that the 1024 pages of Gone with the Wind was Margaret Mitchell's first book! How can a green author roll so much passion, hope, strength, love, steadfastness, despair and humanity into a single novel? I blows me away, no pun intended!As reviewer kitam57 said &quot;I love Scarlett and yet at the same time I want to wring her neck.&quot; I totally concur, I admire Scarlett for her determination, her dedication to her family, her love of the land and her uniqueness. I'm more than half Irish and I too have a love for the land I live on just like Scarlett developed for Tara, as her father said &quot;It's the only thing that lasts&quot; and truly, even when Scarlett had nothing else she still had Tara and was willing to do anything, even prostitute herself to Rhett in order to keep it. She wasn't afraid to go out and break many of the social conventions of the time, like peddling lumber while pregnant, in order to take care of her family and loved ones. But at the same time, I HATE her treatment of Rhett, Scarlett had one giant blindspot by the name of Ashley Wilkes. Although, Ashley did lead her on, he never would say that he didn't love her and only loved Mellie. Scarlett clung to this hope, she pretended to hate Rhett the whole time and really deep down she knew she always liked him. I just can't understand why Scarlett thought she loved Ashley so much, he was dreamer, lost in books, music and Europe while Scarlett was practical, living for each day and facing up to harsh realities without a second thought.Rhett was always hopelessly in love with Scarlett too. It breaks my heart every time I see him try in the book and she just blows him off. When he was released from prison he ran straight to Scarlett to make sure she had enough money to keep Tara, when Scarlett tells him she's pregnant again he's so happy, and when he thinks Scarlett will die I cry too when he is nearly crazy with grief and sobbing into Mellie's skirts! There was still a chance for them later if she had just opened up and admitted that they had both been wrong! And that &quot;hungry&quot; look of Rhett's that Scarlett was always a bit scared of, it was really Rhett's starvation for love. He was watching her, waiting and hoping that she might show him some sign of love, as he said he wanted when they first danced together. Rhett's weakness was Scarlett and his need for her love, for once in his life he wanted someone to TRULY love him, not look down on him! And then tragedy enters in.Rhett of course has his scoundrel tendancies, but I admire him also for his rebellion against social conventions, he wasn't tied in by stupid traditions. he was more thinking than the rest, in that respect he and Ashley were more alike. Rhett and Ashley both knew what a war would do to the South and what a disadvantage they were at with troups and artillery. As Rhett said: &quot;I seem to be spoiling everyone's brandy, cigars and DREAMS of victory.&quot; Rhett's humanity always shows through in his admiration of Melanie, she was the one person he always treated with absolute sincerity and genuine respect.There also is the war aspect, Margaret Mitchell seems to have examined every tiny detail of the the South both during and after the war. She knows of the hardships, devastation, the starvation, the struggle, the indignities and humiliation of Reconstruction. One must always remember that just because people owned slaves, it didn't mean they were all bad people. Some were, we all know of the atrocious horrors that slaves suffered but, Margaret Mitchell shows the almost family-like relationships some people shared with their slaves. They do talk down to them and treat them as children, but slaves were not always educated at the time and therefore some didn't know how to act any differently. Mammy however is the perfect example of the smartest woman in the whole book! She always knew what was going on and loved Scarlett as her own child no matter what depths Scarlett sank to.I love the movie as well, Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable were Scarlett and Rhett brought to life, it's like they were born to play those roles! My only complaint is that they should have shown Scarlett's children with Charles and Frank in the film! However, I will always applaud the scene of Scarlett and Rhett dancing around in black amongst all the other colorful people. They are declaring their defiance and I completely admire that! In fact, I love the story of Gone with the Wind so much that I named my horse India after Ashley's sister. Next one I should name Scarlett! :)All in all, Gone with the Wind is a book for all time, no matter what your genre of book is, you will be able to appreciate it for the many dimensions of it and the ultimate truth, history, life lessons and basic human tenacity it portrays. No matter who you are, where you live or how old you are.",
            "What can I say? I am so glad to finally and proudly join the GONE WITH THE WIND readers. I have tried reading this book for years. I am SO glad I put nose to grindstone. Once I got into the story I was reading every chance I could get. And now that I am done, I am rereading snippets ... not willing to let the story go yet.What a miraculous book, a miraculous accomplishment, a masterful writer. The writing is eerily alive. Simply a brilliant brilliant work.The book is very true to the times. I have read many first hand accounts of that era, including hundreds of Slave Narratives and Margaret Mitchell told it like it was. To say this book is racist is just plain stupidity.We shouldn't read history because it's just not nice, it's just not the way we would do things, us being such enlightened souls.Waaah. Waah.How stupid. This book is about another place and time. DUH. Do a search on Black slave owners and Black confederates if you dare.As far as the human relationships in this book I rode a roller coaster.I personally loved the loyalty shown between slave and owners. &quot;they are part of our family&quot; It's true to the way it really was except the slave narratives are even more emotional and dramatic stating over and over &quot;I just want to go to heaven and see my mastus and missus again. They are the best on the whole world&quot; It's incredible. I am not talking about the selected slave narratives telling all manner of horror. I am talking about he Federal Works project that talked to actual ex-slaves and their families.As for Rhett, I had a hard time liking him. He was dashing at first but his &quot;career&quot; during the war turned me off. His fine clothes and such while people starved bothered me.... But then he proposed to Scarlet and he was so romantic and I started to really like him. I even liked him in the parlor scene when he was drunk and tortured over Scarlet's wandering heart.But by the end I didn't like him much again. I thought it was really scoundrelish of him to simply say &quot;I'm tired of it, I'm tired of you&quot; Frankly my dear I don't give a damn.Him and Scarlet had both sunk so low. I didn't like their long violent fights. It really pained me. When Scarlet was sick ... oh that broke my heart how Rhett cried into Mellie's skirt.If only... If only ...That is a very difficult part to swallow with this book ... and yet it is still a &quot;right&quot; end.I loved Ashley for his Southerness and Melanie was a beautifully wrought character. I wish Scarlet would have proclaimed her love for her more surely though. They could have lain on the bed and recounted all they had been through together.This is not just a book. It is an experience.I am SO glad that Margaret Mitchell wrote this book, a book from the South. I hope it remains in print. A people and a way of life that is Gone With The Wind will always deserve to be heard and understood.",
            "Why didn't I read this magnificent book before I was 49 years old?Perhaps because it tends to be classified in the &quot;historical romance&quot; genre ... because it was a vast popular success ... followed by a blockbuster movie ... it isn't taken seriously as a classic. It wasn't on academic reading lists, while works such as William Faulkner's &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; and Carson McCullers' &quot;The Heart is a Lonely Hunter&quot; were. But it should be.Probably GWTW couldn't have been written at any other time than it was, or by anyone else. When Margeret Mitchell was born in 1900, many living adults had been through the war and reconstruction years, and were there to tell her about it. Hers was the last generation to grow up before radio, when the oral tradition remained vital and dominant. Yet, as a child of the suffragist era and somewhat of a social rebel (engaged once, married twice, etc.), Mitchell's feisty personality is expressed through Scarlett O'Hara with rich comic effect. I frequently burst out loud laughing at Scarlett's outrageously self-serving rationalizations, and the scandalous breaches of etiquette she perpetrates. This is anything but melodrama or bodice-ripper romance. It is sophisticated social comedy, as well as historical drama and tragedy.Scarlett O'Hara, Rhett Butler, and Ashley and Melanie Wilkes endure in cultural memory to this day because Margaret Mitchell takes us into their world so convincingly that they seem real, with all their strengths, weaknesses, vanities and foibles. She has an unerring ear for dialogue. The black servants are vivid characters, pictured sympathetically as generally speaking their minds and being their authentic selves, in contrast to the ego-preserving dissembling and self-delusion of the whites.Despite the entangling of Scarlett's life with Rhett, Ashley and Melanie throughout the story, old Mammy -- the matron of the servants -- is the character who graces both the first and last pages of the book along with Scarlett. She is the only one who never betrays or leaves Scarlett; who stands with her till the end.Books about the Civil War era and its aftermath must number in the tens of thousands. But none brings it alive and lets you see it, feel it and remember it as GWTW does. It is a masterpiece, a monumental achievement.What does GWTW mean to me? At my grandmother's gravesite in East Texas, nearby tombstones cite the deceased's CSA affiliation ... 1st N.C. Cavalry, and so forth. These old soldiers migrated west after the war, just as Margaret Mitchell describes. They were my great-grandparents' generation. Margaret Mitchell brought their world alive to me as no one else ever did or could.Thank you, Margaret Mitchell, for your magnificent life's work.",
            "I can't belive i made it to 30 without reading the novel! I had seen the movie countless times and always liked it. But when I finally picked up the book and decided it was high time I read it, I was blown away. I'm captivated by Scarletts strength and courage, her honesty, and even her vanity. I couldn't put it down and now I'm ready to start all over again. If you haven't given this book a chance, do it now! You'll wish you had read it at 16.",
            "Margaret Mitchell impressed me by writing an 800 page novel about a character I sometimes wanted to strangle but about whom I couldn't read enough. Scarlett O'Hara might be self-absorbed, provincial, and manipulative, but she also displays courage, resourcefulness, and determination. Gone with the Wind is more than just a love story; it chronicles Scarlett's growth from a spoiled planter's daughter to the head of a household struggling to survive the ravages of the Civil War and Reconstruction. Mitchell provides a fascinating depiction of the psychology of the South, which plays a critical role in Scarlett's story. To thrive, she finds she must alienate the remnants of her former life and accept the presence of the Northern invaders. Throughout Scarlett wrestles with her feelings for Ashley Wilkes, a noble refugee from the genteel past, and Rhett Butler, a scalawag building his fortune from the ashes of the confederacy. Many more wonderfully drawn characters fill out this novel, which already feels somewhat compressed despite its length. It's no wonder the movie version is four hours long; the novel has too much too good to leave out!",
            "This book is just one of the best books ever. I can read it over and over again. I just love the story, the characters, the history, everything!Undoubtly the best book ever written....",
            "GWTW is simply the most beautifully tragic work of literary art of the 20th century. Margaret Mitchell not only recaptures a lost shadow world, but she also creates characters of enduring depth and passion. Upon analyzing the characters it is easy to see how Melanie and Scarlett represent the two natures of woman as Rhett and Ashley represent the two natures of man . This two fold nature of man and woman, depicts the spiritual, emotional, physical, and material struggle of each sex. This heart breaking tale is not so much reflective a lost romance, but reflective of the inner and environmental struggle and development of the self and all that it entails.As for the \"sequel\"- yes on a surface level it satisfies those who are seeking closure. But that is the problem. There is no closure and that is what the rightful author intended. It is heart breaking yes, but that in and of itself offers a deep lesson to the reader. The heartbreak emcompasses not just the lost love between Rhett and Scarlett, Scarlett and Ashley, and Scarlett and Melanie- but the heartbreak of a time lost, pride forsaken, shame never to be laid to rest, and the stark reality of future yet known.All in all this is a breathtaking tragic journey that will ravage your heart and soul. Any serious literary reader will find timeless strength in these 1000+ pages of glory had and glory lost.",
            "I purchased several years ago, and I can't remember how many times I have read it. No matter how many times you do, the story always seems fresh. My paperback copy is falling apart, so I think I am going to purchase the hardcover version. My advice is to spend a little more on the hardcover, because once you have read this novel you will be hooked.",
            "What more can I say about this book. Only that it is second to the Bible in greatness and I that could be argued. I have read it before several times and each time I get something diffetent out of it.I was skeptical about getting the audiobook because a bad narrator can ruin a good book. However, Linda Stevens does justice and then some to all the regional dialects and takes nothing away from Margaret Mitchell's masterpeice.",
            "Gone with the wind is probably one of the best books i ever read.(let me tell you first that it took me an AWFULLY LONG TIME to read GWTW because im form mexico, so english is not my language.there were times when i tought i wasnt going to be able to finish it, but i kept on going and i finally did it)GWTW is really special for me because i read it when i was going through some really hard times and it really helped me to not give up.reading about scarlett and all the things that happend to her, and the way she used the people an the things around her so she could get what she wanted was really fun and inspiring.i took for myself her always useful \"charm\" I wont think about it now, ill think about it tomorrow.\" and it has really worked for me. everyone who likes to read a good story should read GWTW. you will grow fond of the characters in no time.the only thing i didnt like about it is that sometimes it can get really confusing , there were parts in the book i had to read twice so i could follow with the story. but in general its a really good book, and i am sure you will enjoy it as much as i did.",
            "This is one of the most memorable lines of all time. And uttered by Scarlett many times throghout the book, give it a fatalistic reality. Anybody who has ever been young, in love, would fall in love with Scarlett O'Hara, the greatest heroine of all time. Her charms are many and so are her bouts of temper, her fears, her desperations, her perceptions of life. This book is simply outstanding in every aspect. Margarett Mitchelle skillfully puts Scarlett's life under the microscope and disects it ruthlessly to give you a clear picture of youth, the pride of youth which is, believe me, terrible to behold, the vanity which rules the day, the plain pigheadedness that early age has and the heartbreak that follows when youth is gone overnight and adulthood encraoches.Don't at all be scared by the lenght of the book, it is very readable. I read this book for the first time when I was 14 and still had absolutely no trouble reading it, that says a lot about its readability. For 6 days I did little else than read with urgency to disclose Scarlett's fate. The book is so splendidly written, so complete in its rendition of that age, that from cover to cover that it encloses a world that is no more and exsists only in those pages. To think that this book was actually written 73 years after the Civil War of America began in 1860, is awe-inspiring in the sense that it seems the author could have had no means about knowing that civilization, the way she does with a completeness that is all encompassing, which was destroyed in that war, had not she been a part of it, saw the sun of those times, breathed the air that blew over Atlanta (where most of the story is based) and had the notions which she shared with those people. This is writing at its pinnacle of magnificience. She staight away begins the story from the word go in a no-nonsense way. There are no lenghty introductions of any kind, no changing in time frames or point of views (we solely see Scarlett's mind in the book though the book is in the first person), no telling about events even before they happen and the retrospection , if any, comes only on the charcters parts.And a very important thing, disbelieve all that jargon about it being in the greatest love story of all time. Infact it isn't a love story at all. Of course Scarlett does fall in love and has crushes that go nowhere, but the aim of the story is not to relate a mushy love affair but what circumstances do to people, how people are changed by the deeds they perform and how thay influence each other.We watch Scarlett fall in love. We watch her love with a passion and pursue her object of desire with a ruthlessness that only extreme youth is calable of. We watch her hate, with a coolness that is chilling to observe, hatred that only can be generated by hurt pride and stained vanity.Scarlett is young and beautiful and rich and brimming with life and health, no sorrow can touch her, and she sets out to conquer the world. Why should she not have everything she wants, every petty fancy fulfilled, every man falling in love with her? We know that the world dosent let such people be, these people invite almost too much jealosy, the world is very cruel to such people. So when the world does slap her across her face, she declares war aginst the world with her head held high. And still she is not a larger than life character, its as you or I would have reacted in such a situation, when you lived in a society in which she lived, if the world in which you lived was falling apart and war arrived at your doorstep. It potrays every kind of emotion a human ever went through and in all its splendor and glory.This story is also about tumultous times. It is the story of the Old South where innocent people lived the life of kings which is only present in memory. They are invincible in their paradise of cotton plantations and tea parties, but when war cuts through their lives like a knife, you can't but feel sorry for these people whose world ceases to exsist, and they live the rest of their lives serching like children for a meaning in their life they know isn't there, for an identity that has been erased, for salvation that will never come. Their inevitable tragedy breaks your heart and set at the heart of this interwining ouilt work of humanity lies the story of Scarlett. We see how she influences people around her and is changed herself in return by what she encounters.All in all the book is a treasure, one of the greatest contributions of America to the world of fiction and a must read for all generations. I recommend this book with all my heart. Read it and you'll thank the memory of Margarett Mitchelle for creating this piece of art.",
            "The book I am doing a review on is Gone With the Wind. This book is by the author Margaret Mitchell. This story is about an independent teenage girl named Scarlett O'Hara who lives in Georgia before the Civil War. She is in love with a boy named Ashley, and plans to be with him but he is arranged to be married with another girl, so Scarlett makes a big plan to make him hers, but before she can do it the Civil War breaks out and complicates everything for her. The front and back cover made me want to read it. If you are a person who loves adventure, suspense, and romance, then you should definitely read this book. This book is targeted for people between the ages of 15 and 70.The good thing about this book is that it has a plot that seems at some points seem irrelevant but are actually very important to the outcome of the resolution. If the book had even more conflicts then it would be even better because the conflicts make the story nail biting like this excerpt from the book. \"Somebody hollerin',\" said Porky uneasily. \"The Yankees are coming! I saw them! Down the road! The Yankees ---,\" Another thing I like about the book is that it has Scarlett, the main character, is a perfect mix of flare and emotions like this excerpt from the book. \"I don't want your advice,\" yelled Scarlett. I think this book has anything that I didn't like but if there were it would probably be the way there are many characters, but it sort of makes the story better, but for me it gets me confused sometimes like in this excerpt of the book. \"Well push Randa off you, Betsy, and hush. Now listen to me Gerald O'Hara.\" My overall opinion off the book is that I liked it very much. I think I like it so much because it contains a plot and setting that takes place in many different locations, it's not just stationary. So again, I think you should read this book because it contains vivid vocabulary, has triumphs and downfalls that make the story better, and has takes advantage of the readers' sense of adventure, and after watch the movie.",
            "A simply superb novel; it has become my favorite book. People of all ages can appreciate this masterpiece; I'm 16 and I couldn't put it down (not for food, sleep, or a six and a half hour flight), my 13 year old sister loved it, my little brother cried at the end, and an elderly woman and her husband, I met on the afore mentioned flight, said to me it was one of the best books of all time. &lt;space>Even though I had seen the movie -which I also love- so I knew what was going to happen, I wept uncontrollably. This is a must have and worth the 1024 or so pages. At the conclusion of this novel, the fact that it isn't any longer is the only disapointment. Reading it is a supreme pleasure.",
            "I agree with the hundreds...wait, millions of people over the years who've enjoyed this classic. Despite her charater not being too sympathetic, Scarlett is a real survivor and that's why we still care for her. If you haven't read the book because you already enjoyed the movie, you are really missing a lot.",
            "Oh, how I suffer for my enjoyment of this book! When I told a prospective lover that this was my fave tome, he recoiled in white liberal revulsion, demanding if I'd read `Roots'. The truth is that I have never read GWTW for the racism, and condemning it almost seems superfluous. I take it as read that this is a work of its time, written in the 1930s which harked back to the days of slavery and the ante-bellum South. A `Wuthering Heights' of the Confederacy, with its two passionate leads and wishy-washy support acts. Margaret Mitchell spend ten years writing GWTW, and it's perhaps thanks to her husband John Marsh, who persuaded her to write rather than read. After all she was an Atlanta journo in the 1920s and not short of a story or two... just what to do with them. The result is a 1000 page plus commotion which spans the years and charts the travels of various types, as they wind their way from having it all to down on their uppers to getting back up again. None more so than Scarlett O'Hara, who, fed up with playing the feminine card (which she nonetheless does to the hilt), benefits from the destruction of Southern life inasmuch as she answers her true calling - to be a better businessman than the boys. For which she pays the price of emotional loss, albeit of her own daft making.MM wrote at a time when many were denied the enfranchisement that we all deserve. And like many other works of the past, she falls foul of the politically correct watershed. But ignore the broadsheet bores if you dare, and see this novel for when it was conceived. And then relish the familiar themes of survival and in love with love and you might just enjoy it.",
            "The power of this narrative of the American Civil War and the Reconstruction period after the war is overwhelming. Scarlett O'Hara is the centerpiece of this story from the beginning to the end. It is much more than a story of love, rivalry, and misadventure. It is all that and more. It offers the reader a portrait of the Confederacy and the candid view of life there as filtered through the eyes of Scarlett. It is Melanie Hamilton and Ashley Wilkes who represent the values of the old South and the ambition of Scarlett and the cynicsm of Rhett Butler reflect the newly emerging South of the Reconstruction.",
            "Perhaps it was Scarlett's unbreakable spirit as she tries to overcome her physical and mental struggles. Maybe it is the unreadabe and constantly fickle Rhett Butler. Or possibly it is the way the author describes the characters, the settings, and the events of this gripping novel in her own unique way. I really cannot specifically pinpoint why &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is my favorite book. All I know is that somehow it captivated me, and even now, a year after I first read it, I am still constantly thinking about it. The hard simplicity and honesty of the novel make it easy to love, and I imagine I will always cherish it.",
            "a long time ago, i had heard about gone with the wind, a lot of my friends parents would tell me about it, and i never, ever, thought that i would actually enjoy reading this 1000 paged book. i was very much mistaken. margaret mitchell really could write a story. at work one day, there was an old copy on our shelf, i decided to pick it up and just for the heck of it, give it a chance. well, lets just say, i could not put it down. it was by far the most captivating, best story ever written. after you are done reading it, it remains in your heart forever. scarlett is our present day ally mcbeal, looking for love in all the wrong places, confused, not having a clue what she really wants out of a relationship. rhett, he is the most sexiest character ever written, no present day harlequin romance even comes close. but if you want to know more, you must read the book, believe me you will not be disappointed.",
            "I noticed some other people who wrote reviews complaining about how racist the book is. I hope it will help show how it happened that there was a terribly bloody war fought and that slaveholders were less monstrous than I used to think. I loved the book. The sequel was less good, but everyone should still read it",
            "There are many reviews for the edition of this classic novel stating that page 713 is missing and in it's place is 813.I ordered this edition because I loved the cover. That may sound materialistic, but I really didn't care that one page was wronged, as I am used to reading books that have pages missing (Our library is in need lol)I recieved my copy yesterday, and immediately turned to see this notorius mistake. I am happy to report that the problem has been fixed, and that page 713 is now there!THis is a wonderful edition. The cover is beautiful, the pages neatly layed out, and a quite enjoyable book at that.Wonderful wonderful wonderful. Strongly recommend it!!",
            "I was feverently reading a key scene between Rhett and Scarlett last night and when I got to page 713 - there WAS not 713. It was page 813!! Uggh! What a bummer. Great story, one of the best I've ever read, but that missing page really breaks up the flow. Buy a different version!",
            "GWTW is a classic, undoubtedly - sweeping, romantic, colorful, well written, all of that. I have read it so many times and seen the movie enough to recite it word for word, loved swashbuckling Captain Butler and plucky, selfish Scarlett for all that she is, a woman of her own worth during times when women were showpieces more than anything else. And i absolutely love the descriptions of the civil war background - it is sweeping, historically accurate and touching, many times. I can slip the movie in at any scene or pick up the book and spend a few hours undisturbed just lost in its language and flow.All of that said, i think it is important not to forget that Mitchell has not mentioned one word against slavery in the 800+ pages she penned, slavery being the burning, heart rending issue of the time the novel was set. Every country and state goes through change, for good or bad and we lose times that were precious, sentimental, valuable - or we lose a 'land of grace and plenty' as she calls pre war Georgia. But we also gain causes that are worth it in terms of human reslience and courage and value/respect for others. Looking at it that way the novel comes across like a victorian painting - pretty and appealing but lacking in soul.",
            "People read the book and leave all the politics aside if you're going to read this book. Enjoy it and remember this book was written in the 1930's. Very different way of thinking back then. I have read some of the reviews and I just threw my hands in the air and decided to write my review. That is how mad I got. Why? Well, everytime someone decides to write a review about a book that took place during the civil war someone has to put in there two cents, about how horrible the whites treated the slaves or how horrible slavery was. Please. Okay, yes slavery did happen. And I don't conden it niether. But everyday one can not escape not listening to it about the subject on t.v.(especially the Oprah show, I really think that lady spends her life talking about the subject, bitter woman, or movies, or songs, ect. ect. ect. From all I have read and seen and learned does one really believe all the plantation owners beat there slaves and killed them? I mean would a plantation owner who paid top dollar for a slave just take him home and starve him, beat him, and have chained him and just treat him worse than a dog. I don't think so. It just not possible that all plantation owners did that. If that really was widespread as we are lead to believe then now, then there would have been an uprising of slaves sooner then Civil War. There would not have been any need for a Civil War if all the whites of the South then were the cruel vicious monster we have been lead to believe they were. As allways when we have a small majorit of people to tell us history (that is t.v., roots, and all them bad history channels, and magazines and supposely non-fiction books that are written with the liberal mentality), they just re-write history. If one really wants to find out the history of the south. READ OLD BOOKS ON HISTORY!!! NOT THE NEW ONES!!! OLD BOOKS!!! WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT HISTORY IT HAS ALL BEEN RE-WRITTEN!!! Whew! I feel better now.Oh by the way. This is from a Hispanic telling you this.So if you really want to enjoy this book. Enjoy reading Scarlett scandals and her fight to never be hungry again. Enjoy her trying ever art she knows to take that poor excuse of a man Ashley away from the every loyal Melanie. Enjoy Scarlett when she tries to figure out Rhett and why she just cannot get it through her thick bull-headed head that she always has been in love him.",
            "Like it or not-- and there are PLENTY of reasons not to like GWTW-- this book earns its status as a classic. It reminded me of Anna Karenina: well-written, brilliant &amp; deliciously soapy plot, and ultimately depressing. In the end, I was fed up with Rhett &amp; Scarlett, but I still cried for them.As a northerner living in the south, I got a new appreciation for/insight into the rich history of white southerners, but good luck finding any insight into the world of black southerners. True, Mitchell was a product of her times and one needs to allow for that, but she says some HORRIBLY insensitive things about black people.If you read this book, keep it in context. Remember that it is only one part of history, only one book, somewhere in the middle of truth and lies and legend.P.S.-- Zora Neale Hurston's &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot; would be an interesting book to read afterwards, especially if you need to restore your faith in true love.",
            "Haven't finished yet (300 pages left) but I'm loving this book... nothing horribly suspenseful happens yet I can't put it down. It's also easy to read- I never find myself thinking, &#34;Okay, let's get on with it&#34; as most people expect to do from books of this time period. It's very long (1037 pages) but don't let that deter you!",
            "This could/should be the book required in high school on the American Civil War and Reconstruction. It's also a romantic novel from a female's perspective, which is an interesting twist on a genre that traditionally has male heroes.",
            "First, let me say that Gone With the Wind is possibly the best and most satisfyingly well-written novel I have ever read. To quote Alice Randall, the author of another favorite of mine, The Wind Done Gone, &quot;Above all, Gone With the Wind made me think.&quot;Anyone who gives this book less than three stars invariably does so because of the rampant racism throughout the novel. One cannot say in defense that it was simply the views of the people at the time, because Magaret Mitchell, the author, was not just being historically accurate; she was racist herself.The horror! A racist novel by a racist author! And what's worse, it's one of the best loved novels in America.Parts of this book did make me cringe and leave me angry, namely the roles of Prissy and Big Sam. Yes, those parts were atrocious. But here's a thought:Pretend for a minute that you were born in the early 1900's, in the deep South, with Confederate veterans and aging Southern belles for family. Now tell me you wouldn't be racist. Of course, any middle class enlightened white person would say they'd know better, but would you? I greatly doubt it. Gone With the Wind is fiction, not fact, from the mind of a woman who embodied what her family taught her, no more. Take it and move on. Sure, it's offensive, but it's also wonderful. There are too many layers to this novel for the complexity of it to be fully appreciated in my review, but if you're can't get past the racism to appreciate this book, then I have to wonder what else you're missing in life.What I did when I finished Gone With the Wind was go out and buy Alice Randall's book The Wind Done Gone. It's very thought provoking, and it will mollify a bit of your anger dealing with the bad treatment of blacks in this book. Also, I reccomend The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison, because it deals with the internalized racism that slaves felt in the pre-war South. Beloved is another great one that will show you what the slaves REALLY went through. But don't miss out on Gone With the Wind. Read it, love it, and let it show you the past.",
            "I haven't really heard anything about this book nor have I seen the movie, so I didn't know what to expect when I started reading. I suppose I could use my desire to to broaden my reading scope as a reason for picking up this novel. I haven't read enough of the classics, the heavy stuff, the stuff that should have a good reason for staying around this long.Anyway, this book was teeming with racist undertones, and it annoyed me, to say the least. I could never really get comfortable with the writing, however beautiful and applause-worthy it was, because in would come the worthless diatribes about the slaves and how dumb and shiftless and worthless they were. It's not that the book was written about times of slavery and the aftermath of the American Civil War; I understand that people in those times had their reasons and their own beliefs. (I read Queen by Alex Haley with no problem, although I will concede that Queen was written by descendant of slaves and the view would be slightly different.) But I wonder if the woman who wrote Gone With the Wind was racist--or at the very least more than mildly prejudiced--because she wrote unnecessary addendums when describing the 'darkies,' superfluous ramblings that seemed to be more her own thoughts than the thoughts of the book's characters. She wrote things like, [the slave girl] couldn't comprehend...in her little black skull, and the use of the 'n' word when something else would have sufficed. The way she described Big Sam's excitement in seeing his mistress again after the war almost made my blood run cold. I ran into a lot about how the 'good' slaves all hated the idea of being free and the 'no good free issue' slaves were the ones who, apparently, realized that they were getting a raw deal when it came to that 'peculiar institution.' Really, wanting to be equal to whites [in every way that counted] was such a preposterous idea! I get the feeling I'm overreacting, but that's what happens when you read material like that in times such as these.Another thing that bothered me about it is that this is supposed to be the greatest love story of all time and almost eight hundred pages into the thing, Rhett and Scarlett still weren't together. He loved her--he admitted this to her at least thrice--and she didn't realize that she even really liked him, let alone loved him, until she halfway got over her Ashley Wilkes obsession.My third problem with the book came in the form of one young Miss O'Hara. As much as I tried to remain sympathetic and understanding to Scarlett's plight and her reasonings, her behavior made it easy for me to remain unmoved while reading. While I applauded her moments of unselfishness (very few and far between), Katie Scarlett O'Hara Hamilton Kennedy Butler was a nuisance and she was one of the main reasons I walked away from this book without too much feeling. However, I did love the way Rhett was written, for reasons I cannot properly articulate because even I do not know why I liked him so much. I guess I believe he and Melanie Hamilton Wilkes were the only truly likeable people in this book.The language was beautiful, the scenes vivid, breathtaking and all of that which is desirable when talking books. Ms. Mitchell wrote a really good book but sadly, it's not for everyone to enjoy.",
            "A real classic that I read first in 1963, and have read many times since. Just buying a copy for Kindle.",
            "Margaret Mitchell's Scarlett was a strong woman who could just as easily lived in the 1960s as she did the 1860s. What a strong, admirable role model she must have been for girls when this book first came out in the thirties. All those pages and yet, I couldn't put the thing down.",
            "Mitchell combined love and war the way no other writer could have done it. The romance between Scarlett and Rhett left readers clinging to every word spoken between the two. In the midst of their world falling apart, Phett still had a passion for Scarlett, and Scarlett for Ashley. However, she never tells whether or not Scarlett ever gets Rhett in the end.",
            "Gone With the Wind is, obviously, my favorite book ever, but I truly believe it is one of the best ever written. I read this book when I was 12 years old, and I finished it in four days. I was so entirely engrossed in the setting, characters, and plot that I could honestly, literally just NOT put it down.Although the issue of which I am about to address did not bother or offend me in the least, however I am not racist or pro-slavery, I will talk about this in hope of enlightening a few more people and maybe helping to share the magic of GWTW. Sure, there are some things relating to racism, and of course to slavery, but I don't see why people are so offended by this. Yes, racism is wrong, and the way some slave owners treated their slaves, and how whites treated blacks, was absolutely horrifying, but, this is only a book. Slavery has long since been abolished and racism is now, thankfully, dwindling to almost nothing.At first, I'll admit, I was not fond of Scarlett, but after a while, I became used to her ways, and I really became absorbed into the book and felt as though I was walking in her shoes, and I understand why she did some things she did. The character development in this book is amazing; so is the extensive description.Gone With the Wind is such an amazing book for many reasons, but for me it has to be the ability which Mitchell has to take her readers into the story as though they were living the events themselves. I also loved the desperation and want Scarlett felt for Rhett as she realized she truly loved him, and of course, their stubborn relationship before they were married.There is not much more I can say that hasn't been said, except this: for hopeless romantics and avid readers (of which I am both), you will surely love GWTW. For everyone else: keep an open mind while you read. Remember that times have changed drastically and try to imagine if you were Scarlett yourself. Also, dive in the culture in which this book was written. Even if you don't agree with it, I believe everyone deserves an enjoyable read from of Gone With the Wind.",
            "Imagine that in a flurry, your old life disappears; what was once poverty and happiness has transformed into poverty and a new, bittersweet lifestyle. Welcome to Scarlett O'Hara's corrupted world, where what once seemed improper is now necessary to survive. I thought this book brilliantly combined romance, adventure, and non-fiction information based on the southern aspect of the Civil War.",
            "I READ THIS BOOK AT ABOUT THE AGE OF 14. IT WAS THE FIRST BOOK ,EVEN AT THE LENGTH IT IS, THAT I DIDN'T WANT TO END! I SO MUCH WANTED THE CHARACTERS TO CONTINUE! WHEN I FINALLY SAW THE MOVIE YEARS LATER-IT WAS MORE THAN I COULD HAVE ASKED FOR. IT WAS ABOUT THAT TIME THAT I FELL IN LOVE WITH CLARK GABLE! I FEEL THAT THIS BOOK WAS THE ORIGINAL HISTORICAL ROMANCE NOVEL, AND THAT EVERYTHING ELSE PALES IN COMPARISON!",
            "I must have read this book umpteen number of times and i find the characters of Scarlet and Rhett ever evolving .If u are a die hard romantic who believes in fighting for your dreams then this book is a must ...",
            "This book is quite fair, not exactly the best, but good enough. I thought it should be a very challenging book but I was disappointed...I read it last year (13 yr old) and was astonished on how easy the vocabulary is and how easy it is to read this book.As for the story...it's pretty good. I really like those historical novels, and the writing and descrbtion is wonderful... but some parts of the story is a drag.",
            "I read this book once. Once was enough, but twice would be better. I'm an avid reader, and writer. This book captured every emotion that literary devices are suppose to capture. I found myself crying, laughing, scared, shocked. I've been searching for a book that competes with Gone With the Wind and haven't found one. You know the main characters like they are in your life, and you're taken back to the Civil War. Nothing is downcasted, everything is how it was in the eighteen sixies. Scarlett O'Hara was such a wonderful character, she lives in everyone hearts long after the last page is turned. Even though the book is lengthy, it keeps your attention, truely, until the last page and would keep it further if it were longer. The book was amazing, a true American Literature Classic. I highly recommend this book. You won't be able to find another like it. Gone With the Wind is a true, diamon in the rough.",
            "and hope she loves as much as I do.I have read this story several times- so many that I have it commited to memory!I always had a copy of it with me until my last one feel apart from reading it to many times.!Scarlett is a strong woman, and in that time that strength was frowned upon by both men and women. I have - many times, drawn on the strength that she had through out the story.I hope that my daughter reads this when she is a teen and sees Scarlett for the modern woman that she is.",
            "Gone With the Wind is a beatifully written book that intrigued me from the very beginning! I had to read this book for an English class. My mom suggested it to me and I decided to make her happy I would start it, but I knew I'd never finish it- I mean 1,000 pages???? But, the first time I picked it up I read until page 70 and I would have kept reading, but it was late! It made me laugh, cry, and everything in between. I love how the book ends how it ends.(I can't tell you how!)I did read the sequel, and I have to say, it was OK, but not nearly as well written as Gone With the Wind. I would recommend this book to anyone who is in need of a good novel. Don't let the 1,000 pages intimidate you because when you read it, you'll forget there are that many pages, honest!!!!!",
            "Margaret Mitchell captures the essence of the Old South and skillfully interweaves that history with the travail of the civil war. She illustrates the high purposes for which the South fought the war and also demonstrates the utter futility of the Southern position and the senseless nature of most conflicts.",
            "IT IS ONE OF THE MOST UNFORGETTABLE STORY I HAVE EVER READ . IT IS ONE STORY THAT IS HARD TO RESIST AND STOP READING . WHO CAN EVER EVER FORGET THE FIERY CHARACTER OF SCARLETT O'HARA AND THE COOL , DASHING SOLDIER OF FORTUNE , RHETT BUTLER AND THEIR UNUSUAL DEVELOPMENT OF LOVE ?",
            "Before I picked up this book, I read most of the reviews, but I knew better than to let the opinions of others influence me tremendously. And so, I read through 1000 pages of war, Southern society/conventions in the antebellum and reconstruction South, and of course, the tempestuous romance between Scarlett and Rhett.I was expecting a romance, but I cannot classify GWTW as romance, but rather as historical fiction. Margaret Mitchell writes with a voice that captivates, evokes emotion, but most of all, she brings the Civil War and its aftermath to life especially through Scarlett O'Hara. The destitution, plights, burdens, and silly notions/convictions of Scarlett's reflect the people of the time; it gives readers a glimpse of failure, poverty, and the desperation war leaves in its trail. This is why I enjoyed this novel-the sentiments, struggles, and even the uncharitable thoughts going through Scarlett's head allowed me to feel empathy and to relate. The ignorance, grief, desperation, painful repercussions, and hope that circulate throughout novel are artfully portrayed.As to the romance, it wasn't what I was hoping for, but it was realistic. Honestly, I didn't like a single character in the novel because none of them knew the true meaning of love, and if they did, they didn't know how to express it. Scarlett is comparable to a spoiled, pampered child who lives eternally in her bubble even after all her hardships; she sees but does not grasp and doesn't have the will to do so. However, her strength and courage are to be commmended because despite her beliefs, she does not fail herself or others when it truly matters. Rhett is a complete idiot and their disastrous marriage is partly his fault because he never fought for his love...just like his blase skeptical outlook on people and life, he let it all slide by because what he hoped for didn't turn out to be reality. He used the wrong approach and so the ends did not meet as it should have, and how he hurt in the process. Mellanie was just too nice and naive to really be human; I find it almost unbelievable at times to see how much faith she had in everyone. Just as Scarlett's selfish, ill-conceived thoughts never ceased to amaze me, Mellanie's belief in man's better nature was as tedious. She is however the most likeable character. Ashley is weak, pitiful and as Scarlett realizes, the type of man girls dream about, but not worthy of their idolatry because the disillusionment is not worth it. Despite having a hard time liking any of the selfish or selfless and infinitely unworthy characters, I must admit that the characterization was dynamic. I really wanted to slap Scarlett, Mellanie, Rhett, and Ashley at some point or other. And at the same time, my heart went out to them because I could understand why they did the things they did.GWTW is an entertaining read, unique to its kind (just like The Fountainhead), but I didn't find it magnificent or glorious. The novel is as bitter as it is uplifting and I couldn't find a balance between the two. Just a lot of tolerance for silly, selfish, careless creatures and pity for those who reach the \"aha\" moment when it is too late. Because it's so well-written though, I know for sure that it is not a novel I am going to forget (which is often the case) and I am very glad I forced myself to read it. It was definitely an experience.",
            "This book was published in 1936; in the ensuing seventy years, no one has even come close to topping it. Enough said.",
            "This book is definitely worth the read. Although long, Gone with the Wind by Margaret Mitchell has a lot going on in it. Mitchell develops the characters so well that you can almost see them. It is also great for history. This is because I always learned about the civil war through the northerners eyes. In this book you see it all through the eyes of a southerner. As the story progresses you build up more and more grudges against Scarlet, who is not your best friend. Scarlet is rude and takes on too \"manly\" duties. Close to the end, though, she finally gets kicked back. When hard times hit she becomes more sweet, gentle and womanly. However, that does not last long enough. When her marital status changes she regains money and again, she gives up her sweetness and goes back to her old self. This book would be good for those who enjoy romantic, historical and classic novels about the civil war. Stick with it through the slow parts and you can easily enjoy the rest. If you have not read this yet, buy in now, it will not be like any other book you've ever read.",
            "I first read this book while in high school and I still love it 30 years later. It is also a great book for history of the civil war. It is an way for people not southerners to find out how the war was for the south.",
            "Selfish, sought after, sixteen-year-old Katie \"Scarlett\" O'Hara has everything a Southern Belle could want as the story begins in April of 1861: a loving family; a plethora of attentive suitors, and a lovely home on a plantation situated 25 miles from Atlanta, Georgia, maintained by the family's (p 279) hundred slaves. She soon learns that the primary object of her affections, Ashley Wilkes, is to about to announce his engagement. And before you know it, she has professed her love to one man, encountered another (Rhett Butler) for the first time, become engaged, married, pregnant and widowed. Meanwhile, most of the local males have become Confederate soldiers, battling on the side of the South in the Civil War. As the locals mourn their dead and the battles rage on, Scarlett chooses to return to Tara. After surviving a harrowing journey, she learns the fate of her family and home, and takes on roles of caregiver, operations manager, and manual laborer for the plantation along with its remaining inhabitants. She marries, again with ulterior motives, and moves to Atlanta, where her behavior as sole businesswoman starts tongues wagging. One wonders, will she ever find love?When the story ends, twelve years later, the war is over and many of her loved ones have passed. While she learns a few things about friendship, family, love, and loss, some things never change, like her feelings (contempt and disdain) about slaves and beliefs about slavery (better for them than their freedom). With its racist rhetoric, negative stereotypes, and inflammatory words for blacks (the \"n\" word alone appears ninety times), it is a lesson on the incomprehensible capacity of humans to justify their infliction of suffering on others and will likely cause many readers to squirm. But it is also a masterful epic on life and love in the South during the Civil War, with great character development and spectacular writing (including some neat old, odd words) which make it a worthy read from start to 700-plus page finish.",
            "I purchased this book for a gift. The cover and the text were good, but the side of the book had a huge black marker line right down the bottom. I don't mind so much for myself, but I do not feel good about giving a gift that is marred. I was very unhappy.",

She was so nice, loyal, trustworthy, loving, brave, courageous, funny, charming, polite, and Oh! so much more...My least favorite character was Rhett. \"That nasty varmint!\" as Scarlett said. I hated how Scarlett was so mean to Melanie, until it was too late. But no matter what scarlett did or said that was wrong, Melanie still loved her and stuck by her until the end, and even past then!

It makes me so frusterated. I never thought a book could do that. As soon as I found out there was a sequel, I went to the library and read it. It may not be as good as Gone With the Wind (but then, what is?) but it gives a plausible answer to this phenomenal saga of the south.",
            "After seeing the movie, I just had to read the novel. Although parts vary from what they are in the movie, it doesn't at all take away from the magic in Margaret Mitchell's words. I see Scarlett as someone I would want to be be. A woman who's strong, beautiful, and vain... and gets away with it. Rhett Butler is the epitimy of what a man should be. He's romantic and keeps you wondering what he's going to do next. All of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler's trials and happy moments are what makes Gone With the Wind the classic that it is. Mitchell's way of describing the brave (but horrible) downfall of the South is extrodinary. Anyone who loves romance, wit, and adventure should definitely read Gone With the Wind!",

I wish Scarlett would have waited for Rhett when he was in jail though. I wish Scarlett would have just admitted to Rhett that she loved him sooner. I think Ashley was kind of a wimp, and I did not understand why Scarlett had wanted Ashley when she had a man like Rhett who wanted her. I was glad when she tried to get him back at the end and I can't wait to get the sequel.",

It's almost like be there, back in the 1800's, during the civil war. You feel the characters, there joy, there pain. The movie wasn't that great! I look forward to reading the sequal. I highly recomend this book, you won't be sorry after reading it.",

The friends/foes/lovers relationship between Rhett and Scarlett is unforgettable. I found this to be a truly inspirational book, how to treat people properly and how to be a true friend and lover. This book is amazing , I couldn't put it down and I finished it in only 3 days. I am also starting to read the sequel &quot;Scarlett&quot; by Alexandra Riply. I give this book 5 stars! *****Jenn",
            "I have reread this book four times in the last year, and everytime I read it, I catch more than the previous time. The love story told compares to that of Romeo and Juliet. The sequencing of events could not be better; it grips you until the last page, and leaves you wondering how Scarlett deals with her personal losses. The intermixing of historical fact and fictional characters is phenomenal. Never again will a novel soar as high as this; it is as popular as the Bible.",
            "I think that it is the best story I have ever read!! It was magnificent detail, and includes everything, from history to love to war and action. Amazing the way Mitchell makes you think about everything. I would reccomend anybody who likes good reading, to read it.",

You can't help but admire Scarlett and all she stands for. At times all she had was her determination to survive and her pride. Once in school we had to do a report on the person we most admire. I had to convince the teacher to let me do it on Scarlett. Whenever I come to a hard time in my life, I try to be strong and I compare strong to Scarlett. This book tells not only how the South was affected but how the lives of the woman left behind were affected by the Civil War. The book is so vivid that you feel that you are with Scarlett, Rhett, and all the other unforgettable characters. I hope that I meet a man like Rhett. He loved Scarlett for years, knowing the worst of her but still loving her despite her faults. The book is the epitome of the Old South; with all the grace, beauty, and pride to go along with it.",
            "I loved this book! I love to read about the Civil War and this book takes you from the beginning to the end of this great time period. I'm 14 years old and a lot of my 8th grade classmates thought I was nuts to read it. But I didn't let that get in my way. I've seen the movie and don't think it got even close to the book. If you want to read a great romance/adventure/tradgedy this is the book for you!",
            "I read Gone With the Wind in the seventh grade, and since then have read it several times. To me it is an inspiration; its plot is magnificent, its characters well developed and true. It is a book that truly embodies the dream of writing the &quot;Great American Novel&quot;",
            "What can you say about this novel? The prose evokes comparison to Edith Wharton's. The characters live and breathe before you on the page. The setting is set in intimate detail, and it swirls in your mind's eye as you drink in the words. Amazing novel. Scarlett seems much stronger in literature than her flighty character in the film. Once I could escape my preconceived notion of the characters taken from the film, the book became pure joy to read.",
            "Gone With The Wind is a great book,about a young girl, Scarlett, who is a terrible flirt. I read it this summer and I'm only nine, the context wasn't too challenging. M.M. wove the story plot extremely well,it kept me in suspense until the very end, and I want to read the sequal. All in all , if I could, I would give this book infinity stars.",
            "Gone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell is a classic historical fiction novel with vivid descriptions of the Old South and the Civil War. It is from the Confederate's point of view, and the protagonist is Scarlett O'Hara, a headstron, stubborn, and spoiled Southern Belle with deep strength and passion. If Scarlett needs something bad enough, she will not hesitate to throw away proper social conduct or her own personal goals. This strength comes not from within her, but from using the misfortunes of others to her advantage. She is like a child in the sense that she orders people around and always gets her way. The problem in the long run is that this strenth all too often blinds her to the good things and the love that reaches out to her, but she pushes them away, so set in her own ways that she wont even consider other possibilities. Tara is Scarlett's one true love, and she would do anything for it. Scarlett survives the hardships of war as her would falls down around her with only her wit and determination left. She cannot ignore life, nor can she put on a polite mask and act as though there had never been a war. She uses the struggle to rebuild Atlanta to make her start in business. Although Scarlett is a strong and independent woman, most people can relate to her because she makes mistakes like a normal human. This book examines different types of strength. Whether it is Mammy's honorable courage and dignity, or Rhett's keen level-headedness, or Melanie's Christian devotion to people, each person has his or her own root from which they draw their strength. The writing is superb, and the plot is dramatic and sad, but it includes enough of Scarlett's triumphs of strength that sets it apart from all other books. This is a must-read for any person who loves classic literature.",
            "This book touched the hearts of millions, and truly makes us realize the appreciation of life. I found myself so much like Scarlett, that I began to chenge my ways, and learned to be a self-less person. You know how the book always better than the movie? Well, for those of you who saw the film, (probably the best film ever made; it was rated higher than Titanic!), you can imagine how good this book must be!!! Trust me-TAKE MY ADVICE! I AM A FULL TIME READER!!! THIS BOOK IS THE CREAM OF THE CROP!!!!!!!",
            "I had to add my accolades to those who declare GWTW the great American novel, and weigh the vote beyond the 4+ it currently has. Who are these people giving a novel so rich in in scope, so remakable in the development, so intense you can smell the magnolias, a one? It is the only book I have ever read more than twice. Double or tripple readings are only for those very, very special books, right? If it were not for the movie and the hype, the book would have more respect. GWTW forever!",
            "This is a great novel. Do not let its success fool you into thinking it isn't that good. I won't repeat the many positive reviews here. Just let me add one note: the book has an extraordinary amount of cynicism in it which is startling at first but makes perfect sense as this novel is about the destruction of all that is good by men-on a large scale, the south's destruction, on a smaller scale, the destruction of Rhett's love by the vices and selfishness of Scarlett.",
            "I have read Gone With the Wind 16 times(I'm eleven yrs. old)and it still ties for my favorite book(with The Mists of Avalon) I know all anyone would ever want to know about the movie(and a lot more besides)and plenty about the book. The ending is perfect and appropriate for the story, the characters are interesting, tightly intertwined into the story, and so real it feels like I am standing there in a hoop skirt and corset whenever I read the book(my waist constricts and everything)",
            "The book is as good as it can get. I read it while in high school, then again a few years later while in college. I'd like to read its sequel. The climax however was not quite as hunky dory as I would have liked it. It was one of my first books other than the normal run-of-the-mill stuff like adventure stories so its left quite a positive impact on me.",
            "I loved this book. I read it twice in the past year. The story is beautifully written. Margaret Mitchell is a genious. The quote &quot;After all tomorrow is another day,&quot; is the quote we all will repeat to ourselves to make life seem easier. Life goes on.",
            "I first read GWTW when I was 16 years old, and I've been spellbound ever since. This is a book that truly made me feel as if I'd known the characters for years; I cried with every defeat and celebrated every defeat with Scarlett. Once you pick it up, you can't put it down until it's finished. I felt that it was similar to &quot;North and South&quot; in content, but that the emphasis on the characters was more personal. Also, it has a little of everything--history (without being dull), romance (without being overdone), and personal triumph.",
            "I don't know if there is anything that Margaret Mitchell failed to put into this book. It is obvious that the author poured her entire being into this book and it is evident as you read that this story must have been very close to her heart as it always grabs hold of the hearts of countless readers. The book is written by an obvious historian and gives many details of the way of life of the people of the old south and the Civil War days as well. There is romance, a glimpse into the past, heartbreak, hope, triumph, struggle, life lessons, love, and the story of Scarlett O'Hara that will continue to live in the hearts of readers for generations to come. No matter what kind of books you like to read you will enjoy Gone with the Wind and take a piece of the book away with you for it never fails to leave one thinking about what the important things in life are.",
            "What a thumping good read! Unright-on and politically incorrect it may be, but frankly my dear... This book contains all things horrid - racism, slavery, going for your best friend's man (and your sister's!), cruelty to animals and unfortunates, deforestation, to name but a few. But so what? The characters are so strong they could be placed in any walk of life and flourish. OK, maybe not that insipid piscean-like Ashley Wilkes, but he should've been drowned at birth anyhow! How Scarlett could've been gagging for him for any longer than a couple of weeks is a mystery to me, but I guess he was a challenge (no wonder Rhett felt inadequate!). To be fair, the book does goes on a bit in parts, and I feel Margaret Mitchell could've employed her journalistic skills and been a little more succinct. There are a number of characters that I see no need for and having seen the film so many times, I believe she could have honed her dialogue more. But Mags is so much kinder to Scarlett than Victor Fleming is in the movie. On film Scarlett is portrayed as a ball-breaker - which to a certain extent she most commendably is! - whereas in the book we see her thought processes and we understand why she is like she is. She's a tough cookie who is simply unprepared to have nothing 'coz her contemporaries harp on about honour and the good old days. She's MOVIN'! Plus in the book we see a far darker Rhett than the role interpreted by Clark Gable. He's cool, he's a bad boy, he's loaded, but let's face it, the guy's got problems! He knew what he was getting into when he met Ms O'Hara, but he still pursued her for years. He's got some gall to turn round and moan that she isn't the way he wanted her to be, believing he could have changed her and made her love him. And then when she discovers it for herself... well Scarlett, the game's over! I'm not interested anymore. But hey, we still love him, he still packs a punch more than Frank, Charles and that stupid Ashley and he keeps you guessing. Does she get him back? Probably eventually. Scarlett has screwed up by being such a foolhardy hothead, but give her a break! With Melanie gone, she's got no pals and you know Scarlett will honour her promise and look out for Ashley... urgh! With any luck the man will get abducted by aliens and everyone can get on with their lives!",
            "Set in the Civil War era in Georgia, Margaret Mitchell's runaway classic Gone With the Wind is the spellbinding historical fiction of the world's best-known southern belle Scarlett O'Hara and the infamous Rhett Butler. The book was later made into one of the most successful films in history, starring Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable as the love-to-hate main characters. Normally, one would despise a person so spoiled and selfish as Scarlett, but Margaret Mitchell writes the emerald-eyed belle and the other characters in the book as multi-faceted, understandable characters, all with surprisingly human emotions and interactions. Through all of her struggles in the course of the novel, Scarlett stays strong, and in the end her will survives and she concludes a strong woman hopeful of what tomorrow will bring. Gone With the Wind is magnificent in its entirety, so complete with accurate historical facts and an unpredictable plot. The narrator follows Scarlett through years of her life, pre-, neo- and post- civil war, building at a quick pace. Scarlett rises again after the deaths of many close to her, after her failed marriage to Rhett, after going home to her beloved plantation of Tara during Reconstruction to find everything gone, and after her unrequited love for Ashley. The book closes with Scarlett pronouncing the famous words, &quot;After all, tomorrow is another day!&quot; Poignant and absolutely enchanting, Gone With the Wind is a book I would recommend to anyone. It cannot be guaranteed that you will enjoy it as I did, but from reading this novel you will gain insight about a true struggle and eventual survival.",
            "I recently downloaded the book, `Gone With The Wind' to my Kindle. It's not because I haven't read the book - far from it! Like millions of readers world-wide, I have already savoured every page of this best-selling listed book of all time in hardback, at least twice so far. I was 6 years old when my grandmother first noticed me looking intently at her copy of `Gone With The Wind' in her bookcase. And it was shortly after my grandmother passed away a few months later that the very same book was placed gently into my hands to keep (as was her request).There have been so many book reviews about `Gone With The Wind', authored by Margaret Mitchell, that I was almost tempted not to write this review. It seems somewhat pointless in repeating what has already been written countless times about this masterpiece, and the only book ever published by this author in 1936, who received a Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for it, in 1937. With over 30 million sales, a film, and sequel attempts by other authors in attempts to keep the `Gone With The Wind' saga alive, it is a book well known, world-wide.For those unfamiliar; set in the state of Georgia, southern United States in 1861, `Gone With The Wind' is the story of the high spirited, un-conforming southern belle Scarlett O'Hara and her tumultuous struggles of the heart, with (southern gentleman) Ashley Wilkes and (charming rogue) Rhett Butler. But it is not just a romance novel; it is also a novel bathed in American history, and the story of a young woman's determination and strength of will to save her beloved plantation home called Tara in any way possible, through times of the American Civil War and the early years of Reconstruction.I cannot recall why I was so captivated by this book when I looked at it on my grandmother's book shelf all those years ago (it did not have a colourful outside cover). I certainly wasn't at an age to fully comprehend the contents of it, despite the fact that as a child growing up in the Australian bush in the 1960's, reading was a huge part of my childhood, especially as my mother and grandmother were both teachers. However, once I read the book I realised that my grandmother would have known I would relate to Scarlett's love of the land; her home, Tara, which she fought to protect at any cost.My favourite excerpts:-Gerald O'Hara (Scarlett's father): `'Do you mean to tell me, Katie Scarlett O'Hara, that Tara, that land doesn't mean anything to you? Why, land is the only thing in the world worth workin' for, worth fightin' for, worth dyin' for, because it's the only thing that lasts.''\"Somewhere, on the long road that wound through those four years, the girl with her sachet and dancing slippers, had slipped away, and there was left a woman with sharp green eyes, who counted pennies and turned her hands to many menial tasks, a woman to whom nothing was left from the wreckage, except the indestructible red earth on which she stood.\"`Gone With The Wind' will appeal to readers for so many different reasons. I highly recommend it!J M Lennox",
            "Oh wow!! I was utterly and completely engrossed with this book. Mitchell did an incredible job on being very descriptive of everything. As I read I can really picture the scenery, the characters, and the war especially. Scarlet annoyed me and it was devastating how selfish, cruel, and cold hearted she was. Nevertheless, I couldn't put the book down. I was interested to see on what would become of her and Rhett, and Melanie and Ashley. The ending was a tear jerker for me especially for what happened to Melanie. The author did well on creating so much depth into this novel. Don't be intimidated by the long and many pages of this book. It was worth reading.",
            "Saying you know the story of \"Gone With the Wind,\" because you've seen the movie is like saying you know Kansas from watching \"The Wizard of Oz.\" Compressed and with composite characters, the brilliant movie doesn't hold a candle to the novel upon which it is based. The novel has undergone much criticism, for black dialect (which we studied, along with other dialects in History of the English Language), for rosy portrayals of slavery, and for being a forbidden romance that happens to have the Civil War as its background.\"Gone With the Wind,\" is more than a novel; it is an experience. Scarlett O'Hara is devout with faith---in herself, and is a survivor. The true tragedy of the book is that she is blinded by her ignorance into ignoring true love when it was present, and longing after an idealized love with a married friend. The book is lush with descriptions of the period, and very accurate in its detail. Scarlett is externally strong, with fragile emotions, while her foil Melanie Hamilton Wilkes is internally strong, with character and devotion that run deep. Ashley Wilkes is rather pathetic in that he never has the integrity to admit a lust for his childhood friend Scarlett but not romantic love, while Rhett, in many ways like Scarlett, and older and wiser, loves her for who she really is, not the face that society of the time demands she show in public. The story is mostly about character development in the face of tragedy, and shows three survivors with one \"displaced person,\" forever malcontent in the new world that the War has created, out of place, sad, and futile.A word about the slavery element: slavery was NOT a good thing. Not all slaves were named after their owners or treated as trusted members of the family or confidantes. Aside from Rhett, Mammy is the only person who knows Scarlett, what she is capable of, and chastises her for her lack of morals or values. I feel her character is critiqued based upon her speech patterns, not her actual actions. With the exception of Prissy, none of the African-Americans appear to be ridiculed or used for comic effect, nor do stereotypes surface. Pork, Dilcey, Mammy, and Prissy are fortunate that the emotional ties they shared with the O'Haras continued so much that they remain as paid staff after being freed. Cruelty from others is also depicted, usually in the form of Northerners who didn't understand the way of life.What remains is a tale of what happens when one's way of life and world are turned upside down, and how the principal character handles it, and relates with the others, failing at times to recognize the quality of friendship from her sister-in-law Melanie and the weakness of Ashley Wilkes. I quite wonder if Mittie Bulloch Roosevelt felt this way, when the enchanting Clayton County belle (from whom some of Scarlett's physical traits seem drawn) moved to New York State with new husband Theodore Roosevelt, Sr.While not all elements of the novel are positive, GWTW is a snapshot album of life during the Civil War and Reconstruction.",
            "In my humble opinion, Gone with the Wind is THE great American novel. It is brilliant, incredibly well-written, and highly enjoyable to read. It is at times charming, romantic, or bitingly funny, and at other times dark, cold, or heartbreaking. And always, it has the Civil War-era history as its dramatic backdrop. Its characters are fascinating and complex, though FAR from perfect. This book has everything, and its appeal is timeless.I first read the book as a young girl, after a couple of friends at school has been reading it and were enthralled by it when we were all about 13. I read it starting one Christmas break, and could hardly put it down. It's such a long epic, yet so fast-paced, that you just become lost in it. That's the very best way to enjoy a novel- to just become fully engrossed. The way it worked out for me was perfect too, because when I read it that first time, I had never seen the movie. (My parents had probably watched it a few times when I was little, since they love the movie, but I was too young to pay much attention). I knew nothing about the characters or storyline before reading it, and that just made it all the better. Of course, at that age I loved Rhett Butler and the love story aspect the most! Some of it was over my head or too \"worldy\" for me to understand then. Realizing this, I have since read the book again as an adult (I'm now in my late 20's and have seen the movie several times also). I loved the book just as much as the first time around, and certainly as an adult I got much more out of the historical elements, descriptions of the countryside, and the whole storyline.I would really encourage anyone who has only seen the movie to read the book. I do love the movie; It was incredible for its time, and is a classic itself; but to me it doesn't even compare to the book. Just watching the movie, you only get a sense of the most shallow outline of the story, without understanding much of its depth, character development, or wit. This is especially true in the second half, which was a bit rushed in the movie.A slight pet peeve of mine: Some people comment on Gone With the Wind being \"racist\" or \"sexist,\" as if that somehow detracts from its quality. Quite the contrary...Not only is that overstating the obvious, that's part of the point!! OF COURSE the characters' racist viewpoints were condescending and horrible. But they were historically realistic. The entire nation of the 19th century was shamelessly racist, especially aristocracy in the deep South, and this story is told from their point of view. Why read classic literature or historic fiction at all, if the past must be sugar-coated for modern sensibilities? There is nothing to be learned from that. OF COURSE some of the attitudes toward ladies seem old-fashioned now. That goes without saying. But that is part of its charm and helps to explain why Scarlett is as conniving as she is. She's no fool! The Old South had its faults and cruelties (namely slavery) but largely as a result of those faults, it also did not survive. GWTW portrays this fall. Thus, there is so much to be learned from the book, historically and morally. Its very brilliance is the way it captures a snapshot of that long-lost culture, from its most beautiful and genteel qualities to its faults that ended up being its downfall, and portrays it changing with the war. The Old South is \"gone with the wind\" but will forever be alive in the pages of this great American novel.Margaret Mitchell depicts the Southerners as what they were: just people, same as the Yankees, trying to defend their own and to sacrifice and to courageously fight for their side as they thought was right, in their stubbornly proud way. And after, when they had been humbled, they were trying to just pick up the pieces and survive, in a cruelly war-ravaged land. The only world they had ever known was ripped out from under them. Gone with the Wind follows Scarlett and our fictional storyline as it parallels every step of the historic timeline, through Reconstruction.In so many ways, Scarlett herself is like the South. In my mind, I feel like she represents the South. As the final page of the book describes, in one of my favorite lines: \"......With the spirit of her people who would not know defeat even when it stared them in the face, she raised her chin. She could get Rhett back.\"",
            "There's probably nothing I can say about Gone With the Wind that hasn't already been said, but I'm going to put in a plug for it anyway, because it's an incredible book and because a large number of people (most probably haven't read it) just don't get it--I'm talking particularly about those who think it's a romance novel.Gone With the Wind is incredible for its value as historical fiction. Written in the early 20th century by an author who grew up hearing stories about the Civil War and Reconstruction, it recreates that era far more successfully than any modern-day writer could. I've lived most of my life within a half-day's drive of Atlanta, but had never heard the South's perspective in the Civil War laid out as it is here. Some have complained that the book is racist, but to me, that's part of the point. This is no whitewashed, modern-day version of what Southerners thought in the 1860s; instead, it's a priceless and sometimes surprising reproduction of what they really thought and how that culture (very different from today's South!) operated.Aside from the beautiful portrayals of the people, places and events of the time period, there's some good action--those turned off by long books will be surprised at how readable this one is. The main characters, like them or hate them, are well-developed. And, yes, they have love lives. But then, we're modern readers, even if Scarlett isn't, so we should be used to that, right?",
            "I read this book as a little girl of nine or ten. Then I reread it and reread it until I practically had it memorized. No other book has affected me like this, and I've read many other books, including many of the great classics of literature. I have yet to find another Gone With the Wind.This book is life changing. To those who dismiss it as sexist racist trash, I would argue this: If describing reality as it is is sexist and racist, perhaps that simply reflects that there is a great deal of sexism and racism in reality. Were the people of the South prior and after the Civil War racist? Yes. Of course. Were these sexist times? Yes. Does it glorify sexism and racism.Perhaps. It is only fair to give this last question some consideration. There are sentiments in this book that are racist. I think of the feelings expressed of longing for the old days, the days of slavery, expressed by the main characters. But these are certainly feelings that were held by the people who clung so steadfastly to that way of life.I do not agree that all of the African Americans were portrayed as stupid. Even Prissy, in her own way, was not stupid. She was a detestable character, black or white, but not necessarily stupid, just daydreamy. But Mammy is anything but stupid. She certainly has a greater understanding of Scarlett than Scarlett's own mother ever did.Sexist?I don't know if this makes me a \"sexist\" but I have never identified with a character as much as I did Scarlett. It was as if I were reading the thoughts in my own head. She is manipulative, headstrong, stubborn, narcissistic, a dreamer, a romantic, and ultimately a realist, who stays in reality, and stays strong by clinging to certain rocks as her world changes around her. Rocks like her farm, Tara. And I love that. I love that when everything else is blown away from her, she clings to the things she learned to value in her childhood. \"Land,\" her father had told her, \"Land is the only thing worth fighting for.\"This book has given me strength throughout my life. I don't cling to the land, because I have none to cling to. But I cling to the things that give me a sense of something permanent and unchanging in my world, and especially when times seem unstable, and change seems to ruthlessly rip out all the familiar structures I have around me.",
            "I absolutely loved this book! I have to admit that when I first started reading the book, I had no idea what it was about. I read the beginning and was apauled to find out that I was reading a book about slave owners (I was a bit close-minded). After many assurances from family members that it was a very good book, I continued reading...and could not put it down.This book opened my mind to alot of possibilities. I really liked seeing the civil war from this perspective. Even though this is a fiction book, it did shed a different light on some of the events that took place in that time period. I enjoyed learning about some of the customs of this period and why they had them.Scarlett's constant battle with who she is and who she wants to be makes for some interesting situations. I found my own ideas of the characters changing with every page as new information was given of each one. Though I didn't like some of Scarlett's choices, I was able to understand why she made each one. You never know when something good or bad is going to happen in this book...it could be the next paragraph.This is a really long book, but it's worth every page. I think Margaret Mitchell did a great job writing it. It will definately be a book that I recommend to everyone I know.",
            "Great book just as I knew it would be. I can't believe that I've never read it til now. The movie itself is one of my all-time favorites, but they changed quite a few things which bugs me & the book's so much better. I can't wait to read \"Scarlett\" the sequel...",
            "I know this film so well and often quote dialogue but had never read the book. My first purchase on the Kindle and off camping. A thousand pages of southern saga sweeping off the page. It amazed me how the characters in the book are simply written descriptions of the eventual actors. You would recognise Clark Gable and Vivienne Leigh, even Melanie and Ashley like old friends. It was amazing. Also made me understand better a few things in the movie that were not clear to me - the Ku Klux Klan for example.If you are a fan of the movie but had never read the book - do so. It may be from the 1930's but the story holds, as does the film. Well worth the read and a great camping weekend relax.",
            "It's no wonder this is the second most sold book in history. The movie just doesn't do the book justice; the book really puts you in the south during the Civil War. Great read!",
            "It took me until age 35 to read this book. So glad I did! I read it over a two month span and was so sorry to reach the end.",
            "Truly a classic by Margaret Mitchell. This was one book I read and loved since high school days, and that was forty plus years ago. The literary style with its vivid descriptions is excellent - the unforgettable civil war of the late 1800's,the rebuilding of the beautiful Tara estate, and of course the emotional stirrings and passion of both Scarlet O' Hara and Rhett Butler. All these and more bring us back to the good old days and the lessons that we have learned to value through the times.",
            "BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ. I ORDERED FOR MY KINDLE AND I HAVE IN PAPERBACK. BUY AND ENJOY SCARLETT AND RHETT",
            "This is my second time reading Gone With the Wind (I read it once in high school) and it didn't disappoint the second time around. In fact, I think I love it even more now, with a little life experience under my belt. Just a pleasure to read.",
            "This is a rich, breathtaking classic that can (and should) be read over and over again. It is a long, long story spanning twelve eventful years, but it is definitely worth the time it takes to read. The book is like an epic - Margaret Mitchell's voice is powerful, poetic, wise. Characters are the most important element of a book for me, and this book has the most beautiful, complex, unique characters I have ever encountered in a work of fiction. Scarlett never ceases to amaze me - her resourcefulness and ambition are incredible for a woman of her time. It is incredible how tragedy transforms her - from flighty and carefree to a harsh, driven woman whose compelling desire is to return to the security and prosperity before the war. She is also a frustrating protagonist in her narrow-minded stubbornness and inability to understand others and her own heart. Rhett Butler is the other character in this novel that captivates me. Readers will love his subtle sarcasm, sharp wit, and suave mannerisms. It's impossible not to! He is the quintessential \"bad boy\" that countless authors have tried to recreate. But he runs deep too, especially in his love for Scarlett and sentimentality for the charm of the Old South.The historical fiction aspect of the novel is extraordinary as well. I fell in love with the deep South as Mitchell described it, even though I have no connection to that part of America. I never considered the plight of Southerners during and after the Civil War, but this book revealed its devastating effect on the people and customs of the South. Books about the destruction of a society rarely end happily. But it surprised and disheartened me when the author paralleled Scarlett and Rhett's love story with the downfall of the South.",
            "I loved Gone with the Wind.. The time period was a crucial time for shaping America as we now know it. So many things stand out in my mind from the book but the one that I see the most is the relationship between Scarlett and Rhett. I think we know he loves her from the moment on the stairs at Twelve Oaks.. Scarlett to me seems like our modern day power hungry woman.. going against tradition in a mans world and proving a woman can survive..however she did marry Mr. Kennedy..but he was just a means to an end.. nothing more to her but a way to get what she wanted.. Then again like many modern day women her children were not anyone she really cared to be around and left them in the care of others while she worked hard to get the money she so wanted.. I think Scarlett always loved Rhett and did not know it till the end and when she found out she saw that she finally had all the money she could need but she did not have the one thing that could truley make her happy.. LOVE.. The story left me a little sad because of all that the people went through during those years of war and reconstruction.. but with those changing times we saw the freedom that so many deserved and the way of life of the South forever changed (regardless of those who can not seem to except that after all these years) I myself am a southerner and I can say that there were many things about the old south that seem magical..but so many others that were just plain wrong. Gone with the Wind shows so much of the Old South and of all the characters I think Mammy was the strongest and smartest of them all.. She was a woman that could tell you right from wrong in a world that you thought you knew everything and she stood by her \"family\" through more than blood kin would have.. Gone with the Wind is a must have on any book shelf.",
            "This is my all time favorite. My Nana lived five houses away from MM in Ansley Park, an Atlanta suburb. She pointed out the house many times, she must have thought I wasn't listening. Nana, a staunch Presbyterian finally broke down and read the book, considered somewhat scandalous. (my mother said that Nana disappeared for days until she finished it...and did like it) Margaret was a bit ahead of her time...wanting to be a journalist, to work where only men were permitted. Finally, just to get her off their back...The Atlanta Constitution hired her to cover the homicide division. She flourished.She married Red, then divorced him but they would \"meet up\" from time to time. Apparently there was ample chemistry. She fashioned Rhett Butler after her handsome rogue of a husband so much so that MGM required Margaret to get a release from him fearing some kind of lawsuit. He signed it gladly, happy for the likeness.I first read the book at age 16 and have since read it five more times. The research for its historical accuracy, the language, the complex characters, the rich texture of the tale and then the FABULOUS ending! Still impressive. Pulitzer Prize, movie, MM's only book, has moved me in a different way each time I sit down with it.",
            "It's hard to believe that I'd never read GWTW. I've seen the film multiple times and I know a bit about the history of the novel. _Gone With the Wind_ sold more than 1,000,000 copies in the six months after it was released in 1936, and a year later Mitchell was awarded the Pulitzer prize for her effort. It's certainly one of the best-loved books of our century, with fans ranging from feminists who are trying to reclaim Scarlett to groups like the United Daughters of the Confederacy.So when I picked up the book, my biggest question was whether or not it was worth so much fuss and adoration. I suppose that my answer has to be 'yes'. Mitchell's writing style is occasionally uneven and it took me 50 pages to get used to her diction, but the story is so sweeping and the characters so well-realized that all concerns about style and tone were lost in the experience of the book.In many ways, I found the book a much stronger story than emerges in the film. Unhampered by censorship, the world that Scarlett moves in in the book is much uglier than the one in the film-- painful miscarriages, brothels, wounds and poverty fill Mitchell's picture of the post-war south and make Scarlett's character much stronger and much less petulant than she emerges in the film.Although daunting in length, I found that the pages literally flew by, and I was sorry in the end when the story closed. Definitely a 'should read'.",
            "Unlike the movie, this book is NOT a \"romance novel\"; it's a hard-hitting account of Southern life during the Civil War, told from a Southern point of view, told as if from the period. The racist attitudes of the time, though naturally, entirely unsavory from today's point of view, existed, and denying it won't erase the facts. Mitchell WASN'T trying to make a statement of ANY kind, pro or con; she merely wrote on how things were, as opposed to how one wished they might be, or wished them to be different. The dichotomies between black and white life are entirely realistic, and to portray them as anything otherwise would be foolhardy. The only way to know how ghastly our history was in terms of its treatment of humanity is to preserve the facts as they were, and this book, without even trying, does exactly that.Too, it would be a serious mistake to paint this book as an idyllic, romantic love story. Mitchell, to her credit, does not fall back on dime-store novel clich&eacute;s, and unfortunately, she is rarely accorded respect for this. Because of the movie, an entirely different, not altogether flattering, slant permeates the whole \"Gone With The Wind\" phenomenon - and which debased Mitchell's intentions in the appalling Alexandra Ripley sequel.If everyone who saw the film had read the book, realization might be more widespread as to how they differ, and how much more complex and sharply drawn are the characters.Scarlett and Rhett are two unapologetic opportunists who are startlingly lacking in typical \"storybook\" appeal. Instead, their \"appeal\" is in how earthy and shrewd they both are, survivors by discarding public approval and approbation. In the end, both are humbled (\"redeemed\" is too strong a word) by life and their chronic misunderstanding of each other - and wind up, naturally, alone. Mitchell, shrewdly enough, in a rare move of unsentimentality, does not go the \"happily ever after\" route - Rhett leaves Scarlett, ruthlessly, abruptly. How could Butler, after being so shabbily treated, retain his self-respect by staying with Scarlett? All the other characters are drawn with wonderful strokes of originality and vividness - human, flawed and far more appealing than the pastel versions portrayed in the film.Mitchell was an incredible vernacular writer, and her skills in doing so emphasized the differences between all the cultures, classes and races. Astonishing is Mitchell's ability to combine history, social commentary and fiction with unbelievable ease; after several hours of reading, the reader may feel as though he had been in a virtual time machine, so indelibly detailed are the locales, weather, sounds and even smells. Even more absorbing are the marvelous dialogues between the characters, especially those of Rhett and Scarlett. Mitchell had a grasp as to how humans interact through words, and unlike, say, Ayn Rand, the conversations sound as if they are spoken by real people.Finally, though, for those who thought that Mitchell was Olde-Tyme in her attitudes and conventions because she was able to depict them so vividly, I suggest the reader pay close attention to the character of Rhett Butler, and his disdain for Old South values. Mitchell pulled a fast one by revealing, through Butler's character, just how modern a thinker she was. Butler repeatedly upbraids Scarlett for her early adherence to an antiquated \"value system\" and mockingly scorns the society around him. He sees what a sham and fakery of all the conventions that exist, and of having to accede to a mass-mentality. Through Rhett Butler, Mitchell slyly tucks in her own incredibly multi-faceted, intellectually-based mindset.Mitchell's book is one of the true greats in American novels.",
            "Roseywater, I don't like this book because it is racist. According to your \"racist\" point of view we all should consider that the Odissey is not a good work because it is also racist, we shouldn't like \"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\" because it is racist, we shouldn't like \"The Great Gatsby\" because it is classist, etc, etc, etc.You should leave out that way of criticism and appreaciate the essence of human relations that surfaces in this wonderful story. The book is not racist, some characters are. But remember this is a book that explores how people were in the 1860s in the Southern US and it would be unrealistic if some characters, or many of them, were not portrayed as racist.",
            "Thirty plus years ago, I lived and breathed \"Gone With the Wind\" in one huge, invigorating, life-changing gulp. I am writing this review because there is a whole new generation out there that should be exposed to this ground-breaking book.Epic in scope at over 1,000 pages, \"Gone With the Wind\" is a story of the Civil War, set in the deep South. The central charater is the infamous Scarlett O'Hara, a tempestuous, beautiful southern belle who secretly loves Ashley Wilkes, a childhood friend who marries his saintly cousin Melanie. At their engagement barbeque, Scarlett meets the dashing, mysterious Rhett Butler, the black sheep of a distinguished Charleston family. This event marks the last day of their antebellum lives, and sets the stage for the ravages of war that follow. Covering a time frame of roughly twelve years, \"GWTW\" is also a story of the new South that rises from the ashes of the old.Scarlett, one of the most indelible characters of modern fiction, is ruthless and selfish, a survivor and a fighter. A feminist long before her time, Scarlett pays dearly for the choices she makes. Rhett is a more complex individual with one weakness. He hides his love for Scarlett, prefering to pop in and out of her life until he \"catches her between husbands\". It is Rhett who is the more sympathetic character, deeply intelligent, self-mocking and sometimes heartbreakingly sad. Rhett, in spite of his worldly ways, is more representative of the old south, while Scarlett depicts the new.\"Gone With the Wind\" is fabulously well-written, plotted and researched. It has been criticized as racist, and it is so. No author today could get away with these portrayals of African Americans. But you have to remember that this book was written in the 1930s. Keep that in mind if you become angry. Personally, I feel that Mammy is one of the strongest, noblest women to appear in a work of fiction.This work is a must read for everyone. Savor it, reread it and be moved as many before you have been.",
            "The book was excellent, however it was missing page 713. It had page 813 in its place. Therefore the book had page 813 displayed twice in the book. I also went to a local bookstore and noticed all 4 books by this publisher had the same problem.",
            "Does anybody not already know the story? Well just in case, be warned there are spoilers ahead.First, let's get this out of the way: Margaret Mitchell's \"Gone With the Wind,\" a story of the Civil War and Reconstruction in Georgia, is racist, and it paints a falsely idyllic portrait of slavery. There's no getting around it. Blacks are depicted as the functional equivalent of small children or draft animals who are best off under the loving care and protection of their white masters. They fulfill a narrative role similar to that of the dog Enzo in \"The Art of Racing In the Rain,\" devoted servants who are sometimes loyal to the point of heroism, and occasionally wise observers of their owners. Slave owners are kindly taskmasters, willing to spend thousands of dollars to buy slaves they don't need from other plantations to keep families together, loath to use harsh words or inflict discipline, and generously concerned with their slaves' physical and spiritual welfare. Slaves laugh in their cozy cabins and have comfortable clothes, plentiful food and attentive medical care. The \"better class\" of slaves recognize how good they have it and stay with their masters after the Emancipation Proclamation. Abolitionists are ignorant outsiders who don't want anything to do with black people and who can't even imagine the family feeling masters share with their slaves. You can make all the excuses you want about where Margaret Mitchell was from, the stories she heard as a child, and prevailing attitudes when this book was published in the 1930s. I know of no other American novel of comparable \"classic\" status that contains such a sustained portrayal of slave owner benevolence and black inferiority.That said, and I don't think these concerns are small matters, \"Gone With the Wind\" works brilliantly as a popular novel. To be sure, it has its flaws. If you like minimalism, you will find much of the prose overripe. There are more characters and scenes than are strictly necessary, even allowing for the vast historic scope of the story. I could do with a bit less wallowing in the red clay soil of north Georgia. The operatically star-crossed romance of Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara does not bear too close inspection.GWTW works so well nonetheless because Margaret Mitchell is touched with genius when it comes to structure, pacing, and characterization. As another reviewer put it, she has incisive insight into the human heart. She also has the good sense to leave her readers guessing all the way to the end. We can each draw our own conclusions as to whether Scarlett will get Rhett back. Aspiring novelists and novelists who want to write better novels would do well to study GWTW regularly.Reading this book again for the first time in decades, after many heart-fluttering trips through as a dreamy, lonely adolescent girl, I was floored by Mitchell's skill at setting scene after scene that grabs the reader's attention, drives the story forward, and tempts you to read \"just one more\" until the clock is ticking into the small hours of the morning and the sky through the crack in the window blind slips from black to gray. Mitchell's prose flows (sorry, cliche ahead) like a clear, swift-moving stream. It's not the highest art, but it's miles above most popular fiction.The characters, archetypes though they may be, are as vividly alive as any I can remember. Even before I re-read GWTW, I could, from memory, have told you all about Scarlett's childish willfulness, shrewd business acumen, lack of insight, fierce love of the land and insane commitment to keeping her word. I'd forgotten her occasionally touching acts of kindness, such as when, after her father dies in a riding accident, she gives his gold watch to his body servant, Pork, with no visible ulterior motive. I could have told you about Melanie's steely gentility, Ashley's dreamy weakness, Mammy's wisdom, Gerald O'Hara's sweet madness, and Ellen O'Hara's suicidal devotion to duty as she saw it. Rhett Butler is a wonderfully complex, infuriating character whose conflicts and sorrows come from his being a gentleman (at least by the standards of his culture) in spite of his own better judgment. The fact that people react so strongly to Scarlett, Rhett and the rest, favorably or not, is testament to Mitchell's having made them so real that we believe in them even when our rational minds suggest we do otherwise.Mitchell does a remarkable job capturing universal human emotions and frailties: the fearful, loving relationship a small child has with his mercurial mother, the wisdom that there can be happiness only when like marries like, the stubborn folly of romantic regret, the pain and blame that come to a couple when a beloved child dies, or the inability to see others as they really are, whether it's the strength of steel under a genteel, innocent exterior or a vulnerable, devoted heart lurking behind a sardonic facade.Every tragedy needs its comic relief. A seldom-noted feature of GWTW is Mitchell's humor. She directs a sharp wit at the hypocrisy of Old Guard Atlanta and affectionate humor at the child characters she, a childless woman herself, handles with such insight and aplomb.Pat Conroy's introduction does a nice job as far as it goes in explaining how GWTW shaped the inner lives of generations of women, especially Southern women and how it will always be popular in countries that lost a war. Beyond that, I think GWTW's popularity endures in spite of its cringe-inducing attitudes for a couple of reasons. First, it's an early story of female self-sufficiency. Driven by fear of poverty, aided by a sharp mind, a solid work ethic and scruples that are none too fine, Scarlett makes her own money. Not for her the ladylike impoverished widow's pursuits of millinery, baking, or boardinghouse operation, or the unladylike pursuit of a brothel. Instead, she goes into the building trades, buying and running lumber mills, competing as sharply as any man in the business. Second, it's a quintessentially American story of, as Mitchell herself put it, \"gumption.\" In the world of GWTW, anyone with enough gumption can triumph over any adversity. GWTW reflects something so deeply ingrained in the American psyche that it will have an audience as long as anybody anywhere believes in the American archetype of the self-made person.In spite of its flaws, GWTW deserves its place in the top rank of popular fiction.",
            "This book was wonderful. I love reading about the south and the Civil War era is a wonderful back drop for the story of the spoiled southern belle Scarlett, and the dashing Rhett. I personally feel that this book is the mother of historical romance and will last the test of time. I read this book the first time when I was 12 or 13 and re-read it again as an adult. My memory of this story was not altered by the length of time between these reads.Better then the movie and wonderfully descriptive with real characters that grow as a result of their experiences you will not be disappointed with this book.",
            "5+ stars! I have read Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind 3 times over my 60 years and it still ranks in my top 2 greatest books ever written. It is an American Masterpiece. A classic of its time. Epic in scope, it is simply a good story that you never want to end. Happy, sad, contrite, vengeful, mean, loving, mysterious, hypocritical; yes, it has all the human emotions and foibles of life and more. To borrow a line from Charles Dickens' Tale of Two Cities: \"It was the best of times, it was the worst of time\", but most of all it was their times.One of the vary best books ever written concerning character development. Ms. Mitchell was superb. Her use of emotion and empathy made the characters come alive and it was as if they were in the room with you.To say more about this wonderful American classic would be redundant and hyperbole.It is an absolute must read. A true American classic masterpiece.*Note: I have seen the movie many times and it too is an American classic. Stunning in character portrayal and scenery. BUT, the book has the broad scope and in-depth character development that the movie could never portray unless it was many hours longer. Simply put, The book Rules!!",
            "Being a guy this is kind of hard for me to admit, but this is the best book that I have ever read to date. I know that this is a \"chick book\" but I found it completely fascinating. I learned much more about the civil war from this book than I ever did from a history book or a classroom. I also learned about the origination of the KKK, all about slavery and all about real southern hospitality. There is so much more to this book than just a great story. You actually get to feel what it would have been like to grow up and live on a plantation before, during and after the civil war. I believe that this book should be read by everyone because of its historical value even though the story itself is fiction. I have read very few books where you really know and feel for the characters like you do in GONE WITH THE WIND.",
            "A fourteen year old who loves to read almost anything under the sun:I loved this book. When I was in seventh grade I checked it out of our little school library because it had a lot of points--we'd read books, take a test, and receive a certain number of points for that book. If we got everything correct, we got full points, and we needed many points to pass English every trimester.I didn't realize I was going to fall in love with the characters. Each person is beautifully made, intricate, and unique. You grow to know everyone in the story. Margaret Mitchell doesn't let any detail slide. She describes Scarlett beautifully.Scarlett is perhaps the most interesting character I've ever read. I hate her completely, and yet love her just the same. She was the most spoiled brat, and yet I felt like I was part of her, or she was part of me.Also, Margaret Mitchell does a good job of justifying the Confederate's reasons for breaking off from the United States. Although I don't agree with slavery at all, I could see where the southerners came off, believing as they did, and even felt a little angry at the northerners for being so hotheaded themselves.For those of you who have seen the movie and liked it, buy this book, its ten times better. And for those of you who disliked the movie, still get the book. It is very much different from the movie, you get in the whole world, and they left out so much in the movie. For instance, Scarlett ... well, just read it, it's good.",
            "This novel singlehandedly got me addicted to reading! I thought I didn't have time in my busy schedule, but now I make time! I never wanted this book to end!",
            "I had always been a fan of the movie adaptation of Maragret Mitchell's \"Gone With the Wind\" but I had never gotten around to reading the book (I know--BAD READER!) so when I saw audible had a version of GWTW available, I decided to try it out. It's a long book but I figured my familiarity with the story line would help me through it.Why did I wait so long to read this book--it was wonderful! So much more than the movie, with additional detail and real perspective on the characters. Those overwraught emotions make so much more sense after reading the book! Although there is a rich historical background in this novel, it's really about one woman's struggle against herself, her time, and her enemies.I also really enjoyed the narrator of this audio book. She did a wonderful job of bringing the story alive and giving depth to the different characters (with different voices and inflections) and had a wonderful way of telling the story.If you are a fan of GWTW the movie and have never read the book, I urge you to get out there and find a copy. You won't be disappointed with this rich historical drama.",
            "romance, history, tears... the book is a master piece... if the ending gave me more, i would have jumped with joy but... still it is a really good book... teaches you from the perspective of the south and even makes you feel so sorry for scarlet... i never really liked rhett because he just didn't seem like he loved her.. i guess he sort of didn't.. well it was wonderful^^",
            "I read this book the first time when I was 14, after the re-release of the movie. I saw that the book had been re-released on a visit to the library, and checked it out. Well, a casual reader cannot read \"Gone with the Wind\" in the one week the library gives you for new books, so I bought this copy from Amazon, and took it with me on a 10 day vacation. Almost done reading it. Think I will read \"Scarlet\" next.",

            "Wow, the civil war from the southern POV, who knew? Yes, racism is rampant, but I loathe history and I loved this book.",
            "I absolutely LOVED the book! I never would have read the book, but I read a review somewhere that someone said don't wait until you're 50 years old like her to read the book. It was very easy to read and I enjoyed the author's writing style. Even though the book was Fiction, Mitchell wrote it with realistic and actual events of the pre/post Civil War. I had a great and better understanding of why the Southerners thought the way they did about the Yankees and continue to grasp their love for their land, values, and ideals of the Old South even to this day.I had seen the movie, \"Gone with the Wind\" a few years back but didn't get a true appreciation of it of why it was such a great movie, and after reading the book, I purchased the DVD. Having read the book, it was easy to follow and understand the movie which doesn't always capture the true essence of the book.I am on a pursuit of reading classic novels and this was on my list. Take the time to read this book...it is quite large so it will take some time to read but is well worth it.",
            "This wonderful book deserves 10 stars at least. I just re-read it and, even now 30 years after I first read it, it still stands head and shoulders above any other work of fiction I've ever read.There is good reason why GWTW remains so enduringly popular. First of all is Margaret Mitchell's wonderful verbosity; this allows her to describe the physical setting in lush detail and to create characters of enduring interest and complexity. When it comes to characterization, no author I've ever read can even touch Margaret Mitchell's skill.But what also makes GWTW so enduring popular is its readability. Except for Scarlett's occasional \"Fiddle-dee-dee\" and \"God's nightgown!\" and the almost unintelligible dialogue of the blacks, Gone With the Wind reads like something written by a modern day author. The language is simple and direct and forthright, never complex or flowery. This gives the book a timelessness and makes it, even at 900+ pages, an amazingly fast read.Although reading GWTW this time as a middle-aged adult I found it far more tragic and sad and far less romantic, what I appreciated more about it was the background story and the way the author worked it seamlessly into her narrative. She vividly describes the effects of the war and Reconstruction on Southern society in a way that is evocative without ever sounding bitter or angry.If you've never read GWTW then you owe it to yourself to do so immediately if not sooner! Trust me, you'll never be sorry that you did. The characters of Rhett, Scarlett, Ashley and Melanie will become like real people who will live on in your mind forever.",
            "In time for the Diamond Anniversary of the publication of this formidable American classic, as well as the 150th anniversary of the Civil War that it depicts, I present my editorial musings about Margaret Mitchell's iconic literary piece.As an African American, it was a touchy and sometimes uncomfortable read for me. But as a child of Barbadians, my ancestors had been free for roughly 30 years by the time the story begins, and as subjects of the British Crown, had the option of attending British Universities, whereas America was on the verge of its most catastrophic war, in which slavery was a major issue, and Jim Crow laws would succeed slavery, I can and did read this novel with a little more detachment than most African Americans could.It took me 17 days to complete it, my eyes flowing faciley over the pages of the Avon Book rendition.Margaret Mitchell introduces her heroine, Katie Scarlett O'Hara, a willful green-eyed beauty of Franco-Irish descent, on an April day in 1861, where the 16-year-old is entertaining two suitors, the Tarleton Twins, on the front porch of her family's Georgia plantation, Tara.The lanky handsome red-haired Tarleton Twins, Stuart, and Brent, had been expelled from college,but were planning to join the Confederate Army, and they begin to aggravate their coquettish young hostess with their frequent talk of war. Scarlett threatens to go inside and lock herself away if they fail to change the topic of conversation, and is obliged. In due time, of course, the young Southern Belle would have to shed her preconceived notions about war as a gender-segregated issue, and accept it as everyone's business, regardless of gender.In the meantime, the topic turns to the upcoming barbecue at the neighboring Wilkes plantation, Twelve Oaks, where the handsome, blond Ashley Wilkes, whom Scarlet desires above all others, resides with his widowered father, John, and sisters, India and Honey. She learns Ashley will marry his cousin, Melanie Hamilton, who is sweet, delicate, and of a milder mold than she, who despises her.Literally turning into something of a green-eyed monster, Scarlett schemes to steal Ashley from Melanie--a central plot in the story.Her firey Irish father, Gerald, discourages her pursuit of Ashley, knowing such a union would be an unhappy one. Like most of the men closest to Scarlett, he had her best interest at heart.Her mother, Ellen Robillard O'Hara, from a notable French family from Savannah, tends to the plantation, nursing the sick, settling the accounts of the estate, and spending ample time delivering and baptizing the out-of-wedlock children of the impoverished Emmie Slattery, who are fathered by the O'Hara's Yankee overseer, Jonas Wikerson.Although better educated that the lowly Slatteries, his profession bars him from association with Georgia's upper echelon. So he turns to the lowly Slattereys for companionship.Ellen asks her husband to fire Wilkerson for his immorality, but Gerald refuses.Ellen appears too busy to really notice her oldest daughter's intrigues.The evening ritual of family prayers provides some temporary solace for Scarlett, who has quarreled with younger sisters Careen (baptized Caroline Irene) and Sue Ellen(baptized Susan Elinor). Servants Mammy, Pork, Dilcey, and Prissy stand guard as Ellen leads the family in Roman Catholic breviaries.Mammy knows Scarlett best, and calls her out as her charges prepares to attend the barbecue, but Scarlett has ways of manipulating Mammy to get her way.At the barbecue, Scarlett shines. In due time, it is revealed that all the men who will play a pivotal role in her life are there. She gathers her suitors under a tree, flushed and flirtatious.In the meantime, a mysterious man from Charleston with a murky reputation has his eye on the raven-haired beauty. As Scarlett is winning men's hearts, this man, Rhett Butler, earns the ire of the same men by giving them a realistic account of their chances of defeating the Yankees, as he has visited Northern factories, and areas of that region many of John Wilkes' guests had not.Gradually, it will be seen that Rhett Butler is right, and most of the men quarreling with him are dead.Slipping away from the rooms where the young ladies are napping, Scarlett confronts Ashley in the library to reveal her feelings, and is gently rebuffed. In a tearful rage, she slaps the man she claims to love and throws a china bowl decorated with roses, smashing it, and startling Rhett, who had been sleeping on the couch, initially out of her sight. Her response to his remarks about her behavior reveal her to be unsure of her own mind where Ashley is concerned.Amid Scarlett's dealing with the hurtful sniping of other young ladies, the word gets out that recruits are called for and all eligible men, including Ashley, rush off to enlist.A moment of desperate jealousy towards Ashley and Melanie leads Scarlett into an ill-conceived union with Melanie's brother, Charles--the day before Ashley and Melanie's marriage--. Charles dies of illness while at war, leaving Scarlett widowed and pregnant with their son, Wade, with whom, like many parents in wartime, Scarlett will have difficulty bonding.During a visit with her Aunt Pittypat, the widow scandalizes Atlanta by dancing with blockade runner Rhett at a ball benefitting the troops, while clad in widow's weeds.The story follows the young beauty through nursing soldiers with Dr. Meade and a pregnant Melanie, her frustration with Prissy during Melanie's labor(Prissy's simplemindedness was most likely a ruse as it was for most slaves), and her perilous flight back to Tara from Atlanta despite bad weather and battles, during which Rhett journeys with her only part of the way before rushing off to enlist.With Melanie, Wade, Prissy and newborn Beau in tow, she returns to find Tara still standing, unlike Twelve Oaks, although blighted by soldier's lootings, Mammy, Pork, and Dilcey about the only remaining servants, her sisters ailing, her father non compos mentos, and her mother dead of typhoid fever contracted from nursing Emmie Slattery.Finding only rotten produce to eat, she vows to rebuild her life by any means necessary, and as the saying goes, \"There is nothing angrier than an educated Southern lady.\"Using all her cunning, education,and inner strength unleashed by harsh circumstances, she acheives her goal at the expense of many friendships, marrying twice more, bearing daughters Ella(by Frank Kennedy, the \"old maid in britches\" she steals from sister, Sue Ellen when she realizes his business can help pay the taxes on Tara) and Bonnie(by Rhett) along the way--the last of whose strong will matches her mother's, leading to grave consequences.In a very poignant ending, Scarlett does come to appreciate how much Melanie really means to her, seeing how her kindness and fortitude complemented and buttressed her own grit and determination, and she finally sees Ashley as a hopeless and perpetual dreamer in view of her own willingness to face and deal with life's realities head-on.Intriguing characters include the amputee soldier, Will Benteen,and the crude Hillbilly, Archie, whose history proves the practice of Honor Death was not confined to Mid-Eastern culture. Both show how the war brought disparate social groups together, as does Madame Belle Watling.The political incorrectness, mysogyny, and racism may ruffle a few feathers. But it is appreciated that these people were products of their time, although impressively, Scarlett's mother forbade her to use the \"N\" word.Still, this story is an American epic that reflects the resilience of a human spirit that never conceded defeat.I recall that during a televised airing of the film version of this epic in the early 1980s, the announcer referred to Scarlett as \"The Jewel of Tara\", and indeed, in facing life's great calamities, she does prove to be \"Diamond hard\".",
            "\"Burdens are for shoulders strong enough to carry them\"Tara Plantation, near Jonesborough, near Atlanta, GeorgiaKatie \"Scarlett\" O'Hara is the most charming Southern belle, gathering the attention of beaux all over the surrounding areas. But when she learns the man she had been psuedo-courting, Ashley Wilkes, is marrying Melanie Hamilton from Atlanta, his cousin, she schemes to win him back. When he refuses, she immediately marries Charles Hamilton in spite. But Civil War has come to the South, and Scarlett quickly finds herself a widow, stuck in Atlanta, with a child, unable to be the pretty belle she had been a few months prior. Will Scarlett ever get Ashley? What about the strange Rhett Butler character, who is constantly tweaking her? Will Scarlett and her family survive the war?Let me preface my review with this: I don't read a lot of historical fiction or chick lit or romance or anything. My speciality is science fiction, fantasy, and urban fantasy. However, this book absolutely, positively blew me away!At first, I found the novel a bit slow. There were so many characters, and at first, it seemed like nothing happened. But that wasn't to last. Quickly, I became interested in Scarlett's schemes to snatch Ashley away from Melanie, all the while hating her for her bad behavior. By the end of the book, there were points were I was in near tears.Scarlett wasn't my favorite character. She was a rude, bitter, selfish woman. But I completely understood her predicament. To the reader, she was completely honest, despising her first husband's death (and life!), her dislike of children (don't see that much in romance do we!), her dislike of women's poor station (always having to act \"silly\" in front of the menfolk), and taking the reigns of business to make a life of her own. So while I didn't like her, I also didn't hate her. I understood what she was trying to do and found myself rooting for her against the odds. She is a brilliantly written character, so dynamic, multifaceted and full.Melanie Hamilton was probably my favorite character. This might seem odd as she does come off as a Mary Sue--perfect and sweet to everyone, always right, yada, yada--and I hate Mary Sues. But I really never found Melanie a Mary Sue. Scarlett repeatedly downplays Melanie's beauty. Melanie is strong-willed and works diligently, but tires easily (such as when she works at Tara in the cotton fields). Like Scarlett, Melanie was definitely not a 1-D character. She appeared weak on the outside, while maintaining strenght in the face of danger, in the face of childbirth, in the face of hard times. She was a true inspiration to me.Rhett Butler made me so furious, sometimes I wanted to slap him like Scarlett! But other times, he was so charming and debonair, that I wanted to melt in his arms like butter. I loved how forthright he was, how practical and realistic he was, and yet how at times, his passionate nature came through (joining the Confederate army at the end, for example).Side characters, such as Miss Pittypat, Mammy, Dilcey, Pork, Uncle Peter, Mrs. Meade, Belle Watling, and more, jumped out at me. They felt like real people, people influenced by dreams, desires, and feelings. Probably one of the sweetest moments was when Dr. and Mrs. Meade were talking and she mentioned she would rather him be at Belle's than dead. Given what Mrs. Meade had been through, what she held dear, it was particularly poignant.I could go on endlessly about the amazing life lessons and themes and symbols in the book. Quotes about the status of women at the time, about changing with the changing times, about strength of character, about being who you are, and about what is really important in life abound in this book. Most of the ones that really touched me may be found on my profile page, though the whole book is brimming with it.As this deals with the South during the Civil War, there is much talk of slavery; one of the reasons, I believe, it has been so frequently placed on the Banned Books list. Some people believe that it shows slavery in a favorable light, that blacks were/are children that need to be tended by whites. My opinion is this: it shows how many white Southern plantation owners viewed slaves. Not all slave owners were Mr. Simon Legree of Uncle Tom's Cabin. Conversely, not all slave owners are like the O'Hara's. Yes, there are a lot of black stereotypes (Mammy, Prissy, etc.), but this is a snapshot into the past. You can't take this book and try to force modern views of civil rights and racism into it. However, I do believe it makes a brilliant discussion piece: comparing Scarlett and other Southern whites' views of blacks with other accounts (such as Uncle Tom's Cabin or the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn).All in all, this is a brilliant book, made more excellent by the narrator, who deftly interprets the Southern dialect and accents for the listener. I thoroughly enjoyed it and was heart-broken, but inspired, when it ended. I highly recommend, even to those, like me, who aren't big into historical fiction.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*",
            "I am 16 years old and finished Gone With The Wind a few months ago. This is the most amazing story I have ever had the pleasure to lay my eyes upon. I have had an obsession with Gone With The Wind for quite some time and I read anything and everything I can about this novel and the film, my all time favorite movie. This is an amazingly captivating novel. Margaret Mitchell is perhaps the greatest author in American history. She is a literary goddess and her timeless characters have left a huge impression upon me. People say that the greatest tragedy in literary history is Romeo and Juliet...I think not! When I finished reading Gone With The Wind I realized that those people were wrong...when Rhett leaves Scarlett after all of her pleading and apologizing...it is undescribable in human terminology. Mitchell's amazing recount of the Civil War, the Old South, and the lives that were touched by both is unparalleled in the history of recorded language...I have become ! extremely interested in the history of the Old South and the greatest American crisis-the Civil War. This novel is by far a literary phenomenon...it will never be equalled or surpassed! I feel priveleged to have been able to read this book and I thank Ms. Mitchell for writing this paramount spectacle.",
            "&quot; Un-put-a-downable.&quot; When I started reading this book, I completely lost track of time. I became so hooked on the romance between Scarlett and Rhett, I just thought about it for days and days. I convinced my friends to read it, and they were addicted to it also. The film Gone with the Wind is superb, I imagine Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable perfectly as the two! The descriptions and wit in the novel is unsurpassed, by the end of the novel I felt like I knew Scarlett &quot; down the her bones&quot;. Very few books made me laugh aloud, gasp, sigh, and cry--this is one of them. Every time I pass the book on my shelf. I want to read it again. Once you get started..it's hell to stop. The sequel is pretty good, I just needed more of Rhett and Scarlett to keep thinking of. I wish terribly that Margaret Mitchell had written more for us to eternally cherish. Bless that woman!",
            "Visit a time when women were &quot;hoop-skirted&quot; ladies and men treated them with charming, exaggerated kindness and respect. Take a ride in a horse carriage to a ball, and there be introduced to some of the most memorable people you'll ever meet. I'm refering to the exciting experience of Gone With The Wind. Nothing you ever read will captivate, motivate, affect, or teach you more. The characters are so real that they become part of your life, they change your life.

            "This book was virtually transferring me back into time like a time machine..you live the book, you feel the book, you \"see\" the book..you are there..with Scarlett, Rhett, Mammy, Melanie, and Ashley..unbelievably emotional at all extremes..I love it and will be glad to re-read it.",
            "When I first picked up Gone with the Wind, it seemed impossibly large. However, halfway through the second page, I began noticing that the words were flying by, and my world was slowly grinding to a halt. Everything stopped so I could continue reading. The book was absolutely enthralling. The chemistry and romance between Rhett and Scarlett was so incredibly well written that I could see sparks flying out of their eyes, and here the firecrackers crackling as they traded insults. Even if they didnt know that they were perfect for eachother, we knew. After reading this book, I have come to the conclusion that, not only is Margaret Mitchell a phenomenal American writer, but she also is one of the best people to describe the South during and around the Civil War time period. She completely deserved the Pultizer Prize that she won, and I will continue to pass on the message about this amazing book. Such an archetypal novel should be timeless; it will never die out or become obsolete.",
            "well, ok, the cover looks like a romance novel and i wouldnt be caught dead without some kind of a dust jacket.it was very engaging and a fast read though its size can be daunting. with colorful discreptions, wonderful prose and excllient character development it is well worth the time it takes to finish it. it's one of the few books i would say is much better than the movie. you'll be glad you read it.",
            "Originally, I fell in love with the movie. The book is the same characters but weaves a deeper story rich in language, history and description. Mitchell's love of Atlanta and knowledge of the South makes this novel so inviting. Don't let the length be offsetting this book reads itself it flows so smoothly.",
            "I would give this 10 stars if I could. I haven't read this since I was a young girl in the early 70's and should never have waited so long to read it again. The characters were exceptionally well drawn, the dialogue was brilliant, particularly between Rhett (SIGH!) and Scarlett. I swear there was sparks flying off the pages. I am going to miss the people I will have to put behind me now that the book has come to an end, Rhett (SIGH), Scarlett, Mammy, Prissy and Aunt Pitty Pat (LOL).The author's use of prose was beautiful, all the scenes and action came alive for me. Some people seem to be offended by the racism in the book, but that's how things were back then. Sugar coating it would have ruined the story reducing it to a Harlequin romance.This is an incredibly well written book about the death of a civilization and the struggles to survive in the new era. This is a book that should not be missed, particulary those who enjoy historical fiction.",
            "I actually discorved Gone with the Wind when I was eleven, and it is an interesting story. I was in a race against a classmate to find the longest book in the school library, read it, and pass the test on it before she did. I read it, wondered why they put a book like that in an elementary school, took the test, passed and basked in the glory or beating someone. But when it was time to return my copy to the library I was disappointed, and renewed it three times until the librarian made me give it back. Then, months later I was visiting my grandmother (she lived in Texas, I in Nebraska) and noticed that she had a copy of the book (with a sticker on the front that said 50 cents.). I took it out of the shelf and started to read it, and when my grandma found me reading it, she said she never liked it and gave it to me. Bam. Love at first page. I read it three times and got the sequel from the public library (not bad, but it will never compare to the original), and saw both the GWTW movie and the 'Scarlett' miniseries, before I was twelve.I am always reading Gone with the Wind. My old copy is hidden away somewhere, but I bought myself a new one in slightly better condition. I am in ove with this book. I read it late at night every singe night, and when I finish the book I instantly start again. I have yet to find any book by any author that could possibly stand up to this novel. To anyone to is considering this book but can't decide-buy this book. The money you pay for this piece of writing will be the most well-spent money you've ever given for a book. This is an unforgettable tale with two of the greatest characters of all time. Need I say more?",
            "This vivid tale of the Civil War and Reconstruction is not idealism (as reviews calling it racist imply) but realism. The rich characterizations and deep plot reveal its author to be one of profound understanding, not only of human nature and of life itself, but also of the forgotten, overlooked, untaught aspects of war and racial strife.Observe the polemics of those who call it racist. I dare say that that charge would be made by the same people of any book using any approbrious terminology whatever, regardless of the context.Also, as you read the negative reviews, notice the consistent lack of specifics of those who doubt its historical validity. There will not be one single example. This is part of their method of deterence, and they have nothing but hollow, unsupported invective. Anyone who needs clarification is welcome to email me.I am a constant reader, and I found Gone With the Wind not only sublime in its narrative and poetic in its dialogue, but an excellent adventure into the &quot;house of cards&quot; that was the lives of the Southern aristocracy.",
            "Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler are classic charecters along with the rest of them. They're as classic as the story. So much history is in the book. It gives a clear and good picture of how it was during that time. Everything isn't perfect. I'm 11 years old. That may seem too young to understand such a classic love story but I did. It was even better than other love stories like Wuthering Heights or Jane Eyre. Not to say they aren't classics. Ms. Mitchell writes the story clearly and comes straight to the point unlike for instance Henry James who takes up 2 pages to describe a woman's dress. If you read one love story in your life or watch one movie make it Gone with the Wind.",
            "As with all great classics, I am hard-pressed to say anything original about Gone With the Wind. This is my second reading and I still love the book. If you have seen the movie, but have not read the book, read the book. There is a great deal more that will only add to your enjoyment of the storyline.Some things I did not know about Margaret Mitchell made re-reading the book all the more interesting (thank you Wikipedia). Mitchell's maternal great-grandfather was from Ireland and settled on a slaveholding plantation in Georgia. Her grandfather fought in the Civil War and made a lot of money in the lumber business after the war (just like Scarlett!). As a young girl, Mitchell heard a lot of Civil War stories from her relatives and visited the ruined plantations in Georgia. And, most interesting to me was that her mother was a women's rights activist.I think these points are important because they give you a better understanding of the characters in GWTW. And I think the most interesting point is Mitchell's portrayal of Scarlett as a shrewd and independent businesswoman during a time when no women ran businesses or even played a role in commerce, except maybe in selling pies like Mrs. Merriwether and taking in sewing and boarders like Mrs. Elsing. (Or Belle Watling's business. Belle's character is also quite modern, profession aside.) Mitchell also portrays Ellen, Scarlett's mother, as the true head of the plantation, with Gerald as a figurehead.Although I love this book, it is difficult to read the sections about slavery and the slaves on the O'Hara plantation. The O'Haras take pride in their kind treatment of their slaves, yet the O'Haras and other plantation owners come off as very condescending. And who knows whether kind treatment was common on all southern plantations. It's a bad part of American history and all accounts of this time-period make you cringe. But I think it's important to note that some of Mitchell's slave characters (Mammy, Pork, Uncle Peter) are smarter and wiser than their owners.I think Mitchell's description of the post-war period is very good and it shows what a mess Atlanta was and how the Southern way of life known and loved by its people was forever lost. I like how the characters, particularly Melanie and her followers cling to their committees and old customs, even when the Northerners take over the city.There are certainly many, many other points to add about the characters and the book, Melanie's goodness, Ashley's displacement in the new South, and Scarlett's inability to understand and appreciate the people around her until it is too late.I like Rhett Butler the best. He is very modern, thinking it ridiculous never to mention pregnancy and birth control. He loves children and these things make him even more appealing. You want to forget how he makes his money, his drinking and what he does over at Belle's house because he is so likeable and smooth. His flirtatious conversations with Scarlett are so fun to read, but my favorite parts are when Rhett shows his true feelings to Melanie, and sadly to Scarlett at the end.",
            "Simply put, Gone With The Wind is a masterpiece of epic proportions. It doesn't get any better than this. The movie by comparison is an utter waste of time. I have read Gone With The Wind over and over again and it never gets old. I couldn't recommend a book more.",
            "I never saw the classic movie Gone With the Wind until I was in my late teens. But I had read the book. Of course I'd heard of the movie, and I had a vague idea that it was a romance tale set during the Civil War. But something drew me to it. Perhaps I picked up that it was an epic tale, or something similar.Anyway, one day while walking through a book store while in my early teens, I decided it was time I learned what all the fuss was about. Being a guy, I didn't expect to find much to like, but I figured I give the novel a chance.I'm glad I did.Yes, at its heart, Gone With the Wind is a romance story, though some might consider it a tragedy since (SPOILER ALERT) the romance dies in the end, but I loved the story.The characters were grand. The backdrop was ... well, it was epic, truth be told. The plotting was somewhat complex without being overly complicated. And it was pretty good writing.So why should I shun a novel just because it's romance? Because I'm a guy? That's silly.Especially considering, at least in my own opinion, this novel is so much more than just a romance. Believe me, as a form of education I've read a few romance novels. None of them come close to anything like Gone With the Wind.No bodice ripping here. There a scream or two from the heroine, but they're at appropriate times. And what a heroine! Scarlett O'hara is no wilting violet waiting for a man to save the day. No, she has no problems standing up for herself, maybe too much at times. In fact, Scarlett's hard-headedness is one of the character's tragic flaws within the novel.Okay, if you're one of those guy readers who thinks you could never pick up a romance novel, do yourself a favor and read Gone With the Wind. Though it's set in the American Civil War, you're not going to find page after page of descriptions of troop movements and battles and all that jazz. But you will find complex, interesting characters who are as real, as bold, and sometimes as weak as any found in the best literature of the world.",
            "This is the classic tale of wanting what you can't have ... until you can. Romance aside, this book is chock full of history, drama, suspense, emotional turmoil and philosophical whimsy. It's peppered with a dry, cynical wittiness that will keep you, not only turning pages, but smiling, laughing, and even occasionally gasping incredulously. Especially whenever the irresistible Rhett Butler enters a scene.The dialogue is simply smashing. The characters are realistic and resonate on a soul deep level. This is something that the movie version was, understandably, unable to pull off. Scarlett came across as a one dimensional, selfish, cold hearted monster on the big screen. In the book, however, we have behind the scenes access to her mind, heart, will and emotions. When this story is appreciated in literary form, one finds it difficult to either love or hate her entirely because, just as in reality, there are too many shades of gray.I have seen some people label this book as racist and intolerant. While I agree that there are some rather uncomfortable themes and an indisputable usage of inappropriate language, readers must bear in mind that this is a work of fiction depicting the culture and mind sets of characters living during the Civil War period. If the story had been written in any other way, it would have detracted from the authenticity of the tale. That being said, if you are sensitive to such things, you should probably steer clear.As far as I am concerned, this is a must read for any fan of historical fiction. Yet, I must warn you; Don't expect a happy or conclusive ending lest you be disappointed. After reading Forever Amber and many Anita Shreve books, I am always emotionally prepared for such a let down. Still, that didn't stop me from turning the last page of Gone With The Wind, anxiously looking for more. I was breathless with wonder, racked with unanswered questions, passionately angry at fate and, of course, torn between love and hate. When you really stop to think about it though, how could two personalities as dashingly quixotic as Scarlett and Rhett be expected to depart in any other fashion?",
            "I read GWTW one summer when I was a teenager, and got completely absorbed in it. I woke up one morning to the smell of bacon and stretched luxuriously in my bed as if I were Scarlett. Margaret Mitchell created a rich view of the antebellum south and characters that seemed real, making it easy for a reader to feel the horrors of the Civil War and empathize with the characters. Mitchell once said that Scarlett was a hussy, so I guess she was, but I never saw her that way. To me, she was a strong young woman who was forced out of her pampered world, determined to seize control of the future instead of cowering in a corner, even if it made her a social outcast.",
            "Margaret Mitchell wrote one of the most popular novels of all time. Set against the breath-taking backdrop of the red hills of Georgia during the American Civil War, Gone With the Wind is a window into a society that was swept away by war. Although I must say I doubt the portrayal of slavery is authentic in this work, every other aspect must be accurate. I have read some background information on Mitchell and, to my knowledge, she spent a significant amount of time researching every detail of her story--even down to the time of day that the list of deaths from the Battle of Gettysburg arrived in Atlanta.As a Southerner, I am proud of Mitchell's success and her novel. I would have to say that this is my favorite novel of all time--a great epic about the South and its storied past.However, as vast as the setting may be, it's easy to forget that there are two different plots going on: that of Georgia, and the South, during the Civil War, and that of Scarlett O'Hara and her struggle of hunger, poverty, love, and much more. The timing that Margaret Mitchell used in her novel (i.e. the death of Melanie, thus setting Ashley free; but at the same time realizing she, Scarlett, loved Rhett all along.) is amazing. However, the last part, Part V, moves a bit fast. But I suppose you can't dwell on 12 years worth of dialogue and narrative...I would recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys a historical novel. Although this book has been known since its publication as a romance, I would say that Gone With the Wind is anything but a modern romance--it is the epitome of what a romance SHOULD be.",
            "Gone With the Wind is one of those books that for years I've been telling myself I really should read, but other books just kept getting in the way. I finally decided pick it up, and couldn't put it down once I started it. It's such a wonderful story, and the ending is one of the best endings I've ever read in a book. The book is so much more than just a romance. I really wish Mitchell had written a sequel, because I would love to know what happens next to Scarlett (I know there are a few sequels out there by other authors, but to me that just isn't the same..I won't be reading them).One thing that was very hard for me to take was the extreme racism in the book. Of course, reading a book set in the South during slavery times and you know at least some of the characters will be racist. What surprised me though was how it is very apparent that Mitchell was very racist as well, and wasn't afraid to make her feelings about blacks and the South in general known. I really had to mentally block out some of Mitchell's attitudes in order to fully enjoy the book. At one point--around page 600, when Mitchell is describing the Restoration--I nearly had to set the book aside; it upset me so much. I'm glad I didn't though, because it is a great story, and one that will stay with me forever.",
            "The color red. It usually represents blood or love. However, Margaret Mitchell uses a little bit of both meanings in her description of Scarlett O'Hara, protagonist of Gone with the Wind. Scarlett represents two of the most powerful human emotions: love and hate. Gone with the Wind is truly classic American literature, as it encompasses such strong emotions and redefines the reader's historical understanding.It is hard to describe the level of feeling one gets from reading this book. Mitchell has loaded her story from cover to cover with strong details that take the reader on an intense voyage of human emotion. The reader can easily become involved in the story through this detail. The feelings Scarlett has for Ashley draw the reader back to his or her childhood. As Scarlett matures throughout the course of the novel, so too does the reader. Love, hate, anger and sorrow are all common emotions everyone experiences, and Mitchell uses her words to draw out these emotions from her readers so that they can truly understand Scarlett's character.They say that history is always written from the winner's perspective. This novel counters that, as it tells the story of the South from the South's perspective. For example, it provides a new point of view on Sherman's march to the sea, showing the way the Southern cities were affected and the feelings of the people living in them. Because the events are familiar to the reader, they stick out and maintain the reader's interest.Gone with the Wind is a classic in American literature, and is a touching story of a young woman experiencing life. Her name reflects her various personality traits, and makes for an interesting story. Everyone should read this book, but make sure you have plenty of time, as it is quite a lengthy book. Also, while extremely touching and a fun read, it can be difficult at times due to the broken Southern used as dialogue. Despite these few drawbacks, the novel is highly recommended to anyone who enjoys curling up with a good book and becoming emotionally part of the story. It is a good story that reflects the many aspects found in the color red.",
            "I have had this book in my library for well over 10 years. I often picked it up, but never began to read it. I knew of all the hype about this being the great American epic novel and a Pulitzer Prize winner. I had seen the movie twice. The first time when I was maybe 8 when I saw it with my grandparents. The only thing I remember was asking my grandfather, \"Why is grandma crying?\" The second time I saw it, maybe five years ago, I was deeply disappointed in its lack of realism. Today's movies of blood and gore made the battle scenes and the long bloodless dolly shot of the wounded soldiers lying on the ground in Atlanta look plastic and fake. Another reason I neglected to read this book: 1024 pages. But, finally I decided to give it a shot, and am I glad I did. It is difficult to find the proper superlatives to use here. One plus, because of my busy schedule I had to read this in fits and starts, and it took over two months. However, author Mitchell has given us such strong and descriptive characters and has given so much detail to all of the plot twists and turns, that it was easy to return to the book and have complete remembrances of what has happened in the preceding pages. The story is compelling. Scarlett is a complex and fascinating heroine; Rhett her perfect antagonist. The minor characters all are well drawn. From the battle scenes, the aftermath, the period of reconstruction, what we have here is history come alive. I will cherish the hours I spent with this book. As a result, I will now search for a biography of Ms. Mitchell to learn why this was the only book this magnificent author ever wrote.",
            "I haven't been so engrossed in a book in a while. That's not to say I haven't read any good books lately, but there are some novels that take you hostage, laying siege to your thoughts until you can't think of anything else. You turn every single page, devouring them one by one. When it's over, you've ingested it and the story sticks inside you. It becomes so much a part of you that it's like looking through an old lens at something that happened to you a long time ago.Scarlett O'Hara has been forever ingrained in my brain as someone to aspire never to be like and someone to admire. She is completely oblivious to people and how they work-hurting feelings and breaking hearts-but she has gumption and ambition, which is admirable. Margaret Mitchell masterfully crafts a protagonist that is a completely different person on page 1,448 than she was on page 1, but still fundamentally the same. It's a brilliant blend of changing times and societies, a history lesson, a love story, a tragedy, and most of all a story of a person's capacity for change. I actually feel like there is nothing more I can say about this novel to do it justice.So, I suggest to anyone and everyone to read this book and not to be intimidated by the page count. It is honestly one of the best stories I've ever read; there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that this is rightly deemed a classic novel.",
            "I am a native Georgian, and I cannot believe I waited so long to read Gone With the Wind. Pat Conroy's new introduction finally got me to pick it up, and it simply is one of the best books I have ever read. It is magnificent. Winner of the Pulitzer Prize, it is a snapshot of a conquered nation and people - right here in the United States - and how they survive and persevere in the face of changing times, a lost war, and overwhelming odds.If your only exposure to Gone With the Wind is the film, you have so much more to discover. There are many important differences between the book and the film. ***SPOILER ALERT*** The book has many colorful characters sacrificed for the movie - Will Benteen, a Confederate Veteran who ends up running Tara and marrying one of Scarlett's sisters, Mrs. Tarleton (mother of the twins), Honey Wilkes (Ashley's sister), Uncle Henry Hamilton (Melanie and Charles' uncle), Dilcey (wife of Pork), and the much more fleshed out Aunt Pittypat and Belle Watling, just to name a few. In the book Scarlett has three children, one by each of her three husbands, instead of just Bonnie as portrayed in the film. Another major difference between the book and the film is that Rhett's motivations, background, and depth of feeling (and incredible suffering) comes through in the book in much more detail. In addition, by the end of the book I had a great affection for the quiet forgiveness, intelligence and iron-clad strength of Melanie that I felt was a bit lost in the film. Melanie truly is one of literature's greatest \"steel magnolias.\" ***END OF SPOILERS***I was very interested to read of Gone With the Wind's popularity overseas. It has been reported that the book has been translated into 40 foreign languages in 50 countries. It is amazingly popular in Japan, and in Germany more than 360,000 copies were sold by July 1941. I had never thought about it before, but Gone With the Wind was written during the late 1920's and 1930's about survival in the American south during and after the Civil War, at the same time Germany was suffering and rebuilding from its defeat in World War I. The European resistance movement during World War II found so much inspiration in the south's reaction to the Federal occupation in Gone With the Wind that the book was bootlegged during the war by the French Underground and other organizations. Orders actually went out from Germany at one point during World War II to \"seize all copies.\"During and after World War II people in rebuilding countries took the story of Gone With the Wind to heart. Margaret Mitchell stated, \"In practically every European country critics wrote at length of the 'universal historical significance.' Each nation applied to its own past history the story of the Confederate rise and fall and reconstruction. French critics spoke of 1870 (the Franco-Prussian War), Poles of the partitioning of their country, Germany of 1918 and the bitterness which followed, Czechs wrote not only of their troubled past but of their fears of the future, and I had letters from that country just before it went under (Nazi domination), saying that if the people of the South had risen again to freedom the people of Czechoslovakia could do likewise.\"The worldwide legacy of Gone With the Wind is truly astounding, and it all began right here in the Atlanta area with this book. Do not be put off by the book's size. Gone With the Wind is a real barn burner, and there is not a dull moment in the entire story. It is dramatic, brutal, romantic, amazingly intelligent, and quite shocking even by today's standards. The pages literally fly by. Read the first two chapters and if you are like me you will not be able to put it down. Margaret Mitchell's storytelling ability is an amazing thing to behold.Very highly recommended.",
            "This was my first read of \"Gone with the Wind\" and have to say it is by far some of the most vivid visual writing style I've encountered. The period style of writing and language used to describe scenery, events, people, class, style, emotions and action are simply riviting.Simply put: read the book.",
            "This was my first time reading this classic and I really didn't know what to expect. I had seen the movie version several times and in my opinion I really enjoyed the book so much more (Although the movie earns it's own merit's). It left me speechless and it really made me think about what Scarlett O'Hara had been through and it really made me for feel her and the other characters in the story. I was really impressed with the story Margaret Mitchell created. I can see why this got the Pulitzer Prize in 1937. If this has to be the book you choose for your next read, make it this one for sure!",
            "I read this book about 20 years ago, I am so glad I read again! Scarlett was ahead of her time and a very strong woman. Follow this book with the new Rhett Butler's People which I found very interesting.",
            "This is a new copy of an old favorite that I read to death. Have not read this one yet, but, I am sure that I will enjoy it as much as the other one.",
            "What a masterpiece! Enjoyed every chapter. Details in the book most interesting that were left out of the movie. Margaret Mitchell was a genius.",
            "I knew this book was a classic so I figured I would like the book. I didn't like it, I loved it. It took me three weeks to read but I still couldn't put it down. It kept me hooked to the end. I didn't know what to expect but it is a classic. Scarlett was a woman that was becoming modern but people and the times did not want it. I love her for what she did in the book and stood up for herself. The movie is as just as good as the book.",
            "This is a review YEARS in the making. First, I saw the movie on TV - bought the DVD and watch it at least once a year. Whenever I think of GWTW, I visualize Scarlett and her father at the oak tree at sunset...as the music swells. I enjoyed the story of a strong woman who truly believes that she is only trying to do her best for her family. Now. I said all that, to say this: the movie is nothing compared to the book! The book fleshes out the characters, life in the deep south, and the civil war. The book is long,yes, but there are no gratuitous descriptors - every word adds to your understanding of the people, the time, and the politics. After having the movie 'in my head' for so many years, believing that it was the story - I was delighted to find so much more in the book. I now read the book about once a year. This book is a must read for anyone whoever saw the movie; and for anyone looking for a real novel!",
            "Gone with the Wind, by Margaret Mitchell, is a stunning book which is sure to hold readers enthralled. Embark on an exciting journey, following the flirtatious Scarlett O'Hara, dashing blockade runner Rhett Butler, sweetness personified Melanie Hamilton, and the wistful Ashley Wilkes. Scarlett has always been a petulant, coquettish, southern belle. But too soon, the Civil War strikes, and Scarlett's perfect world shatters around her. Her beloved Ashley is married to Melly, a girl Scarlett feels is the perfect example of boredom. During the tragic, bloody years of the Civil War, the sardonic Rhett Butler enters Scarlett's life. This stunning book is not only a historical melodrama, but also a book that reflects the human heart and shows how Scarlett can change from a selfish person to a strong woman.",
            "This book is another world that I lose myself in while reading it. I get so involved with the story and plot that when Scarlett is dismal, I am dismal. When Scarlett is defiant, I am defiant. This book never fails to move me. While some people see it as a racist pledge to the Confederacy, I see it as the key to how the South felt about the war, about the Reconstruction, about life...",
            "Read this book. And then read the sequel by Alexandra Ripley. Gone with the Wind is THE BEST! Beautiful, witty, definitly involved. What I love about these two books is that I became the character. I had read about her so much that I knew her inside and out, and I like books that do that for me. Margaret Mitchell is truly amazing and Alexandra Ripley did an outstanding recreating Scarletts life.",
            "I first read this book at the age of ten and have re-read it at least 15 times over the last decade. With each reading, I admire Mitchell's characters more and more. Mitchell's pen has an unerring eye for the telling detail. Aside from Rhett and Scarlett's stormy love, I think one of the most complex and fascinating relationships in the book is that of Scarlett and Melanie. Although Scarlett thinks she hates Melanie, she really depends on her as a substitute mother, and whether she realizes it or not, her actions towards Melanie are truly generous and good. Melanie, for her part, seems to worship Scarlett almost to the point of idolatry, and from the Twelve Oaks Barbecue scene until her death at the end of the book, never ceases protecting Scarlett from her detractors - just like Ellen O'Hara. Melanie is the only person who can ease Scarlett's anxiety about her fog nightmares other than Rhett. One of the most tragic things about the story is that when Scarlett fina! lly realizes just how much she loves and needs Melanie and Rhett, they are both lost to her on the same day. I've always wished that Mitchell had written a second volume (the Ripley book is wretched!), although I myself don't really see how Scarlett could get Rhett back, and there are no other people in her life who could take Melanie's place. Mitchell's story is both inspirational - Scarlett offers many lessons on how to cope with adversity, sorrow, and loss - and a magnificent exploration of the complexities of the human heart and mind. Each time I read this book I almost forget where I am and what else I should be doing. Margaret Mitchell was a great storyteller. I wish this book was longer.",
            "This is an incredible book! I found it extremely hard to put down. Margaret Mitchell guids you through all of the human emothions with this one. I is a griping novel about this civil war and it truely shows you what a horrible thing war is. Although I have not had that much time to read many books I can easily say that this book is the best I have ever read. I would esily give it 6 stars!",
            "When I picked up this book, I expected a long romance novel about a woman and her lover. What I read kept me up until 3 a.m. trying to finish it in one sitting. I would reccommend it to anyone. The one star I removed was due to the fact that it sometimes became confusing, with all of the marriages and deaths. I loved it. I severely do NOT reccommend to ANYONE the sequel, Scarlett.",
            "This book, Gone With the Wind, was so beautifully written that it seemed like the characters came off the page. Scarlett was not just someone from a book, but actually someone who lived.The book was the tale of Scarlett O'Hara from when she was 16 till she was 28. At the beginning of the book, Scarlett, daughter of a wealthy plantation owner, is in love with Ashley Wilkes. But Ashley is to marry his timid cousin Melanie Hamilton. Scarlett is very upset, but ends up marrying Charles Hamilton, Melanie's (also timid) brother to hurt Ashley. But war starts, and the men go off. Scarlett starts to realize that the war isn't just an exciting, little game, and she meets Rhett Butler. During the siege of Atlanta, I held my breath, anxious to see what was next. Scarlett ends up marrying twice again and has 3 children Wade, Ella, and Bonnie.Excellent book! The movie was great too, though it left out some things. But if you want to read more details than the movie, read the book.",
            "Although this is the longest book I've ever read in my life (1024 pages in my edition), it wasn't long enough, and it never could be. I loved this book, and now that I've read it all i can say is that I'm glad there's a sequel. From the first few paes the book catches the readers and and wraps them up in it's pages, carrying them along with the life of Scarlett O'hara. We laugh with her, cry with her, feel her her emotions as if they were our own. You cannot stop thinking about the book, even though your mind should be on other things. The only desire is to keep reading and find out more, until the book finally lets go. Then the reader is left alone and confused, wondering what has happened, and where the story has gone. The book is a masterpiece, a novel in perfection, and my only regret is that this scale only goes from one to ten, for Gone With The Wind deserves a 100.",
            "First and foremost, Gone with the Wind has no mundane narratives, heartwarming and heart-rending from page 1 to 1448, 1448 was not enough!Brace thyself to be swept away by the Old South. If you heard this is a novel which glorifies racism and the age of slavery, you are misinformed; magnanimity is quite a virtue fellow savant.A captivating theme supported by characters with character, what more dost thou needeth? GWTW is a Pre-Civil War novel which portrays the monstrous adversities Southerners were manhandled to weather upon the slaughter of their civilization and way of life. For those attempting to prevail over a disheartening tragedy, GWTW shall inspire thee to walk the path of Rhett Butler or Scarlett O'Hara, for it once had for I (I, a former Ashley), though I held onto my chimerical nature. Wikipedia relays an excellent analysis of the characters, better than my own.People believe Southerners were fighting to defend slavery and the Confederacy, and I am sure a number of the arrogant wealthy landowners were, but the majority of Southerners were simply defending their homes and those they love. What would you do if an army was en route to your town and will pillage, burn, and commit unspeakable horrors unto your town's women, welcome 'em with open arms? Unlikely, unless you are gutless or a damn fool. You would, like I, commit monstrous acts to all extents, even if it were to leave you a corpse. I can go into historical detail debunking many fallacies people have about those who fought for the Confederacy, but it would serve little purpose, try reading the quote at the end of this review. GWTW is a Pulitzer Prize winner, it is doubtful that it would have been awarded such an honor if it were based on a horde of slack-jawed yokels praising slavery. GWTW is a novel of epic proportions, I highly recommend it.The 1939 film cannot compare in depth to the novel itself, but it is damn good for 1939. Clark Gable's performance was praiseworthy, such fiery passion, and Vivien Leigh, wow! What a powerhouse she is, almost intimidating, but in a cute classy way, if that makes sense, especially when she says \"I will not listen-\" (p. 1306)Memorable scene:Scarlett: [pleads with Rhett as he is about to leave to join the Confederate Army] Oh, Rhett! Please, don't go! You can't leave me! Please! I'll never forgive you!Rhett Butler: I'm not asking you to forgive me. I'll never understand or forgive myself. And if a bullet gets me, so help me, I'll laugh at myself for being an idiot. There's one thing I do know... and that is that I love you, Scarlett. In spite of you and me and the whole silly world going to pieces around us, I love you. Because we're alike. Bad lots, both of us. Selfish and shrewd. But able to look things in the eyes as we call them by their right names.Scarlett: [struggles] Don't hold me like that!Rhett Butler: [holds her tighter] Scarlett! Look at me! I've loved you more than I've ever loved any woman and I've waited for you longer than I've ever waited for any woman.[kisses her forhead]Scarlett: [turns her face away] Let me alone!Rhett Butler: [forces her to look him in the eyes] Here's a soldier of the South who loves you, Scarlett. Wants to feel your arms around him, wants to carry the memory of your kisses into battle with him. Never mind about loving me, you're a woman sending a soldier to his death with a beautiful memory. Scarlett! Kiss me! Kiss me... once...[he kisses her]Random quote from Gettysburg (1993):\"Virginians! Virginians! For your lands! For your homes! For your sweethearts! For your wives! For... Virginia! Forward... march!- Brigadier General Lewis Armistead",
            "I know, I know: another review of GWTW?Yes.Why? Because even after 72 years and billions of kudos, GWTW is still underrated. I was skeptical when I picked it up. But MM is one of the greatest writers of the 20th century, and she immediately hooks the reader. And she never lets up. And she spends the last third of the novel sucker-punching the reader over and over and over again, with each twist and turn more painful than the last. There's no one left to root for at the end of the book, and that's as it should be. Because it becomes clear that the characters in this novel (the adults, anyway) have all been playing a variety of dangerous games and, just like real life, they have to pay the price in the end.Scarlett is smart and courageous, but in the end she pays a price for her selfish behavior. Rhett is also smart and courageous, but at the end of the book he's a broken mess groping for his dignity and sanity. Melanie remains sane and dignified, but she's selfless to a fault (a characteristic which leads to her demise), and Ashley...well...This book makes me weep every time I read it. And yet I've read it at least 100 times. And keep coming back for more. Too bad all the sequels are so bad, but there's some fabulous fan fiction out there.",
            "If you read GWTW strictly as a love story,you're missing part of the picture,and I'm saying this as someone who DID read it as a love story many years ago at the age of twelve. And I don't mean just the surface historical picture either.It goes so much deeper.Scarlett is of course the central character,and to me,a metaphor for the \"New South\",in that she compromises with the new circumstances in order to survive.Melanie appeared to me as a symbol of the \"Old South\"-but the part of it that had integrity and strength.They needed each other in order to survive,and it took Scarlett until the end of the book to realise this.Ashley is the part of the Old South that couldn't adjust.Rhett is the person who though he despised the old ways and all they stood for until age and time made him begin to realise what he had thrown away.He still had a cynicism about it,but he also had an appreciation for the charm of a time that would never be again.As with many others,Scarlett was my favorite character in my first few readings,but I came to a new appreciation of Melanie over time. I began to see that she had a true quiet strength that Scarlett could never approach,one that didn't require her to compromise her principles and her loyalty,as Scarlett had to,in order to survive. The character of Ashley,on many further readings,doesn't appear quite as pathetic as before(though I never found him THAT pathetic in the first place).He was simply,as he tragically recognised,an anachronism in his time,a beautiful dream which evaporated under the harsh glare of a new reality.He was the part of the dream that Scarlett clung to,even as she clung to the ideal of her mother Ellen,never seeing the truth of these ideals-the honor,strength,and integrity of the dream,rather than the outward forms.This was HER tragedy-even though she was a survivor of a kind,she had to destroy all that was good in order to do so.Melanie had the true moral courage that allowed her to survive without destroying the good-to me,a much more difficult kind of survival.I'll need to read this book so many more times before I'll feel finally understand it all,if I ever will.I understand the old story,being born and raised in the South,of the struggle to hold on to your identity and still be a part of the world around you.I understand why The War can feel like yesterday-after all, most of it was fought on the soil here,and the losers always remember longer.I think the background of Scarlett's father,Gerald O'Hara from Ireland,neatly ties into this.Read and re-read this book,because everytime you do you'll find depths you didn't plumb before.There is so much symbolism to be explored,each reading will provoke new thoughts.",
            "Perhaps because it was made into a hit movie, this book is sometimes considered a &quot;romance novel&quot; instead of great literature. It is, in fact, one of the great American novels. Mitchell does not portray the antebellum South as an ideal but rather a doomed society, like the &quot;Tara&quot; of Irish myth. The characters are thoroughly developed and complex. A must read for anyone interested in the Civil War, women in fiction, and American literature.",
            "I absolutely loved Gone With the Wind. I read over the summer because it was one of the choices on my school reading list and my mother and sister had read it and loved it. I didnt expect to like it all that much, but I was hooked after the first ten pages. It has become my favorite book. I couldn't stop thinking about it when I finished. I have reread it at least three times, and I am still left with the same feeling I had the first time. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. I would give it ten stars if I could.",
            "I am sure that there are thousands who share the same feeling - there cudn't have been a more realistic &amp; close to heart character portayal than that done by Mitchell. One has to read the book to understand how it can affect a person. I am sure no female ever gets over Rhett Butler (not even when her hair has turned gray - example my English literature teacher at school) and no man can resist Scarlett's charms (they are in the same boat as that of other fictitious characters in this epic).A must read.",
            "&iexcl;Gone with the Wind&iexcl; is my all-time favorite novel. I&iexcl;m so obsessed with the book that I think about it every day, in spite that I&iexcl;ve read it for like a hundred times. I cannot tell why I cannot get enough of the book. I&iexcl;ve been trying to tell myself that it&iexcl;s just a book of 1000 pages, telling the story of a belle&iexcl;s maturity and struggles for living, yet I just can&iexcl;t cut off my bond with it.Due to the colorful plot and intriguing dialogues, my opinion about it changes with time. As I first read it during junior high, I viewed it as a moving love story. Oddly, there was a time that I really hated the novel because it inevitably posed discrimination on African Americans. Nevertheless, my love for it was resurrected on my way of learning to grow up, for I highly respect the female main character, Scarlett O&iexcl;hara&iexcl;s courage and passion for living. Above all, I can always get something from reading the book.With its vivid description, I can picture a broad land, a luxurious house, people&iexcl;s looks in my mind. Though the novel is already pretty lengthy, still some parts were unsaid, leaving to readers&iexcl; imagination. I guess that&iexcl;s one of the reasons that make the book so catchy and unforgettable. With its classic movie version, it&iexcl;s amazing that my thoughts about it remain unaffected.The book is generally true to its historic background, and since the author depicts female mind profoundly, I can easily comprehend the idea she tried to convey or the metaphors. When Scarlett is happy or heart-broken, it seems like I&iexcl;m just there on the scene, feeling the trouble or pleasure she is confronted with. And it&iexcl;s one of the few books that make women respectable and independent, causing me to identify with it even more.I won&iexcl;t deny the fact that I&iexcl;m an incurable fan of the novel. It enriches my life and somehow glorifies my imagination. I will follow the strong determination the book suggests: &iexcl;Never ever give up!&iexcl;",
            "Gone with the Wind is a wonderful book. I just finished reading it a few days ago and I was blown away.I loved and hated Scarlett .Even though the ending is heartwrenching, Scarlett took Rhett for granted and she'll get him back somehow, she always gets what wants. Up until I read this book I never realized how rough it was for the south during and after the Civil War.This is a must read, if the book doesn't interest you now, try it again later, that's what I did.!",
            "I cannot describe how great this book was. It was the best book I ever read and I know I will read it more than once. Gone with the Wind had such a charm to it that is bound to sweep you off your feet. If want a book that gets you hooked in the first line of &quot;Scarlett O'Hara was not beautiful, but men seldon realized it when caught by her charms, as the Tarleton twins were&quot; to the last lines of this heart-wrenching book, then this book is a sure way to be enveloped. It tells of the southern life during the Civil War. Even if you aren't interested in history, like I am not, you can still be sure you will love it. I recommend this book to anyone who has patience and who loves Love-stories.",
            "Gone with the wind was the best book I have ever read. It is utterly captivating. Scarlett, the main character in the book, is someone that everyone should strive to be unlike, but secretly, throughout the whole book, you are rooting for her. Even at the stupidest things, you cry when Scarlett feels distraught. It will come deep into your soul and play with you emotions until all you can do is focus all your energy into reading this book. From the beginning to the end, you won't be able to put it down. It is a great (and sometimes quite graphic) display of what the civil war does to people and their beings. You will not regret reading this book, in any way shape or form. It is the most tantalizing book you will ever read. It is a great love story of desperate unrequited love and of hidden emotions that never show themselves until; it is unfortunately, too late. Everyone should have the experience of reading a book that is so magical that you really will never forget the way you felt through each amazing chapter. It is a must read for people over the age of ten. It will make you blood curdle and go cold at almost the same instant. Don't pass up the opportunity to read this book about the infamous love triangle of Scarlett O'Hara, Rhett Buttler, and Ashley Wilks. Never again will you find a book so worthwhile.",
            "Are you looking for a book that will be refused to put down? Then you may have just hit the ultimate jackpot;Gone with the Wind is a flurry of different themes that come together in one book,each of which beckon the reader to follow word after word to the last period.From romance to adventure, this book brilliantly entwines descriptions that come alive and stir emotions from deep in your heart.The author,Margaret Mitchell, carefully picks out her characters to make a rather interesting and unique combination that make this novel come to life.Join Scarlett O'Hara,the once pampered belle of the County,as she fights to regain her old life's treasures after the destructive effects the Civil War.Some will be frustrated,others,left melancholy,but the outcome of this beloved story is guaranteed to be breathtaking,one way or another.",
            "There will never be another book to match the greatness of \"GONE WITH THE WIND\". No matter how many times I read it and re-read it I have always falling prey to it's spell of great reading. I don't care for other people who have a fanatical hatred for this book. It seems sad that these people who call this great classic racist are also the same people saying that the South deserved what it got and the southern people too got what they desereved. How can they even suggest such a thing? The killing of civilians, the pillaging, the murder of whole families and black ex-slaves, the stealing of homes, the burning of whole towns, civil liberties taking away when the south and it's people were doing their best to start again and be part of the Union again after the war, martial law being the order of the day for over five years, the robbing of state government money, over taxation again for the South and it's people after the war and after taxes being one of primary reasons for the the war, the murder of many more man and their families for being defiant against a Government that lied to them again, and all is being condoned by people who live now in the present who say the Southern people deserved what they got for having slaves and daring to follow what the Consitution allowed? the right of session. Do these people not know the law? history and American governmentworkins?, and the right of session being an American and constitutional right?. How sad. Gone With The Wind is a book. A great book. The story of Scarlett O'Hara and her fight to never be hungry again, her fight to never let the Yankees beat her, and her fight to keep Tara her land from the Yankees. Scarett is a role model for anyone who will do anything to survive when the time comes to keep from being poor. Whether she is spoiled, caculating, and shrewed or just plain mean she gets what she wants, just like I think she would have gotten Rhett back sooner or later. Or Rhett would have come back. He loved her too much and waited to long for her to just give her up easily. Remember how he waited till the burning of Atlanta to enlist in the Cause to save the Condfederacy, of course he would have returned back to her in the end. And for all the people who think slavery was the only issue pertaining to the civil war. Read your history. Not public school history or present history. Read real history before 1970. You'll get the history you were robbed from. Remember slavery was legal so that made it okay in the eyes of the law before the Civil War. It was legal. It didn't make it right. Abraham Lincoln too said he wasn't sending troops South to end slavery, he was sending troops to end the Antebellum South.",
            "What words can I use to desribe the power and solidness that make this book!The moment I picked it up out of curiousity I was long gone in a majestic tale of sweet southern plantations,raw human emotion,and ruthless war that fill these pages with more than words,but a life all its own.Scarlett is an inspiring heroin,who isn't good nor just but is bursting with such a need to live that you get instantly swept away in her desires,impatience, contempt,love,and ultimately her thirst for anything and everything she can't have!I'm a just over half through with it and I'm frankly scared to finish it.What will I do with out Rhett,Melanie,Ashley,Mammy,Suellen,Carreen,Aunt Pittypat,Gerald,Will,and all of them.Also the ones who have died from war or sickness as Ellen,Brent,Stuart,Charles,and the nameless faces that past on in a war that never should have been fought.This book has been an inspiration to me in all respects and I'll never forget a single word of it!P.S. The south should have won,we know that!",

All young adults studying the South and the Civil War period should be required to read Gone With the Wind and to see the movie as well. An enduring classic for all time, Gone With the Wind has been read three times by my young adult granddaughter, and I also have given it several readings! Great character development, setting, and realistic experiences that seal the characters and the time period forever in one's mind. And don't miss Scarlett, a follow-up by another author. Gone with the Wind -- a forever memorable reading experience!Evelyn Horan - teaher/counselor/authorJeannie, A Texas Frontier Girl Books One - Three",
            "When I read this book I could not for my life keep myself away from it. I was changed, I was inspired, and I was genuinely mpressed and surprised. I was flabberghasted that a woman in that era would have that attitude and daring,(I say this on the part of the author, as well as the protagonist). Read this book, and have more insight! Loved it.",
            "As others have said in their reviews, GWTW is a great book. To repeat all the reasons why would be quite redundant of me. Simply, I recommend GWTW if one wants to discover the white southern female point of view concerning the Civil War era American south. I also recommend Harriet Jacobs' &quot;Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl&quot; to anyone BRAVE enough to discover the black southern female slave point of view concerning the Civil War era American south. Seeing as GWTW is very long, and Ms. Jacobs' work is around 200 pages, I'd read &quot;Incidents&quot; first. It's another truly amazing literary work...an account of southern slavery from the pen of a former slave herself! There is much much interesting information concerning the relationship between mistress and female slave/house attendant that will provoke thought as one reads GWTW afterwards.",
            "I started out reading Gone with the Wind last year, and I thought it was the most awful chore of a read ever. However, as soon as I hit page 400, it got really interesting. And when I was done, I had to admit that I loved it. It was the first (and only book besides Scarlett and The Exorcist) that made me cry. All I have to say is that, anyone who hates this book must either be dead or just moronic.",
            "This book was so good my friends are all reading it! I told every one of my friends about it, that's how good it was! It took me 4 days to read it, because i stayed up all night long just to finish it. The passion in this book made my spine tingle, and my heart beat faster than it has in a while! Anyone who reads it will find it one of the best books you'll ever find.",
            "... Millions of people not only remember Gone with the Wind, but re-read it faithfully. Literary critics and scholars don't like this book and wish it would go away. The reason? They can't quite account for its enduring popularity. It's sentimental. It doesn't break new literary ground. It's racist. Blah, blah, blah. And yet. How many other works of so-called \"popular fiction\" from the '30s and '40s are remembered, let alone read, today? None. How many are even in print? None. The hub-bub surrounding Alice Randall's satirical follow-up last year had less to do with that novel's merits than the near mythical status Gone with the Wind has achieved in American culture. Why? Because Mitchell tells a helluva story. Unforgettable and complex characters, an involving plot and a timeless theme: survival. The pacing, structure and language run circles around most books published today, yes, even those with literary aspirations. All this and heroine who dares not to be liked. Come to think of it, maybe Mitchell did break new ground. Pick it up. You won't be able to put it down.",
            "I expected this book to be just a dramatic love story but it is so much more than that.I fell in love with Rhett, expierianced all the pain scarlett went through,cried when Melly died and laughed over and over again at Rhett and scarlett's witty repartee.To me this means this is a great book and to anybody that will listen I would tell you that, to not read it would mean that you are really missing out on a wonderful expierience.",
            "This is a great book, I borrowed it from the library twice and then decided to just go ahead and buy it. I bought the paperback version, which is great to read, but my only problem was it falls apart. After reading through about 2 chapters, and only one week of owning the book, the paper had separated from the back. I definitely would recommend the book, only get the hardback one.",
            "It isn't all about the romance. Let me just blurt this out: Rhett is the HOTTEST MAN and after reading this you will be disappointed in every man you meet! He makes my blood boil like mad! He drives me mad! God, he's so damn sexy. He truly knows a woman and what she wants, and definitely what I want. I suggest that every man read in detail of Rhett's kissing technique because we need more men with skills like those. But enough of my gushing. Gosh, I wish I could have met this gifted writer who has combined multiple themes, tones, characters, and ideas and weaved it into this novel. I am not kidding nor exaggerating when I say this is the best novel, was always the best novel, and will always be the best novel. I've never laughed so hard or sobbed so much for a book. Everything fits right into place. THis is a perfect symphony on which the description of setting flow so well into the characters. I love the clever remarks of Rhett. Yes, he's VERY clever, as well as sexy. However, this is NOT a trashy romance novel. Margaret Mitchell does not give the usual and cliched damsel in distress heroine. Many intelligent and not-so-intelligent people have complained that of supposed rape, the inaccuracy of slaves were actually treated by their owners, and other indecencies. The one about rape is a flimsy complaint that can be easily refuted because it wasn't and the description of the scene fully suggests otherwise. However, the latter complaint has more value. However, if you really want to see the truth of the treatment of black slaves, just pick up Howard Zinn's A People's History of the United States for such purposes. I am glad that the heroine was an imperfect hero. She was as real as any human. Scarlett is the person name for her because it certainly reflects her red-hot devotion to her beloved home Tara and her parents. Other characters such as Melanie and Ashley were so excellently developed. The characters can't get any closer to reality. However, I have lost many nights of sleep for reading this. This is so addictive that I could give up sleep for days in a row.",
            "Gone With the Wind is a great book about a young woman named Scarlett O'Hara who is selfish and cares only about herself as she struggles to keep herself alive during the Civil War. If you enjoy reading stories during the Civil War, this is the book for you.",
            "I liked this book because it was fun to read but I did not like the way Scarlet actted.",

            "\"Gone With the Wind\", taken as pure fiction, stands as an interesting and well-written tale of life in the Old South. Characters are well developed and constant in their portrayal of the complexities of love and life under the strain of a collapsing civilization. Survival amidst tremendous hardships and the source of strength in the human soul are topics that the novel/movie address nicely. However, taken in a context of reality, \"Gone With the Wind\" is insulting to the reader's/viewer's intelligence and to the ancestors of Southerners, both black and white, free and slave, through its completely one-sided depiction of life in the plantation south. Many other reviewers on this site have commented that \"Gone With the Wind\" is a nice change from other books and movies in that it portrays the master/slave relationship as being affable. The truth, however, is not so pleasant. It is evident from the reading of historical documents that even the kindest of slaveholders did not keep their slaves as well-clothed, well-fed, and lightly worked as the O'Haras kept theirs. Only once did the movie portray slaves doing field labor. It never showed the slaves' living quarters, which were often less than comfortable. The only brutality and punishment it showed was when Scarlet hit Prissy for not moving fast enough when Melanie was giving birth. The representation of Mammy is partly accurate in that she was a jack-of-all-trades woman who cared especially for the master's children. The other side of the \"Mammy\" role however, was that on most plantations, the mammy was overworked, on-call 24 hours a day, and abused sexually and physically by the master. Also, a mammy would have never had the authority to boss around a master's daughter like Mammy bossed around Scarlet. For those who desire a well-written piece of fiction that takes place in a beautiful and gentile fantasy world called the Old South, I would surely recommend \"Gone With the Wind\". For those who know better than to believe in illusions of peace and warmth in the plantation south and who enjoy books that have at least one foot in the doorway of reality, \"Gone With the Wind\" will not be on your list of favorites.",
            "Nice story, feels a little like a soap opera at times, but the civil war part of the story is excellent. Could have and should have been shorter...lots of filler.Overall it is pretty good read.",
            "This is one of those books where you find a little bit of yourself in each character, rather than finding one you can entirely associate with. It's imposible to completely like or completely hate any of the characters.There are many reasons I can't bring myself to read any of the liscenced or unofficial sequels to this book:1)This book was written about 73 years after the time setting of the book itself, & when the author was born in 1700, Having read books from that time, like Baum's Oz series, culture of the late 19tch century & early 20th century were more similar than the 1900s are from now, so she wouldn't have had to do nearly as much research on life in the Confederate South as a sequel writer would, & a sequal writer younger than herself would have their cultural views skewed by the changes of modern times.2)It doesn't really need a sequel. If you think about what direction the story might have gone in if Rhett didn't leave Scarlet; They were incapable of being happy together it might have had the same kind of tragic ending as Warren Adler's \"War of the Roses.\" Or since Scarlet is such a proud woman who has been married to many men she didn't love, she might return from Tara & decide to divorce Rhett upon his promised occasional returns & marry the childish Ashley just to kick Rhett in the side for abandoning her. Or she could have gone another 5 or 10 years persuing Rhett only to loose interest in him when she finally won him back; like she looses interest in anything else when the hunt is over.I recommend \"War of the Roses,\" as well as Jane Austin's \"Pride & Prejudice,\" as I find similarity in their rough relationship as well.",
            "I think that Gone with the wind is the best book ever written the movie is a winner to . I love how it informs you of everything that is going on. You go through the whole book like will Scarlett and Redett get together or will they stay together will Scarlett finally get Ashely. Will they survive the war. Who will live and who will die. You read through the tragides and the good times . I give Gone with the Wind and will argue with anyone who differs.",
            "Thinking of this book, it's hard to avoid a real feeling of sadness. Unfortunately, many people know NOTHING about post- Civil War Reconstruction besides what they read in GWTW and saw in the 1939 movie. Everything from both sources that relates to the Reconstruction era is wrong-- and yes, I do mean EVERYTHING. America reached a peak of racial harmony in those years that in many ways it has yet to reattain. It was an era of honest, integrated government, integrated education, integrated workplaces, and so much more. Many, many white people, including Southerners and former Confederates, were able to lay their racism aside to an astonishing degree and attempt to rebuild a new South. It was a shining, extraordinary period of our nation's history. Too bad few people know anything accurate about it, and instead get totally incorrect information from sources like GWTW!",
            "The cover of this book appealed to me more than the classic, hardback and so I purchased it instead just a few weeks ago. The book arrived on time and everything appeared to be in perfect condition. However, the old adage, \"You can't judge a book by it's cover\" must be very true, indeed, considering that at least two pages are missing and that one is replaced with a later page.With that aside, being that I am an avid reader, I'm almost ashamed to admit that I have not read this book until recently and fortunately, I wasn't succumbed to it despite all of the cult-like adoration it receives. Besides Margret Mitchell's writing being possibly the best I think I've ever come across; passionate descriptions, believable characters and dialogue, etc.,GWTW is filled with anti-equality, anti-Republican, hate speech that is impossible to ignore, and the book could have easily been shortened by at least 300 pages. Though Mitchell's writing style was obviously brilliant, she tended to delve too far into trivial details concerning things that were utterly pointless in my opinion.I agree wholeheartedly with another reviewer that Ms. Mitchell would possibly have an extremely difficult time getting her book published today.",
            "I love this book, I've read about 6 or 7 times at least. It's fun reading about someone more: clueless, and selfish than me.",
            "First of all: I adored the movie. I fell in love with Gable and with Leigh at the same time. Everyone could see that they were made for each other. I mainly expected a romantic love story when I started to read the novel. Yet it was nowhere to be found though a lot of reviewers seem to have seen what I obviously could not see.The first shock was that Scarlett is apparently only sixteen when she first meets Rhett, aged thirty-three, an already middle-aged, sophisticated man who chases after an incredibly shallow and vain teenager with much more gumption than wit. Scarlett is so emotionally immature and ignorant that it borders on blatant stupidity. I usually love it when the heroes indulge in verbal duels but those in this book I could not enjoy for Scarlett always looks foolish in them. To make it worse she is as cold as a fish, extremely childish and calculating. The authoress referred to her charm, intelligence and allure more than once but I couldn't see any of it except her beauty of course and that she was hard to get. She could be Becky Sharp's little sister but at least Thackeray's lady possessed intellect, a good judgment for people and a great sense of humor. To be fair I have to say that the heroine is resilient and smart when it comes to business. She also isn't afraid of hard work though exactly those only likeable traits make her suspicious to the good people of Atlanta. Yet Rhett was hardly a Harlequin hero either. Unlike his movie character he is bitingly sarcastic and acidly derisive instead of charming, amusing and witty. I found him considerably more sinister than Gable. He is violent, unreliable and really ruthless in a menacing way. With very good reason men usually don't like him. The way he is portrayed I couldn't like him either. I had no clue if Rhett loved Scarlett or not and if he did, why? Her reactions remained equally enigmatic in the novel. The book was surely a fascinating read for a lot of reasons but it made me unhappy in an unpleasant way. The characters often treat each other in such a hateful and cruel way that it was painful to watch. Whatever kind of love those two felt for each other, tenderness and true concern for the other seemed to have been no part in it. For fans of true romance I cannot recommend this book.",
            "Yes, it is a magnificent novel, an American classic. Filled with larger than life characters Gone with the Wind takes the reader to a chapter of American history not readily remembered (Southern Reconstruction) and to institutions we wish we could not remember (slavery, racism and the KKK).Lets talk about the novel. It is not a book for the faint of heart- my edition is over 700 pages. Yet, Margaret Mitchell has the gift to immerse you in a world that has long since passed. From the comfort of our armchairs it is difficult for us to imagine the sense of lostness the southern gentry must of felt during and after the war. They simply lost everything. Yet, there is something about the American character that does not want to give up, a stubbornness best personified by Scarlet O'Hara.I first read Gone with The Wind in the early 90's, it left an indelible imprint on my mind. About a year ago as I was persuing my library, it caught my eye again. I pull it for the self, sat down in my wing back chair and began reading eagerly anticipating being drawn into Mitchell's south once again. This time, however, I could not finish the book. A few hundred pages into it, I gently closed the cover and put it back into my library. What was it that caused me not complete this book? It was the blatant racism that seemed to permeate every other page.Yes, I realize that this book was written by a southerner reflecting a time and culture long since gone. Yes, racism is an appropriate subject to write about. Yes, one may write a novel that reflect the racism of the antebellum south- but this is one country preacher who will not read it again.",
            "Really, that's my only gripe. Too many pages and all that dialogue and long paragraphs with Mammy and Prissy and all the others talking so strangely. I blame it on Margaret Mitchell!But despite the length (1,037 pages) and overbearing dialogue, I found the book to be very enjoyable. It took me a whole year to read this damn thing, but at least I finally finished! And I am not going to read SCARLETT or THE WIND DONE GONE!Anyways, I loved the movie especially! Vivien Leigh is hot and gorgeous! Gable is Gable, classy and smug! I have the tape at home as part of my Best Picture collection. The movie is also long, at nearly 4 hours! But in the end, Mitchell did a good job. Alice Randall and Alexandra Ripley should be ashamed of themselves for thinking they could do better! HA!Pretty good reading, as long as nothing interferes with it. I found myself putting the damn thing away and leaving it for months on end. Thanks to my job with those bastards at the UF Foundation, I got a chance to get through it!I am the man!",
            "I've been thinking for a long time that I should read this book--and I'm probably not alone. It's not like I don't know the plot, but still, I've always imagined that it's a classic piece of American storytelling. Let's just say that the writing can be hackneyed, and at times cringe-worthy. But what will make this book last is Mitchell's ability to tell a story, to make people want to turn the page, and experience what happens next. This skill is often undervalued and overlooked, but makes her talent stand above the abilities of others who can write a better sentence. I would recommend this book, not as a timeless piece of literature, but of storytelling.",
            "This was a gift for a family member. They loved it very much. Thank you for putting it on paperback.",
            "It's an ok story until after the war and then how they turn on the poor old masters and blah, blah, blah... pure southern womanhood all a-fearin' them free black men going around crazy raping... oh come on Margaret, where did you do your research?Just too much of it... and I'm not really so sure Scarlet is so bad, she seems the only one capable of doing the work it takes to get the whole family out of all the scrapes they are in... so what's wrong with that???Well, must consider when it was written I suppose... next I'm reading &#34;Uncle Tom's Cabin&#34; to get the bad taste out of my mouth.",

            "Just finished this story. Took a while. Glad I didn't live in that period. Now I know what all that dreadful war was about. I didn't know anything about it but now I am full up to the top! I have not read anything quite like this novel which took me weeks to read, and I thank my lucky stars I am me, living in a tiny country where people don't go mad. The sheer volume of words describing conflict, emotions, deprivation and loss was unbelievable. If you want to tuck up on a rainy day (or days) and learn what it was like to live in that century then this is the book for you. Scarlett needed a good smack, Rhett needed a good hug, Pittypat needed a box of tissues, Ashley needed a ramrod for his spine and Melly needed a sainthood. Yes, I understood what was written about the war, and loathed it, but isn't that what a story is supposed to do? Wring out your feelings? And I certainly am wrung out. This book gives you more buck for your dollar than many I have read, so go on - put your feet up and get stuck in to Gone with the Wind. Makes you feel grateful for what you have.",
            "after my dog ate my moms copy I never thought I'd get another one just like it! Thanks!",
            "I was reluctant to read Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind because I thought it was basically a romance novel. It is not. It includes some very appealing characters and lots of action.The focus of the novel is on Scarlett O'Hara. She is a magnificent creature, beautiful and strong, but she is completely defined by her selfishness. When she is a fresh young woman, her selfishness is actually appealing - at least to Rhett Butler, a rogue who appreciates anyone who flaunts conventional morality. As time passes, though, Rhett matures and Scarlett does not, and her selfishness has more serious consequences.The plot moves quickly through a series of exciting episodes: battles are won or lost, men and women fall in love, babies are born and soldiers die. The author maintains suspense as we await the defeat of the Confederacy but of course the result is never in doubt. At the end of the war, genteel Southern society collapses and is replaced by coarse commercialism and opportunism. The aristocracy is ruined and its members are forced into trades. Against this backdrop, we watch the romance between Scarlett and Rhett Butler develop and then wane.Mitchell depicts the antebellum South as a happy society with a place for everyone, from the planter aristocracy down to the slaves who thrive under their paternalistic care. This depiction is affecting but obviously idealized. Many subsequent passages of the book, dealing with racial relations during the reconstruction, are even more offensive to African-Americans. Mitchell wrote Gone with the Wind 70 years ago and her views on race are not modern ones. Still, there is no denying her ability as a writer, and there is no denying that Gone with the Wind is a great novel.",
            "\"Gone with the Wind\" by Margaret Mitchell is one of my favorite books of all time. Scarlet O'Hara, the foolish southern belle is in love with Ashley Wilkes, a scholar who won't have anything to do with her. To rebel, she marries his fianc&eacute;e' s brother and when the war breaks out, it turns ugly. She is then forced to move to Atlanta to her husband's house. In Atlanta, Georgia during the Civil War things aren't easy. It is hot and sandy. The sticky humidity is horrible to live in yet the feeling of \"home\" is evident everywhere. There are always barbecues and lazy afternoons up till the war. The south is mostly cotton fields, with little factories while the north is full of manufacturing. Things don't look too good for the south when the war breaks out and to make everything worse, the ports are soon closed off. All too soon Scarlet feels the bitterness of war as her childhood friends die for a losing cause. When she finds Atlanta being attacked by General Sherman she must flee for safety and there is nowhere to go.This story is about a girl who has been spoiled her entire life and then must learn to do things on her own. She faces the fact that she can't have everything and that she has to make sacrifices. Her whole life she has been the brat that depends on everyone else so she can't do anything on her own. She is blinded by her own insolence to the truth that nothing is fair. Sweet Melanie, her sister in law is kind to her and is too sweet hearted to see the wrong in anyone; she doesn't see how corrupt Scarlet' s mind is. She is always on Scarlet' s side despite the horrible things that she does. Scandalous Rhett Butler loves Scarlet for her foul heart and chases her throughout the whole book. Rhett has a history for doing unthinkable things to girls. (Unthinkable at the time; refusing to marry a girl he courted, publicly kissing, etc.) Everyone despises him for making a profit off of the war. All proper people support the failing cause and Rhett makes fun of them. He is a businessman, so nothing is personal till he meets Scarlet. As time progresses, Scarlet comes to realize the damage that she has done with her being wicked to everyone. She literally is and was a spoiled brat. Her suffering teaches her a lesson that we all should learn.If you love historical fiction with a little romance, this book is perfect for you. Scarlet is the perfect Southern belle who is incredible to read about. How she attracts men with her charm and little helpless acts is unbelievable. She is used to having slaves serve her and she treats them with little or no respect until she needs them. You cannot stop thinking about how much you would hate Scarlet if she was real, but you can't stop feeling sorry for her and you want to help her to realize how stupid she is.In this book you have a look at how the south was before and after the Civil War. They were still people with feelings, not horrible people who were wicked. You fall in love with the chivalry and way of life. You also realize how wrong slavery was. Even they knew it was wrong, they just couldn't imagine life without the slave labor. I think that the book is written well, you see why people did things and the reasoning behind their actions. I didn't always agree with what Scarlet did, but I knew why she did things. The book is very interesting and I couldn't put it down at all. I certainly would recommend it to just about anyone. I certainly understand the era better now. The book got me interested in other books about the war and now I can see why people felt the way they did. I can see the good and bad in slavery. I feel that lack of education on the issue is what caused such disastrous effects.",
            "Introduction: This classic novel is full of famous statements like `Tomorrow is an other day.' It is also made into a film, which had won 9 Oscar Academy Awards based on this story.Summary: This story is set in the American Civil War. Scarlet O'Hara is a pretty but proud young lady. She is living in the south of America. Gentlemen love her. But the prince in Scarlet heart is Ashley. Ashley is a bookworm. Although Scarlet loves him, he has chosen his cousin to be his wife. Scarlet is so angry and marry a man she doesn't love. But then the war breaks out. Scarlet's husband dies. The land south of America is losing from land north of America. She then finally finds her true love. Rhett Buttler, Scarlet's third husband has a wonderful time with her until Rhett finds a great secret about Scarlet...Opinion: I think that this story is absolutely wonderful. When you are reading the book, the character's personality will attract you. But I don't really like Scarlet. Although she is beautiful, she is vain and mean. It has a very good storyline. It makes you continue reading page after page. This book teaches us a lot of lessons. And it also tells us how bad, cruel war is. I think this is the greatest love story ever.Audience: This book is good for age 13 or above. It is good for everyone. But I'm afraid that the complicated story will confuse younger readers. J",
            "I read this when I was in 5th grade, and I fell in love with it! Scarlett is one of the most interesting, fun-to-read-about characters ever, and you're pretty much transported to the world of the antebellum American South.There's a reason this book has such enduring popularity!",
            "Gone With the Wind is an amazing book that leaves you a changed person.Treasure, treasure, treasure your first time read because the impact of this book is so deep you'll be left in a trance for days. Whilst reading this novel you will eat, sleep, breathe Gone With the Wind - so place any important activities on hold and don't read if there is any exams ahead!The first time you read it is a feeling that will be in your heart forever!!! A magical journey that grips your senses and rips at your heart, but devestatingly,can only be travelled once. But don't worry, although you can never really grasp those same feeling ever again, the book will still have you hooked everytime you read it. You will still hope and wish that Scarlett will find true happiness, even if such dreams are futile. I've read it on average once a year since that first awesome time and it neevr ceases to hook me in.The characters are all well-developed, particularly Scarlett (the main character). The reader is given a great insight and undestanding of Scarlett which is why she rightfully claims her spot in history. She is quite simply unforgettable. An amazing character who stands the test of time and, in my mind, has become a memory of a real person.Reader's should not look to this book for the rights and wrongs of slavery or deep insights of the civil war. This is a romance novel that Mitchell has intwined beautifully with minor war details and a subtle look into the pre-war South.There is a reason why this is one of the most well-known and purchased book of all time. Read it and you will find out. But be warned, the ending will break your heart and it will be as painful as any real-life romance. Hard to believe I know, but the characters so amazing that they stay with you 24 hours a day whislt reading and you feel their emotions like you are them. Margaret Mitchell was a very talented lady.",
            "The last book that I finished was Gone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell. It is set during the Civil War in the South, specifically in Atlanta. It is the story of Scarlett O'Hara and how her life changes during the Civil War and early Reconstruction. She is selfish and vain and will do about anything to rebuild her life after the North wins the war. She is left very poor and has to provide for the survivors of her family. She will do anything to make some money, even marry several times to people that she doesn't care for while the real \"love\" of her life is married to her sister-in-law. Scarlett just wants to have enough money to once again become the belle of the county.One character that she meets on this journey that I particularly enjoyed was Rhett Butler. Rhett is a charming, opinionated man with money that sees Scarlett how she really is and tells people the truth, however harsh that it is.I liked this book because it is about the Civil War, but through the eyes of a vain young woman whose life drastically changes. If you like historical fiction with a romantic twist, you will probably enjoy this classic tale of love between two interesting personalities.",
            "Hey, 'Reader from Santa Fe'. Yes there are passages which are cringeworthy. And do you know what? Thank God it's never been banned! For MM to have written it any other way would be a fib. No, I'm not talking about the glorification of slavery and their 'barracks.' I am with you and Toni Morrison 100% on the reality of this outrageous part of history. But for MM to have written it any other way would hardly ring true. Anyone who knows about her life knows that she was writing from the perspective that she did because that was her experience. She lived in a world of white supremacy and segregation, and do you know what? I read this and think thank goodness we don't now! Thak goodness I can have the friends that I want to and date the guys I want to, regardless of their background. GWTW is as much a historical document, albeit laced with southern pride, inasmuch as it shows what past attitudes were. I see GWTW as a great story nonetheless, with strong characters clashing with each other and riding roughshod over others in the name of self-survival. Not always attractive qualities, but qualities that have themselves survived. May I recommend The Wind Done Gone by Alice Randall? She writes that MM and GWTW inspired her to think. They inspired me too.",
            "After I read the Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood (by Rebecca Wells), I really wanted to read Gone with the Wind. In Sisterhood, Wells characters actually attend the premier of the movie. I have seen the movie, Gone with the Wind, several times, but, as usual, the book is much better. I really enjoyed the &quot;love story&quot; about Scarlett and Rhett. I wish Mitchell had written the sequel, which I have not read. She did an excellent job with the characters and I amnot sure if anyone could do it better. The story is true to life. Scarlett seemed to think the grass was greener on the otherside and that money/material things is the answer to everything. Not always true. Scarlett failed to see what she had in Rhett, until she lost him. Something to think about. I really hated to see this book end.",
            "The book &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; by Margaret Mitchell is my favorite book ever. Since I was only in sixth grade when I read it, even I found it a great book. Both the movie and the book have been American standards for literature. There are dozens of memorable characters, with plenty of juicy parts to hold it together. Even though it is 1,024 pages, it is very hard to put down. I read it over three months, about 20 pages a day, and I had to limit myself! This is surely the greatest book ever written. However, if you are the movie type, do not let me limit you. See the Academy Award winning move &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; with Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable give thier performance of thier career! Filled with lots of exciting characters, events, scenery, and detail; all of this is needed to create the best piece of American Literature, and &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; by Margaret Mitchell has it all.",
            "Ever since reading Gone with the wind in sixth grade, it has been my favorite book! It is fun and easy to read. Margret Michell knew how to perfectly balance a story with seriousness and pure comic relief. The story takes place during a rough time in the South, The American Civil War. Scarlet is devoted to the Cofederate cause, or at least at sometimes she seems to be. At other times she appears to be more devoted to herself. Rhett Butler, the other main character could care less about the outcome of the war, as long as he is benefiting from the finanical booms it results in. Both the characters are so equally stubborn making them perfect for eachother, but neither of them can see this until it may be too late.",
            "Oh, crackle. The times are too and the heat is. This takes 100 pages for ANYTHING to happen. That's genius. I'd a never have the guts to do that until now. Know me and use me. I'm made of torhudidite an' if ya got a problem with it, wear protection you wussle. I see the picture and they kick. I see the ad on an ad and the dolphin lost a friend. Take that.",
            "Hell, I just wasted the better part of my Sunday reading the last couple of hundred pages of this trash, always in the hope that somewhere, there had to be this twist which would make the book worth reading, but it just never came. I ended flinging the book across the room, disgusted. Character, heroism, intelligence, thoughtfulness? Things Scarlett certainly lacks can all be found in books like Inception (Harbinson) or even better: A Town like Alice (Shute). Please don't waste your time as I did....",
            "My father browbeat me into reading \"Gone With The Wind\" when I was a teenager. To this day I can't understand what all the fuss was about. Scarlet is such a spoilt snit that I couldn't care what happened to her. I guess this is one book you either love or hate, so I recommend that you check a volume out of the library and read a chapter or two. If you hate it, you've lost nothing but a little of your time. If you love it, well, there's no accounting for taste.",
            "Written during the Great Depression when Americans needed escapism, GWTW and the resulting movie it spawned are primarily responsible for distorting many Americans impressions of slavery, as well as trivializing the horror of the Civil War. If you like your history covered with moonlight and magnolias and sugar-coated beyond all reality GWTW is just what you are looking for. After all, its only fiction. Problem is, too many people over the years have come to regard it as almost gospel. In the end, GWTW is little more than a cheap attempt to create an American version of Tolstoy's &quot;War &amp; Peace.&quot;",
            "There is so much lip service paid to how good this book is, and how everyone should read it, and yadda yadda yadda.The prose is boring, way too purple and prosaic. It makes Soap Operas look realistic.None of this speaks to the fact that the whole book is RASCIST. The south was built on the backs of African-Americans, and they died to build the South up. They are still fighting for equality, and now we have some romantic idealization of the South, and Margaret Mitchell makes the Klan look like some good group of good ol' boys.I am disgusted that a book this blatently racist and snotty is still held up as a classic.",
            "I use to feel bad about Sherman burning Atlanta, but that was before I read this book. Though it is a very well written book it is very offensive to; African Americans, women and of course Yankees.",

            "IT WAS TERRIBLE! I hated Gone with the wind, at no time did it get my attention at all! I had all I could do to finish the book!",
            "I have just re-read GWTW for the fourth time and each timeI do I start out thinking it a magnificently written and researched book, with a glorious story - and the patronizing racist attitude of the author - yes, the author herself - makes me sick to my stomach.I devoured this novel when I was thirteen, again in my twenties, then my thirties, and here I am again, keen to know what will happen next to that sociopath Scarlett O'Hara the ultimate sexy, manly man, Rhett Butler and the dreamy dreamer and weakling, Ashley Wilkes.And yet - I believe this book should be banned. There are almost no books I feel that way about. I'm a writer and I abhor censorship. But this book is so outright racist it gags.Why should such stereotypes be allowed to continue for generation after generation to absorb?What would the world think of a romantic novel about dashing German SS officers and a beautiful blonde \"maidchen\" cavorting charmingly before concentration camp slaves? All the while talking about those slaves as if they were simply \"children\" who didn't know any better than to be wearing striped pajamas, carrying out humiliating tasks for their \"masters\" and existing pleasantly and contentedly in their cute little \"barracks\"? Critics would be up in arms. Such a novel would fall into disrepute and no one would claim it to be a great work of literature, even if it was well-written. So why do we stand for GWTW - this travesty of lies, lies, lies?I notice that one of the reviewers below mentioned that slaves weren't, in fact, badly treated. Hello! To begin with, slavery is slavery: an abomination upon the Earth. Any person who is enslaved is being treated badly. Period. Second, that reviewer should read Toni Morrison's \"Beloved\"to find out what it was REALLY like to live as a slave on a southern plantation. That depiction rings true. GWTW, on the subject of slavery, is complete clap-trap.Over and over again, it is mentioned that Scarlett's mother, \"Miss Ellen,\" would be \"turning over in her grave\" to see howScarlett betrayed her southern belle roots. Well, I contend that Margaret Mitchell is turning over in her grave because she knows what a monstrous mistake she made with GWTW. Hopefully, she's evolved, and, knowing her feminist views and her basic fairness as a person, I think she would agree with me - BAN THIS BOOK!",
            "For $10 you'd think there would be a working table of contents. Also don't forget the slaves depicted were from the masters' points of view.",
            "I was very happy with this copy of the the book. I loved the price (broke college student) and was pleased with the quality. I can't wait to start reading it!",
            "I purchased Gone With the Wind for my Kindle. It was a great read and I am happy to have it in my Kindle library!",
            "I placed an order for a new one, but got a used one with several markers and dirty. So, I am so disappointed with this book.",
            "My old paperback copy of \"Gone With The Wind\" was falling apart and so I decided to download it onto my Kindle. What a pleasure to read it again in this format! Readers who are curious about the author Margaret Mitchell might be interested in reading her biography \"Road to Tara\" by Anne Edwards.",
            "Margaret Mitchell's \"Gone with the Wind\" is a mesmerizing novel. I saw the movie when I was young and disliked it immensely. Therefore, I never read the book until it was selected for a book club. With some trepidation, I began reading and was immediately plunged into a riveting tale.This epic concerns the headstrong Scarlett O'Hara, a southern belle who becomes embroiled in the Civil War and Reconstruction Era. It is a story of Scarlett's selfishness and also her courage. The story revolves around the tumultuous relationship that develops between Scarlett and Rhett Butler, an enigmatic, harsh, and pitiable man who recognizes within Scarlett a likeness to himself. However, Scarlett's unrequited love for a gentler man, Ashly Wilkes, proves to be astumbling block to her happiness. Her unrelenting quest to obtain money also causes her to make many enemies. Scarlett symbolizes the changing times, and she and Rhett are a perfect match. Ashley represents the \"old ways,\" and thus this story can be seen as a symbolic journey. Times change, and people must adapt in order to survive. Although I do not necessarily agree with \"survival of the fittest\" mentality, the theme is addressed very poignantly in this story. I was repulsed by Scarletts ruthlessness, yet I also admired her courage and strength. Rhett was heartbreaking as he seemed to be ravaged by his own anger. He was a man who was desperate for love as are we all. Rhett seems to symbolize our own hungry souls. He is strong in some ways yet startlingly weak in others. He reminded me a little of the character Heathcliff in Emily Bronte's \"Wuthering Heights\".My only complaint of the book is the treatment of black individuals. Many people have written on this subject, so I will not do so here. I did like Mammy's character even though she was stereotypical.Mitchell's characterization is superb. My favorite character is Melanie Wilkes. She is portrayed as a gentle yet strong woman. Melanie is courageous in her own way, and I loved her bravery in standing up against others who criticized those she loved. I also felt empathy as well as repugnance for both Scarlett and Rhett. All the characters are memorable, and Mitchell paints a vivid picture of struggle, disstruction, and triumph as the people within the story fight against the ravages of war.This book will stay with you long after you read it. Please give this wonderful story a chance. I'll definitely watch the movie again. I think I'll have a better appreciation for the film. God bless you all.",
            "I've been a fan of the story since I first saw Gone with the Wind when I was a little girl. I didn't even know it was based on a book until all the media attention that the sequel Scarlett got when I was in junior high. I immediately went to the library and checked out Gone with the Wind. Even though I loved the movie I loved the book so much more. There are so many details that have been left out. Since then I've read a lot of other historical fiction but this one is still my favorite. There's a good reason why this is such a popular classic novel.",
            "After seeing the movie many, many, MANY timea, I finally decided I MUST read this book. This is my selection for our book club. I could hardly put the book down. The movie was wonderful, but the book is FANTASTIC! Love it, love it, love it. We will be discussing this selection in our book club in early February and I know each of our members are thoroughly enjoying this read!",
            "This was my third time reading this book, each time in a different age period and each time with different experience and reflection on the story and characters of this wonderfully lavish and complex drama. yes I agree that the story is biased and somewhat racist. However, it reflects the attitudes of the general culture and way of life that existed back then in 1800s during and post Civil War. Put that aside (or rather become familiar with that specific culture), the story is heartbreaking, informative, and really addictive. I mean I would definitely recommend that before starting this book, clear your schedule for a week or two because once you start it is hard to put it down until you have reached the last page! You just get drawn into the this very well written story and you fall in love with all characters that are portraited with all of their complexities, strenghts, weaknesses, and yes lots and lots of mistakes and misunderstandings! So much that it breaks your heart over and over again and you can't help but to shake you head or even swear at them!",
            "Gone With the Wind was recieved exactly when described and in the condition as advertised. GREAT book by the way.",
            "I first read Gone With the Wind when I was 16 which was more than 50 years ago if you must know. I have always loved the book and the movie. I was in the hospital for a while last year and knew that I would have a lengthy recovery after I got home, so I bought this edition for my Kindle and read a chapter or two every night and it really helped to know it was there at the end of my day. I read it leisurely and loved it once again.I know there are several versions, or editions, for the Kindle, and I don't know about the others, but this one was recommended and it was perfect.",
            "This book is magical. It is enthralling and hard to peel your eyes away from. It is a delight to read and when you pull yourself away your mind is still in the old South. I found myself often dazed when I wasn't reading it. It is time consuming. Though this book is fantastic I both loved and hated the ending. It just didn't feel right. Like it wasn't finished and it desperatley needed a sequal. It would have been wonderful if Margaret Mitchell had written the sequal but she didn't so A. Ripley gave it her best shot. Although she is critizised for it I thought is was good as I don't believe GWTW is finished without the most famous characters of all time; Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler, together and in love.",
            "Margaret Mitchell's timeless classic, Gone With the Wind, is a book about young, Scarlett O'hara, who is madly in love with another woman's husband. She struggles through the hardships of the Civil War, supporting herself and her family. Her story is one of the strongest I have ever read. I recommend this book to everyone-it has just the right amount of romance, sadness, and truth in it to make it one of the greatest books.",
            "This book is absolutely fantastic. I am 14 years old and believe me at the beginnning I absolutely loathed my best friend when she tried to convince me to read this book. She was so persuasive that I finally relented.....and I dont regret it one bit. THis book was so captivating that I found it so hard to put it down. Margaret Mitchell has indeed done a fantastic job. Her descriptions are excellent and the conversations are well written indeed. This book is definitely a must read for all those who love Classical novels for it is unique and quite unbeatable.",
            "Gone With the Wind is a great book about a young woman named Scarlett O'Hara who is selfish and cares only about herself as she struggles to keep herself alive during the Civil War. If you enjoy reading stories during the Civil War, this is the book for you.",
            "Gone with the wind is definately my favorite book of all time. Margaret Mitchell portrays Scarlett and Rhett and everyone else with such detail that i felt i was watching it all happen. Every joy, every sorrow.... It is absolutely impossible to put down!!! My suggestion: read it on a weekend with nothing planned, and keep a box of tissues nearby. (can't wait to read the sequel, Scarlett)",
            "I've loved GWTW since I first saw it at the age of 12, but it wasn't until I was almost 30 before I read the book and boy was I surprised! Scarlett had more than one child! Margaret Mitchell wrote about characters other than those in the movie and once you read the novel, you'll wonder how Selznick was ever able to get the movie made. What a story. What an author. Read it and finally understand.",
            "This is the world's best book EVER! I have read hundreds of books, and not one rivaled this one! If you never read another book in your whole life, read this one. It is so amazing. You can't put it down. MM spins a web around you and you are trapped until the book is through. For two days after I read the book, I talked of nothing but the book (I am dead serious-ask my mom) Scarlett changed my life, she inspired me, she taught what to do- and what NOT to do. This book is the greatest.",
            "This book is the best book I have read in a long time.Although I first saw the movie, I was enchated with the book.Gone with the wind takes place around 1862, when the civil war strikes in The United States and tells the story and problems that Scarlett O'hara had to face.She is a spoiled and stubborn woman and that's why she never realizes the love she feels for Rhett Butler.Both of the main characters are stubborn persons,they love each other but in the same time they distrust their feelings.Rhett believed that Scarlett was in love with Ashley Wilkes and she believe he spent his time with another woman.Their distrust makes tem try to hurt each other in every way and they never get time to tell their feelings. The story is sad,romantic,historical and wonderfully written and the end surprises every one who read it.I completely loved this story and I recommended it to everyone who wants to read a true book.This classical novel will bring you to a world where you never imagined you could be when you read a book.There will never be a book such as.... GONE WITH THE WIND.",
            "Your initial reaction after seeing the movie is, &quot;How could this be any better than the movie?&quot;. But when you start in on the 1,000+ page epic. Your questions are answered in a few short paragraphs. Mitchell did her research and managed to produce on of the finest authoring efforts the history of American literature has ever seen. She managed to intertwine bits of her own life into the novel and provided her readers with a brilliant pallet of realistic characters. If there is any book that could make a reader weep, this is it. However, you have to keep warm while reading this to keep the goosebumps down.",
            "This is an amazing book. Suspensfull, and romantic, i was hooked by the first chapter. This classic story is the romantic tale of Scarlett O'Hara Hamilton Kennedy Butler, the strong, smart women of the civil war. The book tells the story of her growth as a person, her strength, her willfullness, and is an ongoing source of delight, tears, and endless romance. I recommened it to everyone and anyone. It is my very favorite book. Margaret Mitchell weaves a colorful and expressive masterpiece, and i am all praise! Read this book!",
            "When I saw this ~1000 page book, I got shocked. Actually my mother recommended me it. I really enjoyed every page. It is not the same as learning about U.S. Civil War in history. Everything was written so perfect that it was extremely hard to put the book down when the work awaited. I have never seen so strong characters as Scarlett and Rett had. I was so sad when the book was over, wanted it to last forever. I really love thick books if they are so great that this one. READ IT !!!",
            "I read &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; at the age of 12, and, even though it took me a long time to read, it is the best book I have ever read. Even now, two years later, I use examples and quotes form the book to use in everyday life. This book has something for everyone, romance, action, drama and comedy. Margaret Mitchell is brilliant in the way that she makes you sympathasize with the enemy. You never know what will happen next and it is impossible to put down!",
            "It never got boring. Every page was exciting. The character of Scarlet O'Hara is one that will be your favorite forever. All of her imperfections just make you love her more. It was one of those books that you wish wouldn't have ended, even though it is well over one thousand pages long. It is almost sad to think that no other book, in my mind, will ever live up to Gone With the Wind.",
            "No words can express the feelings this novel has evoked in millions of readers across the globe, and in myself, as well. It sings a song of such captivating music that it tears itself into the very epitome of one's soul; Gone with the Wind has moved me, touched me, held me. It sheds light on lessons more precious than gold or silver, more valuable than platinum. I could go on and on...but I'm sure you get my drift. Cry, weep, laugh, smile...whatever you do, don't be a fool...don't miss out on this one.",
            "I loved the book and I am currently reading 'Scarlett' to see if Scarlett does indeed get her man... I enjoyed reading all about the Civil War and the terrible effects it had on the Southern people. I thought Scarlett, Rhett and Mammy were fantastic characters - although I must admit I did, occassionally, feel like banging Scarlett and Rhett's heads together!! I couldn't stand Ashley - what a wuss!! I particularly liked Melanie, she seems like such a weak little goodie good two shoes but, in fact, she is actually a very strong, courageous woman and the truest friend you could ever have. A wonderful novel - I can see why it is a classic!!",
            "I first saw the movie, and I loved it, so I decided to read the book. I found that the book had so much more depth than the movie which I had already thought breath-taking. Scarlett is someone we can all relate to, yet hopefully not too closely. It is always difficult to stick with a book that is sooo long, but Gone with the Wind was one that wasn't a problem. I loved how Scarlett realized that she loved Rhett because I think that many people overlook their true loves for a lust object that would never make them happy. The book was amazing because it was so beautifully polished and taught many valuable life lessons. I would recommend it to anyone!",
            "Gone With the Wind is one of the best books ever written! It teaches a wonderful lesson. No matter what happens, there is going to be a tomarrow, and you shouldn't give up hope! Scarlett lost everything, but she was still strong and she still had hope. Margaret Mitchell is a wonderful writer. Scarlett and Rhett and her other timeless charactors are so real to me and to millions of people. Only a great book could have such an impact on America and the world that GWTW has!",
            "This is one of the best books I have ever read. If you don't enjoy it, there is something mentally wrong with you! (Just kidding-sort of) I can understand how it could be a challenging book, it IS over 1,000 pages long, however it's worth it. I knew a girl with a learning disability that caused her to read at a very slow rate, therefore giving her a genuine hatred of books. Someone gave her a copy of Gone with the Wind, and though she started it grudgingly, she couldn't put it down, and believe me, she read through that book faster then..well, (stick analogy here) it's a wonderful book! It gives you a true understanding of the south. That's the way it really was. Tara forever.",
            "This probabaly has to be the best book ever written. Mitchell did a great job on the plot, characters, everything! What she did the best on was the characters. Those were definetly three dimentional characters. When you are done you think that there is no way that this is fiction because Scarlett, Rhett, and everybody seem so real. You also come to like Scarlett because with all her faults, she is still a brave and strong character. Trust me, don't be intimadated by its size. It will probably be the best book you ever read.",
            "I love the movie Gone With the Wind, so I decided to read the book. I read the whole, 1,000-plus page book in a week! It's every bit as good, if not better. It is much better at explaining history and certain situatuions than the movie. (If you didn't understand the buisiness about the attack at Shantytown in the movei, read the book for a better understanding.) Margaret Mitchell also gives vivid, loving descriptions of the Old South, though I had to skim most of them so they wouldn't slow me down! She also gives vivid characterizations of all the main characters and quite a few more who weren't in the movie. The story is very enthralling and never boring. I definitly recommend it.",
            "Margaret Mitchell's epic novel &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; defies all ratings. It deserves far more than a mere ten. I read this book when I was 13 years old, and discovered the most unforgettable story with the most vibrant, LIVING characters ever written. To me, Scarlett O'Hara, Rhett Butler, Melanie Wilkes, and all the others are truly real people. The movie &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; is undoubtedly the greatest film ever made, which it could hardly help being with such a story to work from. This book can and should be read by anyone who loves to read, because it is simply too good to miss.",
            "This book is possibly the greatest piece of literature I have ever set my eyes upon. Although it took me about two weeks to read it, I lived through a decade of history and watched as Scarlett O'Hara struggled against and won over every adversity in the midst of the Civil War. I felt as though I were right there watching as the drama played out before me. Never before have I had such a complete and accurate view of history and been fooled so completely into thinking that characters on the page were real people that actually lived. If one does not read this book, then it is a complete loss to him or her for they have passed up the chance to experience, rather than read, a book",
            "I could go on and on about how good the book is like everyone else does. I am not it is without a doubt the best novel ever. even if you do not like the Civil War the love story sweeps you for decades and decades to come",
            "GWTW has been my favorite book for a very long time. I just turned fourteen and I read it in fifth grade. For as long as I could remember, my sister had been talking about this book and how it had altered her opinion on classic literature. So, in fifth grade, i saw the movie, adored it got a hold of the book and read it to the very end. Even now, my parents remark about my &quot;Gone With the Wind Period&quot; when I thought of nothing but GWTW and read everything I could on the subject. I ordered cards, I got the script to the movie, I even read the biographys, letters and pictures of Margaret Mitchell. It's a awsome movie, a brilliant novel, and, to sum things up, probably the most influential book/movie of my childhood, it helped make me into the person I am today.---Cynthia Christina Vanci",
            "I am only twelve years old, and most people my age aren't at all interested in love stories. I am always interested in a good book, and most of my picks are action or mystery. I have read hundreds of books in my life so far, some of them poorly written, some of them average, but many of them incredible. These books have captured my imagination, but Gone With the Wind took my soul. I almost made a new lake out of my tears when Melanie died. And I loved Mammy! She added some of the funniest parts to a book I have ever had the honor to read. I am still wondering how she'll ever get Rhett back after what happened. I haven't read the sequal yet but I intend to do so. In fact, I am trying to order it from Amazon.com as soon as possible. I don't care if dozens of people didn't like the sequal. I HAVE GOT TO KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT IN THE STORY! That's also one of GWTW's strong points. Most people won't read more than the first chapter, but if you decide to go the extra mile (or two) you will find yourself dodging bullets in Sherman's seige of Atlanta. If there is one weakness to it, it's in the movie itself. It followed closely to the story line, but strangely the guys making it forgot about little Wade and Ella, and almost forgot Will entirely. But even worse, they got Mr. O'hara's death completely mixed up. And some of the guys that they got to play the beaux didn't know the first thing about acting. Charles Hamilton may have been an idiot, but surely he wasn't that dumb! Sorry, I'm getting to into the movie (I just finished watching it for the first time today). Still, despite the movie's sad mistakes, Gone With the Wind has swept this twelve year old boy off is feet and into the civil war in Atlanta! This isn't a rental book. This is a buying book",
            "Being raised in the south myself, I feel a kinship to Scarlett O'Hara. Margaret Mitchell's book has keep me captivated since I was a child. GWTW was one of the first book reports I gave in jr. high school. The teacher couldn't believe that someone of my age could have read such a book. Although it took close to a week to read it, GWTW has stayed in my mind and heart in all the years that have followed. No book has made the impression that this one has made on me. I don't believe there is one that could. The first copy of this book I ever got has long since had the ink rubbed from its pages. It was well worth the time that is takes to read it. It is TRULY a classic",
            "I have read this many times, and love it better every time. Rhett Butler was my first love ever, thanks to Margaret Mitchell. I still have a little crush on him. She made the characters so real that I feel like I grew up knowing them as my friends",
            "How do you rate a work of art? By the amount of people who have fallen under its spell? Or by the amount of hours one spends reading it, and then reviewing it? Gone with the wind has already been rated a ten, and its flame has not diminished an iota. I am fifteen, and I have yet to read a book which portrays civil war, and love, as well as Margaret Mitchell does in Gone with the Wind. I am fifteen, and I have yet to love a heroine as much as I love Scarlett O' Hara. Melanie is good, but Scarlett is alive! Her spirit and unflagging determination awakens in all of us the right to survive. We all need reminders of the horrors of war, and of the fact that while mostly the men go off to war, it is the woman who has to stay home and somehow make do with only the bare essentials of life, and hope...........................I recommend everyone to read this book, it is the best!",
            "Gone with the Wind was the fisrt 'adult' book I'd ever read as a child .Took me awhile to get thru it but I'v read it many times since then. It was MY daughters first 'adult' book and has become her favorite also. I hope that my grandaughter also loves this book when she comes to be",
            "Margaret Michell's GONE WITH THE WIND is a tragic saga that can never be forgotten once read. Scarlett O'Hara is headstrong, intelligent, bold, and beautiful but she also makes mistakes. She is selfish and lives for the present. Rett Buttler is one man no woman can ever forget. He is the perfect father and lover whom is first consumed wholly with Scarlett and then driven away by her. Scarlett's frivolousness will be turned over and over in your mind. If you want to read a truely absorbing, romantic, historically accurate book let this one be your first choice",
            "This awesome book takes the reader back to the 1800s and the Civil war era. Its main characters include Scarlett O'Hara Hamilton Kennedy Butler, from whose point of view the story is told, the charming and fickle Rhett Butler, Ashley Wilkes, the object of Scarlett's affection, and his wife, Melly. I say, if you read only one book in your life, this should be it!",
            "Margaret Mitchell's characters are very real and life like. Scarlett is never portrayed as perfect. Rather, the change from the young belle of Tara to the poverty-stricken lumber dealer and then to a lady sitting on a mountain of wealth shows her faults. The infamous Captain Rhett Butler always finds Scarlett. As her hatred for him increases, the more the reader sees the love between them that she is blind to. There is so much in the book that the movie doesn't include. I'm glad it is so long, for it brings longer enjoyment.",
            "I started to read the story a month before its realease to the theaters on june 26 (my birhtday)and I just fell in love with scarlett and the story being 15 now.I just finished it 2 days ago and that must be the best book I have ever read I think i'll read it again in the future,I would defenitly recomend it to anyone.",
            "Having seen the movie more times than I can count, I decided to read the book. I can only say that the book was not a disappointment. Scarlett O'Hara is the kind of character that you hate one minute and love the next. I was inspired by her determination to survive, but shocked at the schemes she came up with. While the book may be rather long, you won't be able to put it down once you start it.",
            "GWTW is, by far, the greatest romantic piece of historical literature ever published. It takes into account the psychological drama of an egotistical teenage girl coming of age as her world falls apart. Scarlett is portrayed with many imperfections (just as we all have), but in the end she sees the error of her ways. It is an American classic because of its representation of our societies obssession with self, and I believe everyone can see at least a piece of themselves in her, which is what makes the story so compelling. I read it for the first time at the age of 13, and 12 years later it continues to stand as the greatest novel ever written in my mind. I recommend it to anyone interested in analyzing a seemingly bad character and finding the reason behind their actions.",
            "Gone with the Wind was truly the best novel I have ever read and by far my favorite. Margaret Mitchell described every little detail so one could see it vividly, even if it was only in one's imagination. The characters were very much like real people and that is something not all author's are able to accomplish. The sequel, although it was a good effort, could not compare to the original. I think Gone with the Wind is a novel that everyone should read. If you haven't already read GWTW, then you don't know what you are missing. :-) :-)",
            "This book is incredible in every way! When I read it the first time, I became obsessed and was transported back to that era. I thought about it so much that even now, over 3 years later, when I read any part of it, I feels so familiar, a little like coming home. As large as the novel is, you won't regret a single moment you spend reading it. I recomend Gone with the Wind to anyone, especially anyone who loves to be transported to another time and place!",
            "Every time I read this novel, it makes me stop and think how there could be so few genuinley talented people on this earth, with someone like Ms. Mitchell to set such a fine example. Her ability to make the characters jump out from the pages is astounding. Her description of raw, human emotion move Scarlett from haughty, capricious and naive, to indignant, through livid and past loquaciously melancholy. This novel is unforgettably and extraodinarily real, penetrating, and poignant. And as for the sequel, A.R.'s 'Scarlett', I think it was great. Obviously not as good as the original, but the effort was recognized and well noted. (I hope that doesn't in any way sound patronizing). I recommend both novels to all ages, and regardless of what type of books you usually like to read. Guaranteed, you will love it!",
            "I am thirteen, and have just graduated 7th grade. I have read Gone with the Wind twice in the past year. I do believe it is the best novel I have read or ever will read. The first time I read Gone with the Wind, it took me four days to read. (the complete unabridged version). I did not spend all day reading it because I was in Kyoto, Japan siteseeing. The second time I was in school and had homework and other things to do so it took me a week to read it again. I also have read Scarlett it also was very good, but not as good as the original. If you haven't read it yet give Gone with the Wind a try!",
            "When i was reading this book, i thought about it and its characters day and night. I even dreamt about them! Thats how good it is! While reading it, it seems as if you are transported to that era and the characters are there in front of you. It is an immortal novel and people of all ages will continue enjoying it. Even those like me, who are not Americans will enjoy it because it is a novel for all nations. Every nation passes through a revolution or massive change atleast once in its history which turns the structure of its society upside down as shown in this novel. All the emotions portrayed so beautifully in this novel like love, hate, determination, a will to fight and struggle are universal. Without any doubt, this novel is the best that i've ever read.",
            "Being a freshman in high school, my opinions are not usually taken for notice, however, I challenged myself in reading this book and found myself all the stronger a person for it. It truly gives the Southern point of view like nothing lese described to us Yankees. Amazing!",
            "i thought that this was a great book because it was a trying time in our history, and through that one woman got through everyhting. loosing her mother, father, and almost her land, that her father won, and worked. throgh everything, scarlett got her life back. even though the way she did it was not a great way. but rhett was great to her, and she realized that she really loved him when nothing else could be done. too little too late.",
            "Gone With The Wind can be praised in so many words, so many sentences, so many paragraphs, so many pages, that I could simple sit here in front of my computer all day and night raveing on it's every spender and glory. With every word that i put on the screen would bring an even bigger smile to my face. This is not just a book, no it's not even a legend, it goes so farther than that. The word to describe this masterpeice has not been created because nothing till its puplication could have deserved it. I often find myself tring to react to situations in the manner that I think my beloved romodel would have. I have built dreams around this book! I plan to move to the south and live happily knowing it was the base for such workmanship!! I Love The Book!!",
            "I hesitated in reading Gone With the Wind, thinking it would be boring and long. It is long, but definitely not boring. I loved all of the characters -- each with their distinct personalities, strengths and weaknesses. I couldn't put the book down. The film does not even capture one tenth of the gloriousness of Margaret Mitchell's words.",
            "I loved this book. It couldn't have been better. I think that Alexandra Ripley (who wrote Scarlett:The sequel . . .) was wrong to try and &quot;fix&quot; GWTW. It can't be fixed. She didn't realize that Rhett's and Scarlett's relationship couldn't be fixed. GWTW was perfect, and I think Scarlett was cool even if she was spoiled. She's very pretty in the movie. =)",
            "This is by far the best book I have ever read. It is the epitimy of what a love story should be. My favorite character from the book is of course, Scarlett O'Hara, because of her passion for life and her southern charm. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone.",
            "Gone with the wind is the best and most unbelievable book I've ever read. It has so much going on and the characters are so interesting you are drawn to them and their lives. Despite the fact that the book is over a thousand pages, I was sorry when it was over! It was amazing.",
            "I think this book was a wonderful story and very, very well written. The author did a great job of descibing every detail right down to the size of Scarlett's dress. From the moment Scarlett O'Hara met Rhett Butler to the last page the story was filled with excitement, joy, and sorrow. This is the best book I have ever read and I would reccommend it to everyone",
            "The atory is written through Scarlets eyes . It tells of a spoilled southern Belle's life when the war begins and after it ends. While reading the book you also get a feel for the changes that the south went through. while Scarlet is defenatly a girl with spirt she is also a selfish mule. In Mammy's words &quot;a mule with a hores harness. I would defenatly say that the book is written for anyone with any heart at all.",
            "No matter where I am or what i do, GWTW is the most amazing book I have read since The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Ms Mitchell is an artist painting for us what Tara and Atlanta are like. She sculpts for us the flavors of the characters and has a certain way of stimulating all of your senses at once. You can taste, see, hear, smell, and almost feel the world that has been created. Not many authors successfully pull this off here in this world of TV and Movies where it is all right there for you and you don't actually have to think about it.",
            "If you think you know what this book is about because you've seen the movie then think again. Each time I have read it I discover something new. So many richly complex characters and scenes were left out of the film due to time constraints. It is my favorite book of all time, one of those rare works of literature that you can open up to any page and immediately become engrossed in.",
            "This is the best book of all time it is a love story and a story about survival. Scarlett is both a villain and heroine",
            "This is a great book! I love it. You should read it. It took me one year to finish it.",
            "I never really considered reading this book before and I'd never seen the movie. I'd intended to, see the movie that is, but I'd never even thought about reading the book until a friend had it sitting around and wasn't reading it so I said \"what the heck, what's the drama all about?\".Having the forward done by Pat Conroy certainly helped as he is one of my favorite all time authors, so I dug in. I can't believe I'd never had this book recommend to me before, especially since I'm an outspoken hater of Lincoln (may he and Sherman burn in hell forever). I mean I really hate murderous invaders so hating Lincoln is easy, I never understood how people can make a hero out of both Washington (fighting for self rule) and Lincoln (invading to stop self rule), but I digress.What was really amazing about this book is that Mitchell managed to give a history lesson and wonderful historical flavor without ever actually \"telling\" the reader, she just \"showed\" us and it was wonderful and delightful to read.The is so much rewritten history and people really don't understand much of what they believe or even why they believe it so anyone that thinks they know the about the invasion of the South in the War of 61 and they haven't read this, they are not being honest in what they say they know, they can't be. The way the characters show how life was compared to what we are often taught or simply left to believe because we view things through modern lenses is really an amazing feat and the reason why this is such a good novel.Now to the love and the hate and the clash of personalities and the human nature and on and on, I can't say enough about how great this book is. So much popular modern writing is just trash, or fluff, compared to this depth of characterization, and here's a little clue why: modern writers tend to give us hero's with minor flaws, Scarlet is written very sympathetically, one can't help but love her, and love her deeply in fact, yet she's often wicked, she's certainly totally self absorbed and in modern times we'd probably call her a complete narcissist, BUT we the reader simply can't help but love her.The race relationships in the book are very insightful and give the reader understanding into the culture and mores of the time, and read with a view to the future one can see the root of much of today's racial problems in America, the South was destroyed by the North, the slaves may have been freed in one quick stroke, but they were free for what? The economy was destroyed, enormous wealth was destroyed, and the seeds of resentment and hatred were watered, not just in the hearts of the Southern white upper classes, but in the Northern whites, the poor, the blacks and everyone that suffered huge loss by the actions of state in it's conquest for power.I wish I'd read this book sooner, but now that I have I'll continue to recommend it to any one interested in a great novel of American and Confederate history, and of love, love the universal, the love of family, the love of a woman. Love and hatred, two sides of the same coin and separated by slivers of fate.",
            "The hard cover book - it's actual cover was really disappointingly plain and as it was a present, I felt let down to give such a plain gift. The book itself is a classic and I am sure my daughter will enjoy reading it.",
            "This item I received in prestine condition. It is a rare version of the book in the first place (and antique), so that's very impressive. The shipping time was very fast as well, and there was even a cordial note inside the book thanking me for my purchase and with added information. Very pleased!",
            "I honestly purchased the kindle edition Of this book by mistake, but decided to give it a go. I'm so glad I did! What a wonderful historical drama. The characters created and the setting during the social and political upheaval of the us civil war makes this book a must read for anyone into historical novels true or not.",
            "\"Gone with the Wind\" by Margaret Mitchell is an important work of literature set in the times of the American Civil War. It is a long book, but I read it quickly. Everytime the story started to slow down, something big happened which brought the momentum back.I would like to warn potential readers however that this not a book to read if you want to sit back and have a relaxing read. The book has a story that is very tumultuous and at times sad. This book is one of the most dramatic books I have read.The book follows the life of a 16 year-old girl in Confederate Georgia called Scarlett O'hara. She is attractive both physically and in the manner in which she acts. I had a huge crush on her when I was reading the book. She wants desperately to marry a young man called Ashley Wilkes who is engaged to a nice girl called Melanie.The book has a number of characters that appear in it also. The most noteworthy is Rhett Butler. Rhett Butler is a speculator who becomes a hero in Georgia for bringing supplies and goods to it through the Union blockade. Although people are grateful to him for bringing in supplies and goods, some have issues with his lack of moral convictions. His character is so macho, he is too macho. To me he seemed like a monster. At the beginning of the book Scarlett has a low opinion of him and I thought that was understandable. I'm a guy, so I don't know what exactly women would think of him, but I suspect that some women might be turned on by his predatory nature viewing him as extremely masculine.Although Scarlett is more physically attractive than Melanie, the girl Ashley Wilkes is engaged to, I actually thought that Melanie was more romantic than the mean-spirited Scarlett O'hara. At times I really felt bad for Melanie who wasn't loved enough by Ashley.\"Gone with the Wind\" takes place during the Civil War and fortunately it doesn't romanticize it. The book makes it clear that many soldiers were coming home maimed or crippled. The book shows that the Civil War was a gruesome conflict.From reading about Scarlett O'hara in \"Gone with the Wind\" I feel that I got a real insight into how women like her think. I now know that such women are not entirely noble although they may claim to be.",
            "I purchased Gone with the Wind (paperback) for my wife's 58th birthday because she had finally worn out the copy she has read repeatedly over the years since high school. We meant to replace it for more than a year, and I came up with the idea to surprise her with it, and her birthday was the perfect time. She told me once that while in high school the book was assigned and she just could not get herself through it, but it was a big deal at the local theater and viewing the movie helped her ace the test! Then post graduation she picked up the book and the rest is history. My purchase has made me a hero. My thanks for filling the order quickly and the timely delivering was greatly appreciated.",

I LOVE THE BOOK EVEN MORE THAN THE MOVIE. SO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? BUY YOUR COPY ALREADY.",
            "Epic about the Civil War and Reconstruction and a southern belle named Scarlett O'Hara. She goes through three marriages, children, murder and incredible hardships but pulls through. A lot of people don't know this but it won a Pulitzer Pize for fiction in 1937. Everybody knows about the movie that came out in 1939 and is now a classic.I'm not a fan of romance novels OR historical fiction but I LOVE this book. It shows truthfully (I heard) what the South was like before and after the war. It explains the rites and passages of that era...but never in a boring or leaden manner. Author Margaret Mitchell does it in a matter of fact manner that makes it easily accessible. She makes the characters seem like real people (even though Melanie is a little bit TOO saint-like) and draws you into their troubles and worries. Also I've seen the movie at least nine times and this compares favorably to it. There are some significant changes--Scarlett is 16 in the book, she has THREE children and is desribed as not being pretty (which Vivien Leigh certainly was in the movie), but they're minor. In fact the book helps explain some things that were left out of the movie and clarifies some of the actions of certain characters. But, even on its own, it's a GREAT book. VERY long but never dull. A classic. Pick this one up. Ignore the dreadful sequel \"Scarlett\".",
            "After finishing Margaret Mitchell's first and only novel, the one that landed her a Pulitzer Prize and was adapted into a film that is considered one of the best movies of all time, I felt what was to be expected: completely exhausted. Obviously a book this size cannot be completed in one sitting, and (since I was determined not to rush it) it took me the better part of two weeks to get through it; two weeks to struggle through the American Civil War and its aftermaths, not to mention the tempestuous relationship between four larger-than-life individuals: Melanie Hamilton, Rhett Butler, Ashley Wilkes and the infamous Scarlett O'Hara.Of course, I use the word \"struggle\" in a good way, as this is a book that sucks you up into the trials and tribulations of the time, and spits you out the other side. By its end, I was completely drained, something that no book has left me sinceTess of the D'ubervilles: 2500 Headwords (Oxford Bookworms Library).Scarlett O'Hara is a young Southern belle, one of the most popular debutantes in her community. Although she has power over almost every single young man she knows, one continues to elude her. She has loved Ashley Wilkes since she was fourteen years old, and reacts badly when she hears that he is to be married to Melanie Wilkes - a timid young woman that Scarlett despises.After loosing her temper with Ashley (after her declarations of love to him are not reciprocated, despite an admission that he *does* care for her), she is humiliated to find that their encounter was secretly witnessed by the amoral Captain Rhett Butler, a man with a bad reputation who seems oddly amused at Scarlett's conduct. Furious at both men and incapable of understanding either, Scarlett is barely of aware of the political tensions rising around her.Yet Scarlett is about to be swept up in a conflict far beyond the confines of her heart: the Confederacy and the Yankees have declared war, and her entire world is thrown into chaos. Life is whittled down to its most basic elements: hunger, death, love, birth, morals and - paramount to this particular story - survival. In particular, a question that arises during the story is (particularly in relation to Scarlett), what is survival worth?In creating Scarlett, Mitchell has created one of the most intriguing literary figures of all time. Spoilt, selfish, practical, driven, determined, passionate and often unforgivably short-sighted, Scarlett is an individual whose desire for comfort and security gradually erode away at any sense of right and wrong, her development as a complete individual, and her even personal dignity. Just as Macbeth had his ambition and Othello had his jealously, Scarlett's fatal flaw is her inability to *understand*.She does not understand any of the three most important people in her life (Melanie, Ashley and Rhett), she does not understand her own people or what drives them (she is frustrated at their blind ability to the Cause), and she does not understand the sacrifices that must be made in order for her to find contentment...that is, she does not understand until it is too late.This is character study at its most nuanced, for Scarlett is totally believable and understandable, even when she's doing morally reprehensible things. At the beginning of the novel, her faults are somewhat amusing - the fact that she hates the war mostly because it deprives her of the luxury that she loves, and that she loves Ashley even though she finds him unfathomable.Later though, it takes on a more tragic air, as inner peace continues to elude her and we gradually discover the loneliness that comes with total self-interest. It's beautiful, haunting, heart-rending stuff.However, as it seems with every famous book, there is some controversy and it largely concerns Mitchell's treatment of the pre-war South. Mitchell would love to have us believe that the pre-war South was a golden age of chivalrous landowners that treated their ladies like jewels and their slaves like children. When their society is swept away by the winds of war, we are meant to feel grief, as though a living thing has been snuffed out and its memory slowly dying in the remnants of the people who are left to linger on. Ultimately the book is what it is, and I would certainly still recommend it despite some of its dated and overly-romantic views of the South.I actually watched the movie before reading the novel (it was want wanted me to get hold of the book), and I must say that the two go hand in hand. After reading the book I realized how spot-on the choices in casting the movie were, and it was interesting to see what elements of the book the screenwriters decided to cut; semi-important characters like Will Benteen and Archie, and events like the Yankees raiding Tara and circumstances surrounding Gerald's death. Most surprising in the book was the fact that Scarlett actually had three children, one to each of her husbands. The movie kept only Bonnie, and to be honest, I could understand why this decision was made, considering Wade and Ella have very little to do in the story, and are largely ignored, by the author as well as their mother.Ultimately, the driving force in the book is not the attention to historical detail, the clear and vivid prose, or the weight of grandeur and importance that lies on every page; it is the complex and fascinating relationship between the four major characters: the angelic Melanie, the noble Ashley, the rakish Rhett and the driven Scarlett - and I don't just mean how Scarlett relates to each of them. Just as intriguing is Rhett's admiration and protectiveness toward Melanie, Melanie's blind devotion to Scarlett, and the fact that Rhett and Ashley are uncannily similar in thought, though not deed. The quartet makes up one of the most tangled and intriguing set of relationships ever put to paper, and that alone is worth the time it will take to read \"Gone with the Wind\".",
            "Atlanta, Georgia- No other book has defined the south more than Gone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell. Growing up in the south, I deemed it was time to sit down and read this classic which is in celebrating seventy five years in print.In the 75th Anniversary addition, Pat Conroy write a preface where he chronicles how this book was a bond between he and his mother as she would read it to him and how it profoundly influenced his writings.With over a 900 pages, it is a brick of a book but it does masterfully captures the consequences of what we refer in the south as \"the war of northern aggression\".The principle character Scarlett evolves from a young women ready to be conquered by a wide array of suitors. Her love Ashley has been wooed away and she spends a lifetime trying to pave her way. The allusive Rhett Butler fails to conquer this steel magnolia who always keeps hope alive by reiterating that tomorrow is a new day.Gone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell takes you to the allure of the gentile world of the south. This book should be savored by any book lover once in their reading odyssey.",

            "GWTW is, hands down, the greatest American novel. In my opinion, it is the greatest novel ever written. When I first read GWTW, I couldn't wait to get to the parts about Scarlett and Rhett. Now, though I still love the interplay between them, I read it for the incredible detail to history. Margaret Mitchell grew up sitting on the knees of old confederate soldiers while they reminisced about the war, then took that treasure and masterfully provided a moving account of the war and it's aftermath through the eyes of Scarlett O'Hara. The wonderful thing is that she is able to give this history lesson all wrapped up in the greatest love story of all times! All the characters are memorable - Mammy, Gerald O'Hara, Ashley, Melanie, not to mention the near-perfect man, Rhett Butler! And then there is Scarlett... While many people who have only seen the movie don't like Scarlett, no one who reads the book can help but admire her sheer determination to overcome the tragedy of the war and rebuild her life. At the same time, it is heart wrenching to see her throwing away the love of her true soul mate and ruining her life because of the fears the war sprouted in her. I admire Scarlett on many levels, and think she is the most vivid heroine in literature because of her failings and her strength. If you could capture Scarlett's fire and Melanie's kindness and roll them into one woman, she could rule the world and be adored by all. If you want a book that will grab your heart and capture your emotions, you must read Gone With The Wind!",

            "at first when i saw how thick GWTW was, I felt like i couldn't finish it. But, by watching the movie, I wanted to read the book. I have nothing bad to say about this book. It's amazing and a person can connect with one of the character immediatly. Scarlett is the one, who is vain, and likes to get her way with everything. Rhett is a great guy... just that his love dies out for Scarlett in the end. the funniest character i consider to be is Mammy. A book that should be in everyone's library.",
            "Scarlett O'Hara is born to an Irish father and Southern belle mother in 1840's Georgia. Pampered all her life, Scarlett pursues the love of Ashley Wilkes, only to be rebuffed.

Throughout his exploits as a blockade runner, he pursues Scarlett while she pines fruitlessly for Ashley.Set against the swirling backdrop of the Civil War, Gone With the Wind is meticulously researched and exceedingly well written.

            "\"Gone with the Wind\" - Book ReviewThis is a story of love, of loss, and of courage. Margaret Mitchell created an amazing story, romance saga of love and the most sentimental portrait of the Civil War. \"Gone with the Wind\" in my opinion is deserving of a five-star rating, because it is by far the greatest story ever written. Mitchell's \"Gone with the Wind\" is the story of Scarlett O'Hara, a spoiled southern beautiful woman, whose life is suddenly caught up in the turmoil of the American Civil War. Through her fights during the war and the six years of Reconstruction that follow, author showed her life pass through three husbands and three children. Within this background, we observe Scarlett's conflict against external and internal conflicts, her losses, gains, and hopes. Author described bright vivid characters and relationship between people, but she did not attach great importance to some problem, such as slavery; the book is very interesting and I certainly would recommend it to just about anyone.\"Gone with the Wind\" by Margaret Mitchell is a war novel, a historical romance, a comedy of manners, a bitter lamentation, a cry of the heart, and a long, cold-hearted look at the character of this one lovely woman. It is undoubtedly the classic novel of Civil War. The major characteristic that enables it to achieve its seriousness also criticizes Scarlett O'Hara to a life of unrequited love and dooms her potential for happiness with Rhett Butler. Mitchell created the character, Scarlett, wonderfully. She had spunk, determination, intelligence, and selfishness-traits that made her personality interesting. If Scarlett needs something bad enough, she will not hesitate to throw away proper social conduct or her own personal goals. She does what ever she needs to get her by. Then there is Rhett. He is this attractive man who is no gentleman. He brought a little bit of light into the dark parts of the book. He seems to be just a rude, ill-behaved man at first, but later his character is deep and full of emotion and feelings. Margaret Mitchell created a bond and passion between these two characters. It was a wonderful romance, with love and anger-a sort of bittersweet romance. Although Scarlett is a strong and independent woman, most people can relate to her because she makes mistakes like a normal human. This book examines different types of strength. Whether it is Mammy's honorable courage and dignity, or Rhett's keen level-headedness, or Melanie's Christian devotion to people, each person has his or her own root from which they draw their strength.The perspective is strength because it permits the author to vividly portray the destruction of Southern society better than any battlefield-centered novel could. Unfortunately, it also leaves the author, and therefore Scarlet as well, incapable of understanding the male characters. They are merely personalities that fade in-and-out of the background to shape the narrative. While they are characters that can stand up off the page and cast a shadow, there is no tone or timbre in their images. Some author's descriptions of the reconstruction are degraded. For example, blacks were only happy being slaves. Big Sam says he had enough of freedom and wants to go back to Tara. He even states doubtfully that while in the north whites wanted him to sit at the table like he was their equal, but he could not do it because he is not the equal to whites. At one point Mitchell is describing how the southern whites hate the Yankees so much because the Yankees have money and food and power and they do not, yet she does not have any sense of irony to see that the whites are in the position that they put the slaves in for centuries.If someone loves historical fiction with a little romance, this book is perfect for their. The writing is superb, and the plot is dramatic and sad, but it includes enough of Scarlett's triumphs of strength that sets it apart from all other books. Scarlett O'Hara is the perfect Southern belle who is incredible to read about. How she attracts men with her charm and little helpless acts is unbelievable. She is used to having slaves serve her and she treats them with little or no respect until she needs them. One cannot stop thinking about how much they would hate Scarlet if she was real, but they are not able to stop feeling sorry for her and they want to help her to realize how stupid she is. This is a must read for any person who loves classic literature.\"Gone with the Wind\" is really one of the world's most well written romance novels. Set in the backdrop of the American Civil War in the eighteen century, it tells the story of the people who fought for survival during the War and the Reconstruction Period through sheer shrewd wits and cunning business methods. Margaret Mitchell is an absolute talent. She was nowhere close to the cheap romance writer many had portrayed her to be- she was a realist. She was actually writing about how human spirit and determination, how it can be applied to help one over such obstacles. Mitchell's book broke sales records. Within a year of publication, 1,383,000 copies had been sold. Today, sales stand at over 21,000,000. In 1937 \"Gone with the Wind\" was awarded the Pulitzer Prize.",
            "This is the first phrase in the book to describe the spoiled Scarlett O' Hara, who was made immoral by Viven Leigh in the movie verison of ' Gone with the Wind' ( 1939 ). The book is 1024 pages, which is long, but the book is so good, you wouldn't even realize how many pages there are, and you'll be asking for more.The story is about a spoiled Southern Belle named Scarlett O' Hara, who lives in Georgia on her family Plantion, and basically lives the life of a southern belle of her time ( mid-1800's ). Scarlett gets anything she wants, all she has to do is bat her eyelashes. But the one man she wants, Ashley Hamiltion, she can't give. No matter how hard she trys, she just can't get him, and to make matters worst. He's marrying the mousy-type Melanie. Scarlett than goes through the rest of the book, trying to get Ashley through revenge and through her love. Along the way, she meets the handsome Rhett Butler, the man who truly wants to be the only one for Scarlett, but knows he never can.If your fan of the movie ( like I am before I read the book ), then you would notice BIG differences between the two. But the book describes each character perfectly, Scarlett is even more interesting to read about. For movie fans, hearing Scarlett's thoughts is even more of a treat. I'll recommend this book to ANYONE.",
            "Margaret Mitchell was born in Atlanta in November 1900. When she was around thirteen, her family, affluent but not wealthy, moved into a big house on Peachtree Street, one of the principal settings for Gone with the Wind, which she began writing in 1926. The Macmillan Company published Gone with the Wind in May 1936; it won the Pulitzer Prize in 1937. The movie, which won ten Academy Awards, premiered in Atlantic City on December 15, 1939.I read the &#65533;Special Commemorative 60th-Anniversary Edition&#65533; (paperback) purchased from Amazon.com in February 2003, which commemorates the film, not the book. The back cover of that edition quotes the Washington Post claiming it&#65533;s &#65533;The greatest love story of our time, the story of Scarlett O&#65533;Hara and Rhett Butler&#65533;.&#65533; I suspect the person who wrote that saw the movie, but did not read the book. If it&#65533;s the love story that interests you, I suggest you buy the video. If you want to understand the origins of the South&#65533;s point of view though, at least the upper middle class Georgian point of view, then read this book.I was raised in Connecticut and have been often perplexed by the notions of some of my Southern white peers, puzzled for example by the intractable bigotry of intelligent people who are unwilling to understand that they ought to know better. Conversely, I&#65533;ve admired the generous, unselfish, seemingly pointless hospitality given me by a Southern adversary, a rival, so incongruent that it smacked of hypocrisy. Having read Gone with the Wind, I&#65533;m less perplexed and puzzled now. These people were bred on deep roots.Margaret Mitchell fashioned her novel from stories about slavery, the Civil War, reconstruction and abolition told by those who had survived those dramatic events. The people who lived through those terrible times, or their children, told those stories. From these tales, Margaret Mitchell painted a broad panorama of a culture in forced transformation: The brutal and reprehensible conduct of the Yankees, the greed of the carpetbaggers, the noble origins of the KKK, and the corruption of the North&#65533;s reconstruction. It is Southern noblesse telling the story of their decline. Margaret Mitchell is their apologist.The paperback version I read has 1024 pages of small type with narrow margins. Mitchell&#65533;s writing is sometimes exciting, but often it&#65533;s tedious. Descriptions tend to be excessive, and dialogue is often more like monologue. This style may have been fashionable fifty years ago, but I&#65533;ll deduct a star for it today.",
            "WOW~ There is barely enough words to describe how great it is, so I say, Thank You Margret Mitchell, for such a wonderful book. To say the least, I've read so much romance that I can literally guess what happens at the end of each novel (and Jane Austen counts) but this one is just fantastic. However I only gave it four stars because of1)how many man Scarlett has married-Charles, Frank, Rhett~2)I cannot give it four and a half starsI must say thought, to those who love this book, steer clear away from the supposed sequel: \"Scarlett: The Sequel to Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind\" or \"Rhett Butler's People\" It is just a horror to see such a great book have such a terrible sequel for an ending.Anyways, for those who have not yet read this book, HAPPY READING!",
            "What can I say? This one is a classic! A very good historical romance set in the south during and after the Civil War. I cannot help but love and hate Scarlett O'Hara, both for her feisty spirit, her stubborn disposition, and her passion for the unobtainable. If you've never read this book, you should.",
            "Yes, the book is racist, but let's cut Mitchell a little slack. She was a person of her place and time. There were no documentaries to compete with \"Birth of a Nation,\" no internet, and entire towns were segregated. Most white people never heard the other side of the story. Who is to say what Mitchell's attitudes would be today? Probably, like most of the country, she would have become much more thoughtful.While it's tough not to cringe at the casual use of the n-word and \"darky\" in the book, it is what Mitchell knew. Even sweet, precious Melanie decried going up north because her son would have to go to school with \"pickaninnies.\" Forgiving her for romanticizing a vile, inhuman system that degraded women of all colors, \"crackers,\" and black men is easy, because she knew little else. There is no excuse for the twits who swoon over the book and ignore inconvenient facts, because they know better (or should).It takes nothing away from the fact that Mitchell was an awesome writer who could bring characters and settings to life like nobody else. She and J. K. Rowling are about the only two writers who can keep me up reading at night when I have to go to work the next day.",
            "When I read the first sentence of \"Gone with the Wind\" I was forever hooked. The description of the glitz and glamour of Southern life, the odd perspective on the civil war, the turbulence of Rhett Butler's and Scarlett O'Hara's stormy relationship,it is all so well-crafted. The only reason why one might hesitate to read the book is, it was written by a Southener and you do have to endure insults hurled upon the \"darkies\". The good \"darkies\" are the ones that decide to stay with their masters, and it is very unrealistic in that sense. Other than that, it is worth reading. Two thumbs way, way up!",
            "When I saw this book on my mom's bookshelf two years ago, I wanted to read it because I thought that that would make me a &quot;grown up&quot;. But reading it was better than that. I was fascinated by the Southern way of life, as I had only heard bad things about the Confederacy in my history class (it was soooo one-sided). It seemed so beautiful, what with the chivalrous gentlemen and their demure ladies. It was a world where Melanie completely belonged, but Scarlett was in the wrong age. I was so frusterated to see how Scarlett had to forfeit friends and society to keep herself alive. It's hard to like her, but it's impossible not to! She's cold, dismissive to her friends, and uses her looks to get her way- but you like her anyway, no matter how much you admire the other characters for their sweetness and chivalry. You like that she's willing to do everything for Ashley, for Gerald, for Tara. And you're upset when Rhett leaves her even though she completely deserved it. She can get things done, and she will, and we like her. For me, the face of the Confederacy will always be the face of Scarlett O'Hara- con artist, tart, hypocrite, and so much more. And yet still, a part of me wishes that I had been a part of that face.",
            "...This great book.... I read it when I was 16 and since then I read it countless times. Every character and all the dialounge I love. Charles declaration of love to Scarlett is sooo cute. GranMa's Fontaine's remincing of the massacre of her family was perfectly done. Mammy's telling of Rhett going out of his mind after Bonnie's death. Scarlett promise to never going hungry again is a complete classic that every Southerner should learn and know by heart. Melanie's giving birth to Beau is so real. NO women that small and narrow should give birth and if she does she should thank God she lived after the birth. Scarlett's telling Melanie to scream and not to be brave sounded like my mother when Mother told my sister to yell all she wanted. My nephew weighed eleven pounds. There is so much I want to say here. I really will never understand the non-reading public. The stories here in this book are so beatiful. Even if the Story is old and long how can persn resist after the first page. Scarlett to me is a real person. So what if she is spoiled brat. At least she knows what she wants. But...her being in love with Ashley is beyond me. He is pathetic. Rhett. Wow!! What a man. Now that is a Man I would love to have for myself. Again I will never under Scarlett here. What was she thinking in letting a fine man like Rhett to get away mooning over a man like Ashley, then realizing too late that she never \"really\" loved him? WELL, I least I hope I know she had to have gotten him back. And, I'm not talking at all about that horrid book \"SCARLETT\" either. I don't need that book to continue the story for me. I like to think I can continue the story in my mind. After all tomorrow is another day.",
            "Margaret Mitchell's requiem of the South succeeds to embrace both the reader and her topic because of the tremendous blend of themes which resound throughout this masterful novel.First, she introduces us to the concept of peace versus war: \"All wars are sacred, to those who have to fight them. If the people who started them did not make wars sacred, who would be foolish enough to fight?\" And, of course business pragmatist Rhett Butler concludes, \"All wars are in realty money squabbles. But so few people ever realize it. Their ears are too full of bugles and drums . . . \" This dialogue of sanctity of war versus business pragmatism constantly resounds in the book.Secondly, is how men treat other men. And, within this theme are numerous subtopics. The most obvious is the North versus the South. \"Arrogance and callousness for the conquerors, bitter endurance and hatred for the conquered.\" When you start a war - know that at the end you still have an enemy, and that enemy's feelings toward you may be stronger and more bitter! The other obvious theme is white versus black. Slavery versus freedom for the \"darkies.\" And, although that serfdom appears to symbiotically exist in the Camelot of the Georgian south, Ashley Wilkes tells Scarlett O'Hara at one time that had there been no war and had his father died with slavery still intact, he would have freed his slaves as his methodically conceived logical conclusion was to do the right thing : free men.Ashley Wilkes, who displays another great theme of old antebellum South's gentlemen in the new world of the Reconstruction South, is both hero and goat. Rhett Butler always tells Scarlett that Ashley's days of importance ended when his environs were burnt to ashes at the war's end. She never agrees, at least until the end. And, while she disagrees with Rhett about Ashley, they gang up on her on yet another masterful man versus man theme: employment of convict labor. Treated worse than slaves, convicts are the backbone to cheap labor after the war. But, for their hard work they are beaten and fed little and paid less. Ashley, in her post-starvation period, will do almost everything to avoid experiencing hunger again - including hiring white northerners to be her conscripted laborers.Thirdly, we learn about truth versus appearance. Rhett and most of the old South depict the wonderment of southern civility - never say a bad thing about anyone, and always show respect and manners to those about you. This applies to many slaves as well. Ashley and his wife, Melanie (Melly), are embodiments of such gentile mannerisms. Scarlett's mother Ellen was another. Scarlett's father, Gerald O'Hara, and Scarlett are not. But, Scarlett and her father were truthful. The Irish in father and daughter refused to fub, they refused to be concerned about the foderol scurried about by gossip - holding such lack of care when the idle gossip festered to outright defamatory lies. Rhett, who loves the lack of deception in Scarlett's character, often criticizes his peers for their hypocrisy. Rhett admits to engaging in the same for purposes of business; but, as a man he refuses to be known as another who says what he does not mean. But, Rhett, as time progresses in the book, succumbs to the gossip and engages in the very hypocrisy he despises.Fourthly, the issue of uneven playing field resounds. Rich versus poor. Slave owner versus slave. Business owner versus convict labor. South versus North. And, hidden within these themes is Mitchell's greatest announcement: feminism. Scarlett who owns businesses after the war, is criticized by all men and societal women for engaging in a man's world. Even with her success, she is snubbed by the hob nob crowd. But, perhaps greatest in this theme is the concept of men having rights which women cannot. Rhett gallivants with the local prostitute Belle without concern, while one emotional hug held by life-long friends and neighbors Scarlett and Ashley is identified as \"adultery.\" When Rhett confronts her about this, Scarlett retaliates, \"You are nothing but a drunken beast who's been with bad women so long that you can't understand anything else but badness. You've lived in dirt too long to know anything else. You are jealous of something you can't understand. Good night.\"Other themes also exist: building versus destroying; growing up versus growing old; Catholics versus Christians; love for family versus love for spouses; raising children versus burying children . . .As these themes ebb and flow and occasionally eddy in this ocean-sized novel, the characters' personalities grow and become embodiments of many stereotypical Southern mainstays. And, to add to the characters, Mitchell uses incredibly detailed phonetic spellings for the crackers' and slaves' dialogues. Her detailed description of people's clothing and household interiors (and exteriors) brand indelible images into the readers' minds. This is writing!Mitchell, whose own life is a mixture of angelic Melly and defiant Scarlett, had three marriages and worked (as a journalist) in a man's world. She knew that her publication would be much more difficult than a man's work - especially one of such largess. But, like Scarlett, she persevered and triumphed. Mitchell's name remains among the most known in the American literary world - not bad for a small girl from Atlanta.So many passages of this book flow with delicate prose that make it an incredibly easy 960-page read. In Pat Conroy's preface, that great southern writer states, \"This is The Illiad with a Southern accent, burning with the humiliation of Reconstruction. . . Gone with the Wind was not just a book, it was an answer, a clenched fist raised to the North, an anthem of defiance. If you could not defeat the Yankees on the battlefield, then by God, one of your women could rise from the ashes of humiliation to write more powerfully than the enemy and all the historians and novelists who sang the praises of the Union.\"",
            "Gone with the Wind is the story of Scarlett O'Hara (and so much more). When the reader meets Scarlett, it is pre-civil war in the South. The reader gets to see plantation life on Tara and in the Country as it really was. Mitchell takes the reader through the Civil War, how life changed for those that didn't go of to war, how life changed for everyone after it, the mentality of those who survived it and how they lived afterwards. The reader gets to watch these character develop and change with the times.Mitchell's character description is amazing! As a reader, you feel transported into this world, as if these characters are your friends, and as if you are a part of this town - just another neighbor. You will feel for each and everyone in some way at some time. You'll not want to put the book down, nor will you want it to end....What can one really say about this book other than it is a great read and one that everyone should pick up!",
            "Many people only know Gone With The Wind through the beautiful 1939 David O. Selznick film. That is a disappointment, as the novel is so much richer and complex than the film could realize.Written in the mid 1930s by a novice writer, it nonethe less manages to evoke the spirit of the Civil War and the passion that is Scarlett O'Hara.While commonly viewed as a war novel, it is actually much more: both a brilliant comedy of manners and the first frankly feminist novel written. Ms. Mitchell manages to make us care about Scarlett, while allowing us also to laugh at her occasionally.Do not be put off by the book's length. While an enormous undertaking, it moves along at a breakneck pace, and is absorbing from the very first page.Some have criticized the book for its racist portrayal of the black characters. While it does seem so from a 21st Century perspective, that can perhaps be forgiven when remembering that it was written by a Southerner in the early 20th Century. In any event, some of the most noble, sympathetic characters of the book are black and slaves.This is a book to enjoy and savor more than once. The 60th Anniversary Edition is especially nice, coming in a slipcover and containing analysis of the book by other authors and literary critics.",
            "If you read the other customer reviews, you will definitely guess that people love this book. They really, really love it.I read this book primarily because it is such a major piece of 20th century American Literature and film and I'm glad I read it. Several friends saw the book on my table and assumed my wife was reading it. I took some teasing over it.I liked it more than I expected to but I couldn't quite get past some of the views expressed or supported. I do think Mitchell goes further than just showing how southerners thought of blacks and actually has sympathy for some of the attitudes.Mitchell writes a lot of good scenes and social situations. Scarlett is quite a character. She is selfish, egotistical, forceful and mean. She's also loyal, smart and has incredible inner strength. To Margaret Mitchell's credit, she wrote an incredibly strong female character who is consistently interesting.For a 1000ish page book, it moves quickly but I really did find it to be way, way too long. A lot of the book simply reinforces the Scarlett character and, for me, she could have left out quite a bit of it without losing much. When you love a book, it can't be too long so I expect your view of the book's length will depend on how much you're enjoying it.If I could have forgotten the attitudes expressed towards slavery then I would have given this a higher rating. I couldn't manage to do it though. There are many books with accurate depictions of slavery and the attitude of whites towards slaves and they are very powerful. I think the character that bothers me the most is Rhett Butler. He is a smart, dashing scoundrel who loves Scarlett and is the only one who really knows her nature. He is also a character who admittedly shot a n----r for getting uppity with a white. I realize it was written in the 1930s and described a violent time but I still had some difficulty with it.The book is loaded with memorable quotes and it is a classic with larger than life characters that people love.So, I expect many readers will continue to love this book and I don't begrudge them that but I just couldn't get past certain things. The 3 star rating is almost an abstention regarding whether I recommend it.",
            "As powerful today as when it came out more than 70 years ago. Criticisms that it glorifies the Confederacy are misguided. While still honoring those who survived incredible hardship and loss, Margaret Mitchell skewers the pretensions of those who blindly believed in \"The Cause.\" Her portrayal of how blacks were treated manages to convey her obvious belief that in many respects some slaves were better people than their masters. A great love story set in the midst of a war that is fought mostly offstage. Her prose is magnificent, creating characters and a world that are unique in American literature. An aside: Hollywood did a magnificent job making a classic movie from such a huge book.",
            "Gone With The Wind is timeless. Though the movie gives an overview of the book, there is so much more that is revealed in the book. It reveals much more about each character; it gives a background about Tara and its acquistion; it gives more insight into the relationships between the characters. The historical era is described so that the reader can understand the southern culture of that time. I have read the book at least 5 times, and each time I get something new from the book.",
            "The book was so much better than the movie. One of my new favorite books, will read over and over.",
            "\"And she heard for the first time, without knowing it, the Rebel yell.\"I read Gone With the Wind years ago but was so happy to revisit it as a book club choice. I was surprised by how many people struck up a conversation about it as I carried it with me when I travelled. Imagine writing something that still instigates conversations and connections among strangers who have only this book in common? Love it or hate it, you can't deny the impact it's had.The first time I read this I was in my early 20's. I fell completely in love with every moment. Over 10 years later I was surprised by how my reactions to the characters changed. I had less tolerance for Scarlett and increased respect for Melanie. I was more affected by the soldiers and less swept up in the romance. I still thought Ashley needed a backbone...Despite those differences, my love for the characters did not change. My favorite characters are those with flaws. I cannot become completely encompassed by perfection but prefer some characteristics I can love and some I can hate. In that, Gone With the Wind is spot on. I hope I find this book in my hand a third time, another 10 years from now.",
            "This book is unlike any other that I have encountered thus far. It is a dinamic story of a firey young southern girl forced to come to grips with the realities of the war-torn south. Once you start reading you will not be able to put this book down. The details that Mitchell includes are breathtaking and make you feel as if you are back in the days of the old south. The character of Scarlett O'Hara is inspiring. This book is many stories in one; it is a coming-of-age piece, a love story, a war story, and a historical novel. All of these genres come together to create a captivating work of art.",
            "Gone with the wind is one of those storys that wraps you up into the story waiting to find out what is going to happen next to Scarlett. Yet it is the most to deal on real life issues back in the 1860's and post civil war. Even if it is fictional.",
            "A wonderful fascinating historical novel, an intriguing character study, and yes, of course, a tragic love story - this is one of 20th century masterpieces and a must-read for anyone.And this doesn't mean that the characters of the book are perfect or their actions right - instead the imperfections of Scarlett, Rhett and others are what make the story work. Mitchel makes them so that anyone really can identify with them at some point, making the story very realistic and believable. No they are not perfect and their bad traits are not extolled or forgiven, as some reviewers here might think. Indeed, the events in the story reflect this point. (Why do u think Scarlett is left all alone in the end?) If anyone thinks that giving your daughter Gone with the Wind to read would make her think or behave like Scarlett at her worst they are very, very wrong and they just don't get the main idea of the novel.Its so sad, frustrating, bittersweet and great and i love it. I very much recommend this book.",
            "Gone With the Wind, by Margaret Mitchell, is an amazing book based rural Georgia from the Civil War antebellum to Reconstruction. Scarlett O'Hara begins as a sixteen-year-old belle of the county, but ends up facing perils the kind of which she could never imagine. In the book, love holds Scarlett together, but in the end fails her. Mitchell's style is unique and distinguishable. The moral value of this book is unusually displayed by the contradictions to it made by Scarlett. I loved reading about Scarlett's relationships with her friends and, more interestingly, her enemies. Though it is sometimes difficult to like Scarlett, it is impossible to ever hate Mitchell's messages throughout this amazing epic novel.",
            "I agree with the woman from the UK. This is ridiculous. Slavery was horrible but guess what ? It happened, so I guess what we should conclude from what you are saying is that we should just forget about Hitler and the concentration camps and pretend like it never happened. The world can be a horrible place so while we're here why don't we face the facts and try to learn from history. Besides, history repeats itself. So, back to the book. WOW! This is the best book I've ever read. Reading this book you realize how horrible slavery was but also what hell Southerner's went through during this period. After all nearly one-fourth of the population of the U.S. was wiped out because of the Civil war and it tells about the people who really changed the South, the carpetbaggers! I saw the movie and after having read the book I can't believe some of the powerful scenes they left out. Like when the Union soldiers were going through Tara and almost took Charles' sword. Or when the Calvert girl came to tell everyone she was going to marry. It just goes on and on. Did you know that MM wrote GWTW for her own pleasure and never thought of herself as a good writer. One day a publisher friend from NY dropped by and saw hundreds of sheets of papers in dissaray and asked if he could look at them. MM had refused to let anybody read what she had been writing but said yes to this guy for some reason then felt self-consious almost immediatley after he left and asked for them back the next day. He said he would never give them back and published them.",
            "Gone With The Wind (GWTW abbreviated for those who are hardcore fans) was a tremendously successful novel, earning its well-deserved title as an American literary masterpiece. Spun from the imagination and supposedly blurry, slightly realistic accounts of Margaret Mitchell and her friends (Mitchell said the characters were based on some of her acquiantances, as she grew up listening to Civil War accounts in the South), the novel took America by storm in the 30's. It was the Great Depression, a time that severely hurt the nation's economy. We were then a nation on the brink of war (sounds like our present time, does'nt it ?), World War II being just around the corner. Mitchell had written short novels that are unfortunately unknown to most readers and sold rarely in bookstores, but GWTW was her only great novel, her magnum opus, her legacy. She took it upon herself to write the great American novel, and she managed quite well. The novel deals with the life-altering Civil War, its effects principally on the main characters, a coquettish, strong-willed, male-manipulating survivor Southern belle, Scarlett O'Hara, an equally strong and slick man of ill-gotten means, Rhett Butler, Ashley Wilkes, of whom Scarlett is enamored and who is a reserved, elegant aristocrat and his wife Melanie Hamilton. The barrage of characters, from the Tarleton twins, to the comedic, gossipy Aunt Pittypat, to the slaves, including Mammy. The novel is very long, and of course, in order to truly enjoy the epic scope of the narrative, one must take time to read. A first read this novel in junior high, devouring every page, immersed in the tragedy and the triumphs that Scarlett faced during what must have been the hardest time for Americans in the nineteenth century. Similarily, the movie, in my opinion, related to the Americans of the 30's, having gone through the Depression, looking forward for resurrection and triumph despite all odds. As Scarlett's motto and unforgettable creed went, &quot;Tomorrow is another day.&quot; Themes of hope, nostalgia and unrequited love abound in this masterful story. I hope you read the novel if you have not and then view the film, rather than other way around. I saw the film first, then read the novel. You will find how DIFFERENT the book is from the movie, and how much more grandeur there is in the novel and how much more developed the characters are (i.e. Scarlett is supposed to have had children with her two husbands before her marriage to Butler). It was not difficul to imagine the characters in the novel looking and speaking as the actors did in the film - Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh, etc. But if you read closely, the characters are definately Southern, bourgeois, prudish, scandalous and quite Victorian in manners. Five stars for the great American novel, five stars for Margaret Mitchell. Gone With The Wind has stood the test of time.",
            "Okay. Raise your hands. How many have seen the movie but not read the book? Come on raise em! I thought so. I'm not taking anything away from the film. I love it, one of my favorites, watched it a gazillion times, but I just read the book for the 2nd time, the first time was, well long time ago. Even though I thought I knew the whole story, I realized there was so much more to the characters and the story.This tale of the South begins on the eve of the Civil War, and centers around a Southern belle, Scarlett O'Hara. Scarlett is a young Belle, with many beau. The young men are buzzing around her. She is the daughter of a wealthy plantation owner, she is spoiled,concieted, and shallow. Her sole purpose in life is to look good and catch a worthy husband.She has hope only for one though,Ashley Wilkes, who is bethrothed to Melanie Hamilton. Her whole life changes, as war breaks out, the Yankees are winning, many of her beau are dieing in the war. She is forced to do things,never in her life would she have thought she must. She must nurse the wounded, work her father's plantation, (as most of the slaves have been set free by the Yankees, or have just run off),she must care for her family, and save the faimly home from the Yankees. Even as the war ends, she still must continue to keep \"Tara\" (the family plantation) out of the hands of Carpetbaggers, and Scalliwags.Scarlett at her young and tender age will do whatever it takes to keep from going hungry and tattered like the rest of the southerners. This includes taking up with the likes of one Rhett Butler. Although the rest of Atlanta see's him as a low life friend to the Yankees, Scarlett see him as a means to end.He is rich, and like Scarlett doesnt really care what anyone else thinks. Rhett comes in and out of her life over the next several years always seeming to come to her resue, and they eventually marry, but not, according to Scarlett for love.Throughout the story we see Scarlett getting stronger with every tradgedy that besets her, and there are many. The loss of her parents, 2 husbands, a child, and of course the war. But what we also see is the loss of her youth and and the way of life she was born to have. In their place we see courage and tenacity,a woman who could run her own business (unheard of in those days), a woman who could shoulder anything that might come her way.It takes the death of Melanie for Scarlett to realize, what she already has in her life that is good. But is it too late?As I mentioned in the beginning, there is so much more in the book then you will see in the movie. There is a depth in some of the characters, like Melanie and Gerald O'hara(Scarlett's father), and more light is shed upon the relationship between the planatation owners and the slaves, we understand Scarlett,and her love for the land a little more, and see more to Rhett. There are other characters too, important to the lives of the main characters, Scarlett has two children besides Bonnie, there is a convict that has entered the lives of all, and the realtionship with Mammy is touched on more so than in the movie. Mrs. Mitchell never forgets to give us descriptions of the land,the war, and the people that will stick with you. We also get more of the history of the war and it's ravages on the South, the aftermath, the formation of \"The Klan\", and much more.Although we might disagree with the politics of the story, like how women were thought of, or the treatment of African American as slaves, Mrs. Mitchell paints us a clear vision of how things were. It was an era in American History that is, well, \"Gone With The Wind\"If you have never read this book or seen the movie, I tried only to give a taste of the story. I hope it has wet your appetite, read the book first, you won't be able to put it down.You will get lost in another time and place.If you have only seen the movie, this will fill in the blanks for you, and you can picture the faces and voices of the characters you know.Happy reading........Laurie P.S. There is also a wonderful sequel to the story calledScarlett: The Sequel to Margaret Mitchell's \"Gone With the Wind\", by Alexandra Ripley(see my review for book details)",
            "This is, beyond all doubt, the greatest novel of all time. It has everything: characters that leap off the pages, a thrillling plot, a powerful philosophy, and a universality that extends beyond the events it catalogues. This is an epic of mammoth proportions that tells not only one story but explores a whole way of living. I wept, cried, and laughed reading this book. This is more than a novel, it is a manual for living. This is not because the characters are perfect or even wholly admirable but because through their experiences we have the opportunity of seeing the world through a completely new lens. Add to this the fact that Scarlett and Rhett have one of the most exciting romances of all time and through this novel we literally have the opportunity to relive the passionate struggles of the Civil War. More than being a story about North and South, it is a story about rising out of the ashes of your own destruction and fighting on when all hope is gone. This is truly a novel that everyone should read. It made me a stronger person and taught me that no matter how bad things get, &quot;Tomorrow is another day.&quot;",
            "I still love it! and it is still remains my favorite novel. I read this as a teenager, and now again 30 years later. To me, it is one of those books that makes me sad for people who don't read, who miss out on the profound life altering and enjoyable experience that books can bring.After reading it again, later in life, I see that it was a book that could have been a huge influence to my early thinking. When I was in High School, early 70's, I was the only one of my friends and family who spoke out against racism... and in a time of racial riots, high emotion and tensions. Racism has always been a passionate issue for me...also woman's issues. The unfairness and stupidities, some blatantly obvious to me, and some not so obvious. Some discrimination I was unaware of for years, even though I looked for them, and was super sensitized to them. But we were all so brain washed, right from the cradle. It is still an evolving process of enlightenment, and will be for a long time to come. These issues have been such passionate issues for me... I now believe, after reading it again, that Gone With the Wind, has been one of those books, that did help inspire my thinking in those formative years. Margaret Mitchell was a great and courageous thinker....before her time. Her insights and knowledge on the Civil War in particular, were impressive for a woman of her times. Her thoughts of the motivations and impetuous behind wars, and the tearing down and building up of civilizations, is inspiring and thought provoking.In the character of Scarlet O'Hara, the rebellious, courageous, strong, engaging, not so sweet Southern bell, she wonderfully sheds light on the foolish traditions and conventions of society, particularly for the women in that unique disintegrating society of Southern Gentility. I think, the brilliance in the creation of that character and the story line allows her to get away with a very feminist and enlightened attitude, that I am sure was still very unpopular, but struggling to get free, in the 1920s and 30's.Also the ambiguities of racism, that existed in the North and the South, she subtly weaves in and about her story. All of it led me to wonder what the attitudes were in Margaret Mitchell's day, and what reading materials had shaped her thinking, during her life.To think that it was her first novel is mind boggling to me. Her thoughts and ideas are still timely today and indeed are timeless. I feel we missed out on some great works when she lost confidence in herself and refused to write again, then was killed so young. Maybe she just lost her heart and spirit, fighting to be herself in a hostile world toward women, and became a burnt out blazing star. I think she was someone I could've related to (not saying that I am a burnt out star LOL, maybe a burnt out light bulb LOL) I would have liked to have known her. She was an independent, rebellious spirit, intolerant of stupid ideas, conventions and traditions imposed by society, which only serves to keep certain segments of the population in control, of men and the wealthy.For a Southern Bell to have had such spirit, passion and intelligence, must have been very hard and lonely for Margaret Mitchell, during her lifetime. She was obviously a very thoughtful and well read person. She must have put up a good fight, I am sure, for her day and circumstances, she must have come up against a lot, and must've certainly been a very special person as well as gifted and talented.Through her skillfull and inspired writing, it was like she was actually there, a witness of the times.... maybe when she conceived the idea for the novel, or maybe, as a young child, civil war veterans could still have been alive and telling stories to her personally ... just think ... wow ... A great book, thought provoking, exciting, informative, and just plain good story telling. I could really imagine the feel and taste of the gritty dusty roads, smell the mud from the rain and the horse dung on the streets, I could imagine hunger, what hominy tastes like, what tight stays feel like, what an unwashed man smells like, I could imagine what the countryside, farms and cityscapes were like, the sounds, sights and smells. The whole experience inflamed my imagination and absorbed my mind.My only criticism of the book is that it could have been edited a little better, some areas were repetitive, but really it only adds to the charm of the book. If it was too perfect it would have been too sterile and may have missed some of the innocence of emotion that carried through. I am glad I read it again....Kathy Struewing",
            "This book is very good, and a page turner. Although many people say that the book is racist, and the author must be too, hardly anyone knows the truth about Margaret Mitchell. She started a program to help get African Americans into college, and that before her time, when there was still lots of prejudice going on. Yes it may sound like a sugar-coated world in GWTW, and it sort-of was back then, until the war hit. Also, you have to consider that the book is FICTION, while it is still historical fiction.",
            "This book is amazing!! For a 1,000 page read it just zipped by....the plot was interesting, the characters very well described. I finished the book and watched the movie the same night. Neither one was a disappointment!!",
            "One of my all time favorite books, one I have read several times. A true classic. It brings the South to life.",
            "Love the book I could not but it down - tried to download it on my kindle did not work will try again",
            "Read it first when I was 14 y.o. Still remember how I was bawling that Scarlett couldn't see how wonderful Rhett was and how much he loved her! :)Ah, one of the best books I've ever read!",
            "OMG. How can you review probably the classic of all books ever written? No one has ever duplicated this magnificent book. When I was in high school, I stayed up all night reading it for the first time. I can probably recite it from memory at this point because it required re-reading every couple of years!",
            "This book is a masterpiece of the Antebellem South and its decline and fall during the CivilWar.Its depiction of the character of Scarlett Ohara-its venality, greed and soulessness is a tour-de-force.",
            "Always loved this book ever since I was a teenager. I read this book in just a couple of days. Such a heartbreaking love story.",
            "I'm a big fan of the movie. Decided to rad on kindle (book is big so easier on kindle). So much better than the movie. I did have the movie characters in my head while I was reading, but that just made it do much more real. The movie is great, but the book is just so much better!",
            "Gone With the WindBy Margaret MitchellGone with the Wind was first published in May, 1936, and won the Pulitzer Prize in 1937; the novel linearly chronicles the enchanting and lyrical Old South, the brutal ravages of the Civil War upon the South and the subsequent struggle for reconstruction. Moreover, Gone With the Wind tells the tale of the strong-willed, crafty and determined, Katie \"Scarlett\" O'Hara; one of the most famous female characters in literature (and film - due to the 1939 movie of the same name).The book is a significant read, it was originally published at 1037 pages and now finishes at 1024. But it is well-worth the effort to pour your heart and time into this romantic, courageous and historical novel. If in doubt, consider the fact that it sold $176,000 copies within the first few weeks (at an unprecedented $3 apiece), and has gone on to sell over 30 million copies. Scarlett is considered by many to be the most intriguing female character ever written, and the novel typically tops the \"Most Romantic\" books lists. It took author, Margaret Mitchell, over seven years to write the story and it is the only book she ever published.The story is set in Atlanta, Georgia. Scarlett, the daughter of a wealthy Irish plantation owner, has made up her mind that she is in love with the charming and chivalrous Ashley Wilkes. However, Ashley has committed to marrying his gracious and even-tempered cousin, Melanie Hamilton. Their marriage puts high-minded Scarlett into a lifelong tailspin of ill-fated marriages and emotional conflict. In the meantime, she has the roguish, handsome and financially secure Rhett Butler in the wings for most of the story and eventually marries him but this proves equally tumultuous and ruinous for both of them.This is not a straight-forward love story; rather it is a assortment box of every type of human love imaginable. There is love for one's heritage (the Old South), land (the great Tara Plantation), children (she has four pregnancies), parents (who die), spouses (she has three) lovers, friends, and foes. This is also the story of strength, struggle, and self-realization. It is only at the end of the novel that Scarlett is finally able to distinguish and reconcile the difference between real love and starry-eyed infatuation.The spirited and intrepid Scarlett gives this epic novel wings to soar for over a thousand pages. She is a plucky character who approaches life with the resilience of a determined adventurer. Her intelligent, hard-working, go-getter attitude gives the story backbone, but it is her loves, longings and grievous losses that give it substance. Ultimately, it is her uncompromising ability to fight for herself, and for those she loves, that makes her the heroine of the novel and of the hearts of those who read it.Beth Walz[...]",
            "I loved all the nfo from the book that the movie couldn't give, it was a goo, but long read.",
            "When I was in middle school I shared my locker with my best friend. Her favorite movie and book were Gone With the Wind, we had posters in the locker and she talked about it non-stop. I looked at it, saw how long it was and laughed at her for her obccession.Now as a senior in college I decided to pick it up and see what all the fuss was about. I don't have a lot of time to read during the semester, but I had this book finished in less then 3 weeks. I didn't want to put it down, and it ate at me during classes to not know what was going on in Atlanta in my absence.This is quite possibly the most amazing book I have ever read. Mitchell's writting style is amazingly easy to read dispite the era she was writing during, and her descriptions make the state of Georgia come alive for a girl who has never left New England.The character of Scarlett both infuriated me and drew commanalities to myself. While sometimes you want to scream at the book and make her realize her love for Rhett hundreds of pages before she does, I think theres a little of every women in her. Her hopes and fears are still very real so many years later.I am so happy to have read this book, and now its one I'll reread in a few years. I highly reccamend it and am completely in love with it.",
            "I was 13 when I first read Gone with the Wind. It was a Chinese version. I couldn't remember who translated the book. All I could remember was that it was one of the most touching story I've ever read. I was encouraged by the Scarlett's passion and courage for life and touched by Rhett's patience and love.A few days ago, I picked up an English version of Gone of the Wind. It seems so much better than before. Maybe it's because that I'm now older and I can understand people's feelings in another dimension. Or maybe it's becuase I've moved to America and I had a better understanding of the western culture. I cried after reading it. I wish there was a different ending!",
            "What can I say about GWTW that hasn't already been said? The story is so captivating, and you can envision every scene because Margaret Mitchell describes every detail with such beautiful language. You really feel drawn back in time to the Old South and the Civil War. However, the characters are what really make the story so compelling, and the way they interact with each other is quite interesting because they are all so different. Scarlett O'Hara is probably one of the best literary characters ever created. She is very spoiled and self-centered, but I can't help but admire her strength and courage. There's also Rhett Butler, the handsome yet terribly scandalous man who loves Scarlett. Their relationship is definitely one of the greatest love stories ever written. You just have to read it! Don't be intimidated by the fact that it is over 1000 pages, the language is wonderful but not that complicated. If you haven't read this book, you're really missing out on a fantastic reading experience. Read it, and you will see why nearly seventy years after its initial publication, Gone With the Wind has not been forgotten.",
            "Just what the world needs. One more review of \"Gone With the Wind.\" I approached reading this book with a sense of trepidation. I looked at its 1,000+-page length, and doubted it was worth my time. I was afraid that it would be nothing more than an overblown historical romance novel. \"I'll think about it tomorrow\" summarizes the artistic merit of the book, I thought. Without the famous movie to sustain its reputation, who in their right mind would bother reading the book? Well, I was wrong. Looking beyond the soap opera of Scarlett, Rhett, and Ashley, I found things that really make this novel worthwhile. It's a richly detailed and historically accurate story of the Civil War and Reconstruction period, seen by those who bore the deprivations of daily life, not to mention the loss of loved ones. Although formatted as fiction, here we have living history. Margaret Mitchell draws deeply on her Georgia roots and gives the reader a uniquely Southern perspective of State Rights, slavery, Yankees, Carpetbaggers, Lincoln Republicans, and even the infamous Ku Klux Klan. Through the tribulations of Scarlett O'Hara, Mitchell argues that the Southern Cause appeared noble, but was ultimately foolish and futile. Above all, both Scarlett and Rhett Butler are practical people who doubt the sagacity of stifling social mores, and blind political affiliation. One can view Scarlett as the image of the South as she matures from a frivolous girl full of romantic notions into a strong, independent woman. Her pragmatism and steely resolve, forged on an anvil of personal suffering and survival, is another theme of the novel. It's easy to find the romantic melodrama of the surface plot distracting because it is fine entertainment. To enhance your reading pleasure, however, notice the rich historical detail and heed Scarlett's determination. As God is my witness, this is good reading. ;-)",
            "Going into this book, I was skeptical that I would enjoy it, as I am more into the Fantasy/Medievil genre. However, I don't know how anyone could not love this book. The characters are so real, the scenes so vividly described, and the feelings so profound that even I, someone not into the genre, couldn't get enough of it! Even though Scarlett was hostile towards loving Melanie, you couldn't help loving her! And I can actually see from the point of view of the Confederacy during the Civil War. It almost seems like their actions are justifiable, and we never learn this way of thinking in school! Over all, I have to say that Gone With the Wind lives up to it's reputation as one of the best novels of the 20th century!",
            "I first read this novel set during the Civil War when I was 12 years old. Shortly after that I was able to see the film version in an old downtown theater during one of its periodic rereleases. I was enthralled by both the novel and film. Is there anyone out there who doesn't know the plot? For the 10 people in the world who don't know, it features Scarlet O'Hara, a Southern belle, living that role to the hilt on her family's Southern, slave-worked plantation, when all hell breaks loose with the Civil War. Admirable for her survivor qualities, Scarlet is also manipulative and ruthless but meets her match in Rhett Butler, a Southerner who manages to move profitably among both sides of the War while most of the South is starving. I reread this novel as an adult, expecting that with my many more years of reading since that first read, that I would find the book over the top and soap opera like. It didn't happen. I couldn't put it down and had every bit as fascinating a time reading it again as I did the first time. If you haven't given it a reread in many a year, try it yourself and you'll be very pleasantly surprised.",
            "I have been reading &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; every couple of years since I was first &quot;allowed&quot; to read it at the age of 14! (In those days our mothers had higher hurdles for &quot;appropriate&quot; reading). When I was younger, I read this book once every year. I actually learned to read French without a dictionary by reading the French translation. (It's long enough to have that kind of linguistic influence! )The story of Scarlett O'Hara, a feisty and courageous southern &quot;belle&quot; whose beauty and sharpness was complicated by a lack of insight into human nature that ultimately left her unable to understand the hearts of those she most loved and by whom she was loved, until it was too late. It is also the story of the the South just before, during and after the Civil War.A more sympathetic portrait of the South than many other Civil war histories, it has aged fairly well, despite a slightly more patronistic view of African-Americans than one might be comfortable with today. Given its authorship dating back to the 1930s, I believe one needs to look at the book in the context of its historical period, and not to demean its historical or entertainment value simply because we are more aware and more sophisticated after the Era of Civil Rights in the United States. I also believe a sympathetic and well-educated person such as the author Margaret Mitchell seems to be, would have been the first to agree had she lived long enough to undergo that period of transformation in our country.Despite this limitation, few books of historical fiction are so well-plotted, and few characters in literature are so well-developed as that of Scarlett O'Hara, Rhett Butler, or Ashley and Melanie Wilkes--people I continue to feel like I &quot;knew&quot; in another time.The story is also that of Atlanta, a city which was relatively young and &quot;brash&quot; as a Confederate economic and cultural center, relative to Charleston and Richmond, the more sedate Confederate capitals.The book is valuable both as a historical text for those of us with little insight into the viewpoint of the South beyond that given in grade school textbooks, and as one of the most romantic dramas in American literature.I enjoyed reading this book as much at the age of 48 as I did almost 35 years ago (and many times in-between). I can't imagine a better summer read for a teenage girl, or a better way to relax at the beach for her mother, or a better way to pass a cold snowy vacation in front of a fire. Definetely a book for the romantically inclined.One should also note, that &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is one of the few books (until perhaps &quot;Cider House Rules&quot;) portrayed almost as well on film as the book is written. However the pleasures remain different and self-contained, and no enjoyment of either is lost by viewing or reading the other.",
            "This book is the best thing I've ever read in my life! The details are fantastic and the characters are well portrayed. The storyline is classic! This book immediately sucks you into the story and makes you really care about the characters in it. It made me laugh, it made me angry, it made me cry, and most of all it made my heart melt. I think this is the finest book ever written.",
            "Within the one thousand and twenty-four pages of this book, a reader is allowed to experience hardships, heartbreaks, shocking revalations, and most of all, an overwhelming emotionally-charged, intense book. This is one great book! Characters come alive, colors form before the eye of your imagination, shapes and sounds seem to ring in your ears, and undeniable passion sets fire to your heart. If you haven't read this experience of a lifetime, you are missing out on one of America's most treasured, true, and honest classics. (Those nights you will spend reading late into the hour and the tiredness of the next day are definatly worth it:)",
            "Reading Gone With The Wind is indeed an experience. It is able to change the opinion on romance stories for someone who does not like to read romance, it made me unable to put down the book even though I was busy.The story basically tells how the beautiful Southern belle Scarlett O Hara hardened during the American Civil War and her ruthless ways of making money even it means to marry someone whom she did not love as well as engaging the convicts to run the mills. The story also talks about the unusual love between Scarlett and Rhett Butler whom Scarlett hated intially and also the patriotism of the American Southerners. One could feel the different emotions of Human when reading the story such as jealousy, anger, honour between people and the country, love and so on. It is one unforgettable reading experience and Margaret Mitchell is indeed a talented writer whom I should say that it was regrettable that she was not the one who was writing the sequel to this story. Gone With The Wind is a highly recommended story.",
            "This classic story is classified as a Historical Fiction, but is a good review of the Civil War and about the early southern people of that century. I only wished I had paid more attention to my History Class as I found the story facinating. This is my third go around in reading Gone With the Wind. This time on my Kindle. It is one of the first books I have for my Kindle Library.",
            "If you've never read GWTW, put it next on your list!

Suddenly she finds herself doing the work formerly done by her slaves, delivering a baby, and having become a widow due to the War between the States. This is a story I have read 7 or 8 times in the past. This time I purchased it in large print for my 93-year old mother who wanted to read it again. I may need that large print myself before long!",
            "I bought this as a Christmas present for my mother. She has loved \"Gone With the Wind\" for decades, and I can remember sitting and watching it with her, when we only had one television. This particular book was nothing like the edition I bought her years ago, but it was lost in a long distance move, and I've never found another one like it. This copy takes it's place admirably.",
            "Definately not what I was expecting! I thought this would be one of those book where the characters fall head over heels in love. The romance was developed much more slowly, but was fitting with the plot.The novel is long, but very well-written. It will take you back to the late 19th century and give you a feel for what it was like to live in that time.I wasn't crazy about the ending, as I wished it would be happier, and left me wishing more had been written. I suppose the real ending was meant to be guessed.If you're looking for a good read and you don't mind if it takes some time, I would highly reccomend this book. Truly a classic!",
            "No, I had never read it. My knowledge of it came from the movie. A dear family member was re-reading it, and when I said I never had, she told me it was a must read. I didn't see why, but on her advice, I bought it and read, cover to cover. It is so much better than just the movie. The history of the South and the changes to life the war brought are incredible. Yes, I agree, it is a must read.",
            "First of all, the book is fantastic! Second of all, I could not ask for it to be in better condition! Even being shipped up to Alaska it came in great time and in great condition. I would recommend this book to everyone!",
            "I have read this book several times and it never dissappoints. The main characters; Scarlett, Rhett, Melanie, Ashley, Mammy along with others to numerous to mention are vivid in the minds eye. You are swept up by the turmoil the South suffered during the Civil War and Reconstruction. Ultimately, it is the love story of all time. A must read!",
            "This book is a true classic. The horrors of the civil war and learning how to live after the defeat and destruction of a culture have been brought to life in a spectacular way. Its unusual in the fact the main character is easy to dislike yet an honest look at flawed human character gains a respect for her. Almost every aspect of the human condition are encountered here within the pages. The movie version while enjoyable lacks the depth of characters and completely omits some characters. Highly recommended!",
            "A classic, I couldn't wait to download this to my Kindle. There is everything you could hope and dream of in this book. Scarlett is so complicated, yet real. My all time favorite book.",
            "The first time I read this Pulitzer winner was when I was in high school. The movie had just been re-released and my best friend and I saw it about 8 times. She still had the best plot description I've ever heard: \"This is the story of Rhett Butler who loves Scarlett O'Hara, who loves Ashley Wilkes, who loves Melanie Hamilton, who loves everyone, including the town tart Belle Watling, who loves Rhett Butler, who loves Scarlett...\"I've since read the book a second and now a third time and recognize more depth than our first summary. Yes, it is still a love story. But it is also a quintessential Southern book, a quintessential great American novel, a quintessential exploration of war and its aftermath, and a quintessential character study of Scarlett O'Hara's evolution from spoiled girl to unstoppable woman.Mitchell has crafted a 1000-page book that reads like a short novel. The characters who people her book present the full spectrum of human traits, from best to worst. These are the qualities that make the book such an enduring favorite, and really a classic work of literature.Is the book without flaws? Of course not. I cringe at the romantic version of the Ku Klux Klan. I am appalled at how often she compares the \"darkies\" to children or, worse yet, apes. But I am still caught up in the story, and that is the reason most people read novels - for a good story. And it was the story that first captured my attention and my heart, and it is the story that still earns it 5 stars.Linda Stephens does a fine job of narrating the audio version, though I thought her Scarlett sounded too mature at the beginning of the book - Scarlett is only 16 when we first meet her, and I thought her voice should have a higher pitch.",
            "Gone With the Wind is a classic novel of love and loss. Taking place in a time and place which is, quite literally, &quot;gone with the wind,&quot; it is interesting in both a historical sense and a romantic one. This novel is often called &quot;the greatest love story of all time,&quot; and truthfully at that. There is nothing quite as stirring as the interactions between Rhett and Scarlett. Margaret Mitchell's classic writing and understanding of times gone by makes this one of my (and the world's) ultimate favorites. At this point, this novel has reached so much fame that it is hardly necessary to discuss the plot, but for those uninformed out there, here it is:Scarlett O'Hara is the beautiful and headstrong eldest daughter of rich, high class plantation owners living just south of Atlanta during the antebellum period. Scarlett is the belle of the county - she has the smallest waist, the prettiest face, and the flirtiest personality. She could have any man, except the one she wants - Ashley Wilkes, who is already engaged to the frail but very sweet Melanie. When the Civil War breaks out everything changes. Scarlett marries, but is immediatly made a widow, and she moves to Atlanta to stay with Melanie. All the while Rhett Butler is lurking around. He's handsome, suave, and has a horrible reputation - hardly the kind of gentleman Scarlett was raised to like. But Scarlett, with her stubborn, headstrong attitude, brains, and independence is hardly a typical southern lady. As the war rages on, Scarlett's world is shattered and challenged. Wealth turns to poverty, pride to despair, admiration to dislike, and hate to love.Once started, this is a novel that cannot be put down. Many people read the whole thing (over 1,000 pages) in one very long sitting! That's what I did.",
            "I may just may be a 12-year-old girl, but when I read this book, I fell completely in love with it. I have the movie, an anthology and a paperback version that needs to be replaced after I find a hardcover version in stores. In a way it was better than the movie. It gave you a different idea about what Scarlett O'Hara was like and what she went through. It was and is just an excelent example of American history.",
            "I recieved Gone With the Wind as a Christmas gift and was not very excited about it. I had seen the movie and did not care for it, so I thought the book would problably be even worse--dragging on and on. I was so wrong. While not a quick read by any means, Gone With the Wind is completely fasinating. Everything about this book is perfect, from the characters to the events of the Civil War. Every character, especially the main characters, but even the minor characters, were wonderfully developed and real. I fell in love with each one. Scarlett and Rhett were written so honestly that, even in their wicked times, I could not help but love them. Melanie and Ashely as well were beautifully crafted. The story line is full of intimate, captivating details. Every scene is vital to the feel of the story and the final outcome. It has been several weeks since I finshed Gone With the Wind and I still find myself thinking about it and reliving it in my mind. There is a warning, however: When reading this book, do not read it from the the perspective of a person living in the 21st century. You must remember that our values have changed and, while definately for the better, the culture of Gone With the Wind should be judged on the basis of their own culture and morality, not our own. With that in mind, settle down for one of the most beautifully written and imaginatively creative books of our time.",
            "This book is just amazing. It is mind blowing. I loved it, I never wanted it to end. When I finally pulled myself away to eat or something I was dazed. I felt as though I were wearing glorious, beautiful dresses and corsets. The ending left me heartbroken. As fantastic and brilliant as this novel is, I both loved and hated the ending. It wasn't right as Scarlett and Rhett were made for eachother. So I read the sequal and although it could never match Maragret Mitchell, I was delighted to see Rhett and Scarlett together. It was though it had finally ended as I was far to curious and left hanging to leave it at the ending in Gone With The Wind. It is truly a masterpiece and I wish that Margaret had written the sequal, not alexandra and Margaret Mitchell was the only one who could really make the characters come alive as she did. I am only 15 but this novel makes the gentle, romantic days on the old South so appealing that I wish I knew what it was like to be there! For those who didn't like the sequal I find it hard to think that you didn't like the ending. It was just so hard to leave it with Rhett and Scarlett apart - him not loving her. Read Gone With the Wind than read the sequal Scarlett. Although Scarlett isn't great, it leaves you feeling pleased that they are together!",
            "I've read this book over and over again, and every time I finish I'm convinced that I'm never going to get tired of it. The story, although goes on forever (which think is okay, since I like to read, but many people I know complain abouth the lenght of the book) is so engrossing, so minutely descriptive and fascinating, even people who don't care for this kind of work will have at least to recognize the painstaking job of researching and piecing together the facts about American Southern life in the years of the Civil War. And the characters are something else. My absolute favorite literary heroine is Scarlett O'Hara, even if she was so stupid sometimes she made me desperate, and Rhett... well, sometimes I almost felt sorry for him, for all his macho-man behavior. Almost. You can't really feel sorry for a guy like this. And I loved the ending too, it was just right for the story. Anyway, I highly recommend this book to anyone, it deserves its reputation as a great classic, and by the way, so does the movie, even if it's not quite like the book, but that's to be expected, I guess.",
            "I have read Gone with the Wind in Chinese two times. I think that it is one of the best novels in the world. I was not only enjoying the beautiful language, but also learned the Civil War history. Magaret's characters showed me vivid and alive image. Especially Scarlett O'hara. Maybe, at the beginning of the book is not very interesting. But please continue you will find that you can not give it up. I love to talk about my feelings each time when I read it now. The first time I read it was in 1984. That time, I was a high school student, and reading famous novels was a popular thing to do. When my classmate and I met after summer vacation, they often asked me if I had read something interesting. I picked up Gone with the Wind. It is a huge novel, and there are too many foreigners. I couldn't remember all of the characters names. I couldn't figure out what happened. The only thing I could tell was that Scarlett was a very young girl and she loved to get the boys' attention. I just read one third of it because I was not interested in the love story. The second time that I read it was in 1991. I worked in a bank. My job was to count money. It was so boring when we had no money to count. So, I picked up the novel again. This time I could not give it up. Scarlett absorbed me. She was a spoiled, ruthless girl. She did everything she wanted to do and never thought about the consequences. I could see this from her first marriage. She didn't know if she really loved her husband. She already became Charles' widow and a boy's mother. During the civil war, Scarlett grew up. She had a very strong head. She was a brave lady. She saved her home from Sherman and the carpetbaggers. I think Scarlett was still too young to understand true love. Captain Butler said, &quot;I loved you but I couldn't let you know it. You're so brutal to those who love you, Scarlet. You take their love and hold it over their heads like a whip.&quot; When she recognized that she loved him so much too, it was already too late. Butler didn't trust her any more and didn't want to save his love with her. He left home. I cried for Scarlett. It was painful because their love story does not have a good end. But just because this end, Magaret moved thousands and thousands reader's hearts. I felt sadder than Scarlett did. I wouldn't know how to live without Butler's love. &quot;I'll think of it all tomorrow. After all, tomorrow is another day.&quot; Said Scarlett. That was Scarlett's way. I have learned a lot from her. I become brave and have a strong head after I read it. I can say Gone with the Wind is one of the best novels. It helps me have an excellent marriage. I think that young girls should read it and to learn be a brave and independent person. Finding true love and treating it as treasure is the effective method to have happy marriage.",
            "Scarlett is a complex woman...full of so many emotions that there is some of all of us in her. This book sets the plight of the Old South in an interesting fictional story...educating you without the feel of a textbook. You understand why the South tried like mad to hold onto its clearly outdated values and traditions. The struggle of the South becomes Scarlett's struggle with herself and the changing world around her. Then when you add Rhett Butler into the mix, off go the fireworks! This is truly a book that you have to read to appreciate. I don't enjoy romance novels or fiction that is too fluffy and this book has sometimes had those reputations. Not so...this book will grab you and never let you go.",
            "My mother is a huge fan of Gone With The Wind and for years she tried to get me to read it but I wouldn't because it's not the kind of thing I usually read. However, I finally read it when I was about 15 and I couldn't believe what I had been missing out on! Since then I have read it about a million times! The thing that makes Gone With the Wind so much better than your average romance is the wonderfully realistic characters. Considering she is the heroine Scarlett is not the nicest person in the world but that is what makes her so likeable! The same applies to Rhett Butler, who you can't help falling in love with even though he's not real! The book is sad, exciting and informative all at once and I can honestly say it is the best book I have ever read!!! The sequel &quot;Scarlett&quot; is almost as good in my opinion, though once you have read it, the ending to Gone With The Wind is spoiled. Anyway, if you haven't read either of these books yet, I recommend you read them now or you'll regret it like I did!",
            "I started to read this book as a challenge - to see if I could actually finish it. I did, finally, (after about a month) and was really impressed. Actually, I was quite sad at the end of the last paragraph. It was definetly a classic book, but I don't intend on reading it again anytime in the near future.Scarlett O'Hara is a great character. Though bull-headed, nasty, and insensitive, she comes off as a believeable southern woman post-Civil War. She apparantly has no feelings whatsoever for those who care for her most, that is, she doesn't find out how much people mean to her until the very last chapter of the book. Still, she is strong, stubborn, can be sweet, and can get whatever she wants. And yes, she is a believeable character. I simply can not stand people who use the excuse that the character was unbelieveable. How is that? By saying that, you're saying that there could'nt be anyone in the world with the same qualities as that person? I don't think so.The only thing that bothered me about this was the fact that Scarlett didn't give a rat's a** about her children. Much to the point where they were afraid of her. That fact just might make some people hate her.But, all other matters aside, I don't think I can express enough how much I loved this book. It was beautifully written, with the right word choice (they would talk in big words all the time, so I was thankful that I could actually understand them!) and such. I know some people hated this book, but that's their opinion. I don't know why there is even such a thing as reviews. You just have to read the book for yourself and don't trust what anyone else says. And don't spend all your time going into such detail about the plot. That thing with Rhett's mentioned but not explained son really has no relevance to the plot. If you spend all your time looking at the downsides of the story, you'll never enjoy it. But, I do hope that you enjoy this book, because I think it it really great.",
            "GWTW was the very best. I always thought that there was no way that a book could really touch me, emotionally I mean. This was the only book that could accomplish that. Magaret Mitchell did a superb job writing this book, and I think that there never should have been a sequel written, for no continuation of the story could match the excellency of GWTW. I felt that the book ended well, and that if it had ended as a 'happily ever after' sort of thing, it wouldn't have been believable at all. Although I was crying at the end, I do believe it turned out correctly. I could not put it down! GWTW is timeless, and applies to everyone, so I recommend this book to every single person out there. Everyone can relate to the charecters in this book. A true classic, you've gotta read Gone With the Wind. I doubt I will ever find a book that can compare with the quality of it! Read it. PLEASE! We can all learn a lesson from the charecters in the book, especially Scarlett O'hara. A must read!",
            "This is just such an enjoyable read. Scarlett is appropriately evil, and in the end redeemable.Wonderful novel. I intend to read this again very soon. I had not realized how much better the book is than the movie!",
            "One of my library students finally finished \"Gone With the Wind.\" She's my voracious reader, whom I allow to check out four, six books at a time. If anyone asks why she gets to check out that many books, she is to say: \"Because I'm special.\" It took her two years to read GWTW: she began it in the sixth grade, let it languish, then this year, as an 8th grader, she started over and read it through. Oh! Yes, she loved it!I first read the 1,037-page novel in the 8th grade as well. That was my first reading. I was severely disappointed with the ending. So I read it again and again, fully expecting each time that Rhett WOULD \"give a damn\" and return to Scarlet. This was not to be, at least, not in the annals of concluded fiction. Who hasn't read GWTW that didn't imagine Rhett returning?Just as in real life, fictional characters also behave according to their dictates (granted, their god is different from those of humans) and their circumstances. Would any self-respecting Rhett return to such a cold-hearted, well, you know how she acts and what she is. Even red-petticoat wearing Mammy scoffed at the idea of Scarlet actually winning either man: book-loving, milquetoast Ashley or hot-blooded, fiercely protective Rhett. One is too tame, the other too untameable.So, what is GWTW really: an historical novel of the South and its Lost Cause or a microscopic look at one woman and how she is both damaged and strenghtned by the War Between the States, which meant nothing more to her than an inconvenience. Is it both?Gone With the Wind, is, of course, both historical and character-driven. Two protagonists, Scarlet and Rhett, are pitted against each other, although both are attracted to each other, whether one knows it or not. Ashley is an unattainable dream, a wish fulfillment; Rhett is a hot rod used to prod Scarlet's sensibilities (which are not so sensible).Of course, the real heroine of the novel is Melanie, sweet, sweet Melanie, symbolic steel magnolia, who can kill an enemy in cold blood, yet defend her most erring sister-in-law. Loyal, devout, faithful, responsible, just keep on naming those lovely positive character attributes and you have Melanie. Does such a woman exist? Of course, she does. You and I both know women like Melanie. They run the churches--behind the scenes unless they're needed up front. Always there, always dependable, yet just a little sicky sweet.Scarlet. To the end, defiant. To the end, hoping for that rescue. To the end, just Scarlett. Oh well, we'll think about it tomorrow. Yes, tomorrow.",
            "A true American classic, Gone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell is a must read for anyone who likes a good story about survival, betrayal, love, and historical fiction. Set in the Old South before, during, and after the Civil War, Scarlett O'Hara must grow up, leave her comfort zone and survive numerous hardships. Although the movie has caught the essence of the book, actually reading this novel is a must for every independent woman in America.",
            "I first read Gone with the Wind when I was in high school. I was 16 and didn't care much about anything, but this book grabbed my attention and held it. I had grown up in an old and established family from the South and had heard all the tales of the horrors of the 'time of our most recent unpleasantness', but Margret Michell's book brought those times to life. Yes, I know what people say about Mitchell and this book, but what was is. You can't change history just because you don't like it. I didn't and don't like a lot of my ancestor's choices, either, but it's there just the same.Anyhow, from the journals I've read (and I've now read lots of them) and my own personal history passed down from word of mouth, I think Ms. Mitchell did a good job of capturing a bygone era. In a word, I'm as captivated by this book in my older years as I was at 16. The book lives.",
            "There are good reasons why Gone With The Wind, published 73 years ago, is a classic among classics, a Pulitzer Prize winner, and has sold over 28 million copies in more than 37 countries. The reasons are that it is an unparalleled monumental epic of the American South that is very rich in historical facts, it has superbly developed unforgettable characters, a narrarative that is so captivating that the reader will feel he/she is right there experiencing all that was going on, and it truly stands the test of time. I enjoyed reading it at least as much now (and possibly more) than when I first read it over 45 years ago. While Gone With The Wind is often marketed as \"the greatest love story of our time,\" it is so much more than that. If you haven't read Gone With The Wind or haven't done so in many years, do yourself a tremendous favor and read it/read it again as soon as possible. It's an experience you'll savor for years to come.",
            "I can understand why Gone with the wind has been considered as a classic. This is Margaret Mitchelle's unforgettable tale of love and hate, gain and lost, life and death, of a nation divided, of the American people being torn apart by the civil war. This is the story of honourable but weak Ashley Wilkes, who lives in his own world, of Melanie Wilkes, who is no less than an angel, of the Fontaines, the Tarletons, the O'Haras and many other Geogians. This is the story of the black and white Southerners before, during, and after the war. Above all, it is the story of Captain Rhett Butler and the beautiful, determined, strong-willed but ignorant and ruthless Scarlett O'Hara.Gone with the wind is an outstanding read!",
            "Five stars is not enough to rate this timeless, flawless epic novel of the South. Miss Mitchell's talent has never been underrated or under-appreciated, but having read it as a teen - then, again recently, after having read \"Rhett Butler's People,\" the authorized sequel to GWTW commissioned by the Mitchell estate, I am newly appreciative of Miss Mitchell's prodigious talent.For those who have only seen the equally terrific, but different, movie, please read Mitchell's original.The movie does stand on its own. I am a fan of novels-turned-books and have seen many. I never denigrate a movie if it differed from the original novel in any way. The two are different media.But Mitchell's only novel earned her a place forever in American literature and is desrving to be read in its entirety.Though long, it is a quick read for the engaged reader.I have not read the much-ballyhooed but often best-seller, unauthorized sequels, but I will do so, mostly out of curiosity.The authorized sequel, Rhett Butler's People, is also interesting, but can never live up to Mitchell's GWTW.",
            "I read this book as a teenager and have absolutely loved it ever since. The descriptive quality of writing that Margaret Mitchell utilizes brings the story and its characters to life. It gives an good glimpse of the state of affairs in the antebellum and postbellum South.I've read this on several occasions, and each time I get just as much enjoyment as I did the first! Excellent!",
            "Gone with the Wind is one of the rare stories that delivers exactly what you wouldn't expect. Nothing about it is predictable, nothing is cliche. The heroine is infintely less of a heroine than ever before - she's Scarlett, the spoiled, selfish Southern daughter of a plantation owner, used to having everything handed to her on a silver platter. During the period of the Civil War, she is forced to grow up and become a woman, but she never loses childish inclinations to selfishness and pettiness.Enter Rhett Butler, the conceited, vulgar 'Yankee' whom Scarlett despises and yet, is fascinated by. Though he is not quite a hero as Scarlett is not a heroine, he has become one of America's most beloved leading men.Gone with the Wind is startling in its storyline and realism, and does not gloss over the brutality and harsh outcomings of the Civil War - on both sides.I purchased my copy of Gone with the Wind at a library. The book had not been used by the library, but donated and then put for sale. I paid $3 for it - in very good condition. It was a 40th Anniversary Edition complete with slipcase. It is positively beautiful, and I could not have gotten a better bargain. Aside from some mild use and wear, and a name written in pencil on the first page, its in perfect condition. An excellent copy - I read it over and over.",
            "Love in the time of war! You can't beat it. The first time I read this book I was interested in the love story. When I read it again, I was mesmerized with the portrait of a time and place which have been erased from our collection memory by layers of political correctness. This paperback edition is lovely, by the way, and it doesn't break apart the way some big paperbacks can.",
            "First I fell in love with the movie,then I read the book.The edition I have was my moms from the 1930's so i think its an original copy.This story is more than a love story. It is a study in human nature from Scarlets temper tantrums to Rhetts deep devoted love of Scarlet so much so that he has to leave her for his own good.This is undoubtly the best book ever written and by a newcomer at that. Margaret Mitchell outdid herself on this one.",
            "I was twelve years old when I first read this book and fell in love with Scarlett, Rhett, and the Old South. Now, 20 years later, I work in a bookstore and I still recommend this book to customers all the time. When people tell me that they have seen the movie, and therefore don't feel they need to read the book, I always strongly disagree with them. The book is so much better than the movie, and I'm sure I'll be recommending it to people for many years to come.",
            "One of the icons of American Literature and deservedly so.First read this when I was a teenager and my friends and I would ooh and aah over the scene near the beginning where Scarlett was trying to decide what to wear to the party at Ashley's plantation.I read it every couple of years thereafter and as I grew and matured so did my appreciation of this magnificent book. I first became more aware of how detailed Mitchell's research about the Civil War must have been (no matter how biased she was) and this prompted me to read more books both fiction and non-fiction about that period.My next level of maturity was demonstrated by subsequent reads where I became more impressed with Mitchell's willingness to avoid a standard HEA. She never painted Scarlett as anything but what the character demanded: a spoiled debutante whose world had not only collapsed but was blown away forever by the \"wind\". Scarlett's true, unvarnished, bottom line goal in life became to ensure that she and her family would survive and so would that representation of survival - Tara. Compared to the mores of that lost civilization, she seemed to have fallen from grace. In reality, she, being so very young, came to understand which of the values and mores of that civilization were worth keeping and what were just superficial and ignorant societal expectations. Unfortunately, she didn't realize this in time to obtain the greatest of those worthwhile values - true and reciprocated love. However, she did get what she needed and was looking toward the future with her trademark confidence and assurance.Just a fabulous, fabulous book.",
            "I had borrowed the audio from my local library, and after both realizing I wouldn't finish it in time, and that it was so very good I wanted to share it, I bought it. The narration is superb, and adds much to the story. After moving to Atlanta from Wisconsin I am familiar with many of the locations mentioned in the story. I also have begun to understand some of the old family Atlantans' feelings about what happened to their society.",
            "I cried when I finished this book. I honestly did. No, it was not the heart-breaking ending that brought me to tears, but the fact that there was no more Gone with the Wind. The book brought me so much into its depths, made me so much a part of its words, that at the end I felt almost as if a friend died. I just wish that Margaret Mitchell were alive so that I could talk to her, understand the mind that created such a masterpiece. I will never read a better book.",
            "Okay, everyone has been saying that this book is insulting, that it's racist, etc.Yes, it is extremely racist. Slavery is one of the most horrible inventions of the world. When slavery became race-oriented, it got even worse.But everyone really needs to take GWTW in perspective. First of all, the African-American slavery was hugely propagandized by the North U.S. There were a lot less beatings and brandings than is commonly perceived. The real horror of slavery was the psychological effect. Imagine that you've been told all your life that you are worthless, and fit only to be a slave. Wouldn't you conduct yourself in that way? That was the true horror of slavery. The reason that there were few beatings and brandings was even more horrible. It was because slaves were considered to be valuable property, and the plantation owners would as soon whip their valuable horses to death as whip their valuable slaves. The Northerners really didn't need to exaggerate bloodhounds and whippings; these stories are enough to get the North into a patriotic fervor. So GWTW, although ridiculously romanticized when it comes to slavery, is not completely incorrect. But it does fail to take into account the psychological effects that I just mentioned. It also fails the characterize the black characters in the narrative.Despite all these faults, GWTW is not meant to cater to modern views or even what we would call \"just\" views. It is meant to depict the Southern attitude at the time of the Civil War and the Reconstruction. Obviously, since everyone is incredibly incensed about its attitude, it succeeds remarkably well.Second of all, the movie romaticizes the already romantic book. Mitchell did not portray the rich plantationers in GWTW, she portrayed the middle-class, uneducated pioneers, with the exception of the Wilkes family. They were not contemptuous towards Crackers and poor whites because they were only a step and some luck above them. Essentially they had started out in their position. Gerald O'Hara is harldy anyone's estimation of the typical rich, supercilious, high-class planter. There weren't any stereotypical planters in Georgia, anyway, not before or after the Civil War. It was more a homesteading state than a Kentucky.So, overall, GWTW did exactly what it set out to do. And yes, it really neglects the black psychological view and focuses mainly on Scarlett's and Rhett's, with a couple of other characters. But this is also in character of the time. If anyone really wants to read a clarifying book about GWTW, read Southern Daughter. It ought to help with the rather confused opinions being circulated about GWTW.",
            "This has to be the best book ever written. Scarlett, Rhett, Melanie, and Ashley were brought to life within those 1,024 pages. You felt there sorrows, joys, worries, and loves. I loved Rhett, he was such a character! Melanie is larger than life, and too good for Scarlett. As long as she had Ashley, she was unaffected by the war. Ashley was a gentleman in an era he did not belong in. He was simply an ornament not a laborer. Rhett was everything a character could be, (not to mention very dashing.) Scarlett is probably the only character that you love one chapter and hate the next. She had a very strong will to survive and a lot of selfishness. She was strong enough to survive the war, but she was not as strong as Melanie, (mentally.) My very favorite characters were the Tarleton twins, espically Brent. I do think Melanie was not very strong (physically) but she made up for it with her huge heart, you would have to have one to always stand up for Scarlett. My favorite part of the book is when Scarlett and Rhett are on their honeymoon. They were really, truly in love then. I would think Scarlett would love Rhett long before she did. He was so kind and loving to Bonnie. I think Rhett really did love her the whole time, and he really would not leave her. Why didn't Scarlett marry Stuart? The book would be very different, but Scarlett loved him. GREAT BOOK!",
            "Oh my god!!! i just fifnished GWTW like an hour ago and i still keep bursting into tears. is that normal? maybe for other people but not for me.

            "I thought it was well written but rather lenghtly. The author has an excellent vocabulary. I'm reading it again. The story came alive for me.",
            "Gone with the Wind is a classic I read during my teenage years yet I had to purchase it in physical form since when I read it I had burrowed it from a library. For all of you who have not read this novel, it is a historical fiction romance novel about a girl who had it all, lost it all and had to learn to stop being so vain. It is a story that will never come out of the line of favorite books to read so one must read it at least one in our lifetime!",
            "Hey Everyone! I absolutely LOVE this book. Everybody thought that I was crazy because I am 11 years old and I read a book with over 1,000 pages. But the book turned out to be wonderful! I would recommend it to everybody. The tale of Scarlett O'Hara stole my heart. Margaret Mitchell is a wonderful author and a great story teller. Everybody has to read this stupendous novel at least one time in their life!",
            "I never thought a book good be so beautiful, so wonderful, good enough to eat. I saw the movie in 3rd grade and fell in love with it. I decided to go to my school library and pick up a copy of the book. I started reading and even the librarian couldnt believe that such a young child, with such an adult book.My teacher, and class mates, IMPRESSED! For me, I never wanted to stop. From Twelve Oaks to Tara, the thrill never ends. So I finished it with partly understanding but then re-read it in sixth grade. The words that were chosen to make this book, is truly amazing. I have to hand it to your Margaret Mitchell, for creating the best book that America will ever know. Because with all of the books I have read and with all of the books I am going to read, I know there is nothing like, \"Gone with The Wind.\" \"Frankly My dear...there is nothing like it!\" So I am suggesting you start reading it soon, because if you dont have time to day, dont worry . . . \"Because tomorrow is another day,\"",
            "The many adventures of a spoiled, vain, and annoying adolescent living in Georgia during the Civil War era. I read this book at least once yearly just for the mental time travel. Boy, could Margaret Mitchell paint a picture! I always feel as though I'm right on Peachtree Street with Scarlett O'Hara, and I never fail to get mad at her for losing Rhett. Everyone should try this at least once.",
            "Scarlett O' Hara has to be the most famous character ever written in all of literature. Her story about coming to age just when the Civil War began and having to learn everything she was taught is of no use to her during war and after war is a must read for anyone. Her transformation into a shrewd, lying and spoiled southern belle is just about the best for any reader who loves stories based on the southern way of life. I just have to say this book is not racist and it was never intended to be. Many people just think it is because now we are bombarded into thinking blacks are the victims of society due to them having been slaves. People this is the story of Scarlett O'Hara living in times when not many black people were educated. Some blacks were but many were not as the belief back then was that blacks were just not too smart to learn. Which we now know is not true. But one thing is true and what many of us now have to understand is that many blacks who were slaves did not want to be freed. Where were they going to go and what were they going to do after being free? What did they know about this strange land being freed? How were they going to survive? They didn't know and they didn't know anything about taking the intiative of oneself instead of being told what to do. And many blacks were defending the then southern way of living. Many slaves did love there slaveowners and wanted to remain with them. Many slaves did fight on the Confederate side willingly. Even when the south did lose the war many ex-slaves did stay with they're ex-slave owners because in they're way of thinking they still belonged to them. It was a mutual love. They did die fighting believing in the Confederate way of thinking. They were not brainwashed it was just they way of living that they knew. They loved there white folk like many Mammies did love there white kids as if they were they're own children. We have to remember that the way of thinking was completely different back then. We have to remember if that way of thinking was now we would think the same way. Love knows no barriers. The love of another to another is just that. Even if it meant a slave-owner loving his slave like a slave loved his owner. Didn't God have a commandment to treat your slave with respect and to give him his seventh year free. The bad people of this story were the carpetbaggers. They caused so much damage in this country back then that the states suffered it for years because of them. They lied to the ex-slaves by telling them to vote them into office and then wanting to have nothing to do with them. As Margaret Mitchell tells in the book many blacks were put into also. I read many books about this subject and it is true. The most ignorant and hateful towards white were put into office. They saw this as a way to get back at the whites for having them in slavery. But that is not it. Many slaves saw it as revenge because of the wrong done unto them by being slaves. What the carpetbaggers did was poison the minds of the ex-slaves by telling them it was wrong and it was wrong but they made them hate the whites by telling lies about how many whites ex-slaveowners beat, torture, and rape and commit atrocities against the blacks. Okay yes it did happen. But like many stories it was embellished. Only about a one percent of the whites did own plantations. Something we dont't believe but it is true. We have been taught that all whites back then were rich and made they're riches on the backs of blacks. That's not true. If it was then there would be more blacks in this country then there are whites. WE as a people of this time know our TIME only, meaning now or present time. We are a product of the liberal public education system. I mean we don't know our history or any other countries either. We love to embellish the past, everybody now who was of voting age swear up and down that they voted for Kennedy when he was running for the presidency. That is a complete lie. So everybody who now who is black (this is excluding the newly arrived black Africans) swear up and down they came from slaves. That is a lie also. Many black families immigrated into the US after the Civil War and after the nineteen hundreds. So many black people can't say they came from slaves. What I am saying is that the Jessie Jacksons and Al Sharptons of this world have poisoned many black people of this country to the point of wanting to hurt them and keep them enslaved in hatred towards the whites of this country. We should remember the civil war but not be embittered by it.",
            "What is the point of reviewing this book? Everyone knows that it is amazing - the movie won many Oscars and got 5 stars, a rare rating for a movie. I read this 1024 page-turner in about 1 month. It takes a little while to get into the story, but not long. Scarlett's character does get a little frustrating at times, you just want to yell at her so she understands!! But that's what makes this book a definite classic. There shouldn't be anybody in the world without this book on their bookshelves, and I mean anybody. And what is even better is owning an older version, or even a first edition! This book makes you want to know everything about it: the movie, the author, a sequel!! Speaking of that, there is &quot;Scarlett: The Sequel to Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind&quot; by Alexandra Ripley. I would definitely recommend that also, I'm about half way through it. Though the author is different, you get into her style quickly and fall back into the romance of Scarlett and Rhett. I would suggest saving the movie (if you haven't seen it) for after reading the book. A great summer read. Worth the $6!!!",
            "This is without a doubt the best book in the world! I loved the way Margret Mitchell made the charecters so realistic. If you don't read this book you will be missing out on alot. The ending however is heartbreaking. I have read this book a dozen times and it never gets boring. I love the witty remarks of Rhett. This is a book you don't want to miss out on.",
            "It was amazing to me how much I could love a book with so few admirable characters. (One wonders if the film, &quot;The War of the Roses&quot; might not have been contrived from the story of Rhett and Scarlett.) But in all of her rage, Scarlett's stength and determination still makes her an attractive character, and after all of her shenanigans, you still want her to win. When assessing the characters, it is important to remember that they lived in a society where they played by different rules, often rules difficult for us to understand (e.g. rules regarding what constitutes adultery; and unbending rules of loyalty that might otherwise escape many of us). But all in all, beauty seems only to be found in Melanie and Mammy; a pitiful sympathy for Ashley and the other fallen &quot;Old Guard&quot;; and a most certain feeling that, indeed, Scarlett and Rhett, deserved each other, pain and all.",
            "I always thought &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; would forever hold the title.But &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; may surpass it.As a damn yankee,I discovered I belong south of the Mason-Dixon line,where women are treated respectfully,parents are honored,loyalty to family and friends are boundless,and others postive traits exhibited,that are much too scarce today.Read this book and also find yourself wishing to protect and risk your life for Scarlett!",
            "I grew up watching the movie version of Gone With the Wind, and I first read the novel when I was in 9th grade. If you only see the movie, you miss out on so much. This story literally has a little of everything in it. Don't let the length scare you away-it is such an amazing book, don't miss out on it!",
            "This novel is acknowledged as one of, if not the best and most popular novels ever written. It deserves just that because of the universal appeal of its themes. The story starts with Scarlett O'Hara, a charming, determined but stubborn and proud Southern belle, trying to get the heart of Ashley Wilkes, who is to marry all-so-sweet and kind Melly, heartily hated by the leading lady. After over 1000 pages it ends with Scarlett realization that she really loves charming not such a gentleman Rhett Butler, who is also very proud and stubborn.In between the first and the last pages there are 12 years of Scarlett's life, from 16 to 28, Civil War, 3 marriages (the last of them is with Rhett Butler), 3 kids, wealth, poverty, and then wealth again, unseen love of Rhett Butler, death of all beloved, her maturity from a child into a woman, and finally the realization of the true priorities in her life. Unfortunately it is too late, they are all gone with the wind...",
            "I first read GONE WITH THE WIND many years ago. I read it again every few years. Why not? In spite of the long list of criticisms (melodramatic, insensitive, sexist, racist, materialism, soap opera, etc.) it is undeniably magnificent. Writers, this is a great book to read backwards---last chapter, then forward, chapter by chapter. You will learn a lot about writing if you do this.",
            "This novel is, I'm certain you must know by now, a family saga covering the Civil War and Reconstruction in the South from the viewpoint of a wealthy Southern family who live on a plantation called 'Tara.'Easy to read, 'Gone With the Wind' is not only a family saga, but a fascinating character study of people who did what they had to do in order to survive the devastating war years and the reconstruction that followed. Lives and lifestyles were changed forever with the Civil War. Southerners had to adapt to an entirely foreign way of life and this novel explores how different people coped in the form of well-developed, complex characters.Difficult to put down, this novel is one you will read over and over again and eventually pass down to your children. Don't hesitate to buy a copy!",
            "This book probably has more reviews written for it than any other that I've seen on the Amazon site. As I said, I don't know what I can add that others haven't already said...but I have often thought, as I have read and re-read this wonderful novel, that I don't think Scarlett would get Rhett back in the end. I always thought Rhett was far more intelligent, well-rounded, and wise than she, and that an awful lot of his longing for her was comprised of her lack of availability (her heart, that is, that heart that belonged only to Ashley), and her looks. After all, when did he fall for her? When he looked up at her on the staircase and she was wearing that low-cut green-sprigged dress!The fascinating characters that Mitchell so deftly brings to life are what make this novel so unforgettable. I don't know that any of them are truly believable, but somehow that doesn't matter. The writing style is dated (all those exclamation points!), and of course the dialect and political viewpoints are atrocious in this day and age. The amazing thing is that none of this matters as we find ourselves caught up in Scarlett's world, a world, as Mitchell so poignantly writes,that was gone with the wind.When Rhett tells Scarlett at the end, \"I won't be pursued as the luckless Ashley was pursued,\" I believe he meant it. The fact that he could coin a phrase like, \"Someone or something has convinced you that your lover is too large a piece of Dead Sea fruit for even you to chew\" (not sure if I'm quoting this 100% correctly, but I've memorized large portions of the dialogue through re-reading) simply showcases how much more extensive his intellect is than Scarlett's. He realizes now that she no longer holds any appeal for him; her charm for him, simply, was her unattainable-ness. (not a word, either - sorry!)I never read the sequel. To me, that would be a sacrilege. Mitchell always said that for her, the novel ended when it ended. But no one who reads it can resist pondering...\"Did she get him back?\" And I say no.But read it anyway. It's a long read, but oh, such an enjoyable one.",
            "This book is now my favorite book of all time (it contends with the Bible people!) and is the reason I am grateful to have sight and the ability to read, to enjoy masterpieces like this. I will admit the first 100 pages were slightly slow, but necessary to build the story. I loved learning more about the Civil War and appreciated seeing it from a perspective that often gets shrouded in history. Slavery was never ok but this book allowed me to explore slavery from the South's point of view. I also loved Scarlet, even with all her downfalls, and enjoyed the book most all when Rhett was highlighted.Every American should be required to read this book! That is how passionately I loved it.Also, the un-sequel Scarlet was a lovely read. Some contest that Mitchell's work should have been left alone and I can see their point. However, I wasn't ready to say good-bye to Scarlet just yet. No, the sequel does not quite compare to the original, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend the sequel to those who secretly want a happier ending for Scarlet.",
            "GWTW-I discovered it on the shelf of my highschool library & having never heard of it, I decided I would read it. I was completely unprepared for the ride! While we all want to be Melanie, the truth is-we're all a little Scarlett on the inside! I have since read the book many times (and of course own the DVD) and never tire of it. A definite book for gals-you get a glimpse into southern life at the time of the Civil War and experience a love story of enormous preportions. \"Fiddle Dee Dee\" is our catch phrase around the house! LOVED IT>",
            "Do yourself a favor and order Gone with the Wind now. Just make sure you have a lot of time to devote to this book, because once you start reading it, you won't be able to stop. Margaret Mitchell's classic is a fantastic, almost hypnotizing read and Scarlett O'Hara is one of the best --if not the best-- characters in American fiction of all time.",
            "well, english is not my mother tongue but I speak it well enough to love this book. Maybe I'm not completely objective since I have seen the movie for about 10 time before I had read the book (this means I'm crazy about the movie) but still some things are slightely different then they are portrayed in the movie. First of all, there are a lot of characters that the film does not mention (which are quite important, but still, does not change the point) and the book is a lot more unfair I might say, to the slaves (only after reading I realized why there are, if any, contoversies surrounding GWTW phenomenon). They are often portrayed as silly, not so bright people (although very, very lovely and loving) and in the movie they are very smart, prudent people that often help when white people couldn't, that often show more courage and intelligence then the wihite people do and that's why I like them better portrayed in the film. But the things why I absolutely love GWTW, love between Rhett and Scarlett and deep friendship between Scarlett and Melanie, stay the same. So, all in all, I truly recommend this book first of all, to all the GWTW fans (because they CAN'T go wrong with reading it) and then to all the others who'd like to find out thing or two about how things were back in the old South, meet really great characters that are above all, believable and convincing and read about the greatest love story of our time, as it's been said on the covers.",
            "I loved this book but the end reduced me to tears. And Rhett ,Rhetts character made me love him literally love him like Scarlett did lin the end. When I was reading this book I felt like I was Scarlett and when he said he did not love her I felt like he was saying that to me . I'm sad that Margaret Mitchell died before she could make the sequel because I fell in love with Rhett ! My heart is empty right now . Oh Rhett ! By: Heart Broken",
            "Amazing peice of work, and should be read by everyone. This is the best written novel I have ever read, and probably will be the ebst written novel I will ever read in my lifespan. This book has so much detail, the way the characters are described are almost impossible to compare to any book written. Not only is this an epic, but I find it to be a historical epic; it navigates through the years, when the civil war started (or months before it began), through the civil war, the end and the reconstruction. The reconstruction is something that is not ever really written about, and the novel actually depicts what the south is going through after the civil war.Some people might find Scarlett, to be selfish and well...a bitch. But I loved her! Wither her the entire story wouldn't work! I found her love over ashley to be rather mezmerizing, who would spend years after someone, and into three marriages?Scarlett! I thought the most detailed part, were the settings especially rhett's and Scarlett's dream home, talk about having a nice mansion!",
            "Gone with the Wind is an epic tale of a Southern belle, living through the time that was the Civil War. Scarlett O'Hara, a beautiful yet harsh young woman, is the female protaganist, and the story follows her journey, beginning in a time when all is well; the balls, the parties, the beaux. Her vindictive and manipulative nature pushes her to make a mistake or two, and she finds herself widowed soon after the war has started. The novel leads the audience through the abundance of obstacles Scarlett must endure, allowing the reader to sympathise with her during the lost love of Ashley Wilkes, the neglected love of Rhett Butler, and the terrible times she experiences throughout the war.Margaret Mitchell, despite the fact that Gone with the Wind is her first and only novel, narrates the story with an ease in both the plot and the dialogue, throwing the audience head first into a world where the negroes work for the white man, where war has broken out, and where it is innappropriate to wear a dress revealling your bosom in the morning.Compared to other anecdotes narrating stories of the Civil War, Gone with the Wind is not only a tear-jerker, but a tale that captures hearts, and fingers; leaving readers unable to put the book down.",
            "I first read Gone With the Wind as a freshman in high school, and now 6 years later it's still one of my favorites. I have always loved the movie version, and the book is even better. Mitchell creates wonderful characters--you may not LIKE all of them, but they're amazing nonetheless.GWTW is just amazing southern lit...it may seem long, but trust me it flies by. If you like the movie then definitely read the book--you won't be disappointed.",
            "Over the summer, a friend and I made a deal that she would read To Kill A Mockingbird, one of my all-time favorite books, if I would get through Gone With the Wind. I agreed, although it was hardly a fair deal, seeing as how GWTW is over 1000 pages, and TKAMB is a mere 300...but it was the best thing I ever did. Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind is an incredible book--Scarlett O'Hara is the single most unforgettable heroine I have ever encountered--and though I often felt like strangling her for her selfishness, stupidity, and greed, I fell completely in love with her anyway. I came to know her so well by the end of the book that for awhile after I was finished, there was a bit of a hole in my life, and I missed reading about her as I would miss a friend on vacation. Fortunately, all I had to do was open the book back up, and I was again immersed in southern Civil War America. Scarlett, Rhett, Melanie, Ashley--each and every one became like a dear friend, I knew their thoughts, their feelings so well. There are not guarantees that everyone who picks up this amazing book will be able to finish it--but if you can, you are in for the time of your life.",
            "Gone With The Wind is a timeless romance that depicts agreat picture of what life was like during and after the Civil War. Once loved by all the men in the County, Scarlett's life takes a turn after the war. She ends uo in Atlanta where her reputation is ruined by gossip. The ending was kind of disappointing, but it leaves plenty of room to imagine what could happen. There is something for everyone to relate to in this book. I have no doubt that this book will always be remembered as the greatest romance novel of all time.",
            "This was another book to be read and studied in English class. Every one of my peers thought that this book was going to be like most of the other books that we had had to read that year, but I wasn't so sure, as I was just beginning to learn to love the classics and literature books in the library. So, being curious, I read the 1024 page book in under a week, and I found it a marvelous book. It touches wonderfully on the hardships and problems of the civil war years in the South, and the feelings of the proud Southerners toward the Yankees and slaves after the war had ended and they found themselves stripped of their old ways of the plantation living (this book mainly touches on the lifestyles of the richer plantation owners, rather than the majority of Southerners, or the poor ones who owned just a little farm, and often no slaves). It centers around the story of Scarlett O'Hara, daughter of a great lady and a rich Irish plantation owner. It is a funny and charming story of Scarlett's love problems: she can have any man that she wants in the South, yet she wants an engaged man! The book goes through her funny predicaments and actions as she struggles to stay alive in the present, with her dreams of the past behind her...It also goes on about a notorious man named Rhett Butler, who associates himself with Scarlett, and yet who is not accepted in any home in Atlanta, Georgia, nor the South for that matter. This book is recommended to anyone who likes romance stories or books with heroines in them. In fact, I recommend this to anyone who can stand reading long, wonderful books.",
            "Gone With the Wind takes place in the 1800's and is about an American girl named Scarlett O'Hara trying to fit in Atlantas society . Scarlett is a ordinary girl who just seems to bend the rules a little.She goes to parties and balls like all other girls. The Civil War starts and turns her world upside down. She has to learn to do things that women don't do but she does it just to survive. She learns to work the fields, runs lumber mills,and a store. Society throws her out because she is doing things women wouldn't dare do even to survive. She has to deal with all the hardships of war.She loses many loved one due to fighting and starvation. While all of this is happening she meets a man named Rhett Butler who helps her tremendelsy. He picks her up from all of her troubles and survive and tries to get back her place in society. I would recommend this book for anyone who likes romance novels.",
            "Gone with the Wind is a classic that everyone should read. This book is filled with romance, adventure, and hope. Watch Scarlett weave her way through different husbands and lovers while trying to keep her family alive. As opposed to Melanie, Scarlett is rather self-centered and never really changes, she does not care what anyone thinks of her and is prepared to do her own thing. Melanie is a loving, caring, considerate young women who always wants the best for everyone, including her husband, Ashley and Scarlett. I think that this is a great book that is really worth reading. There is constatantly hope for better times, even when better times have come.",
            "Being a Atlanta belle myself and seeing the movie many times I decided to read the book. The begining was quite boring, but after I to page 300 or so I really started to enjoy the book. I really like it and was really sad when it ended, but some or the things I didn't understand. Scarlett really seemed to marry Frank for his money, but she also seemed to love him because she gave him a kid and she slept with him for a couple of years. She seems to dislike her kids, but at times she acts like she couldn't leave them for anything. I really felt sorry for Rhett in the end because in the movie he doesn't tell how much he loves her. The movie doesn't really interpret how bad Scarlett's live was effected by the war. I really loved the book and really wished Margaret Mitchell had a chance to write a second book.",
            "I had seen the movies like 20 thousand times when I decided to read the book. I got to about page 250 when I stopped uninterested. About three months later on a dare I checked out Scarlett and started to read it. I really loved it, but many of the characters mentioned were people I had never heard of in the movie. Very confused and wanting to get it all figured out I got GWTW and started to read it again. This time I made myself keep reading and after about page 400 it started to get really interesting. I read from page 400 to the end in two and a half days and was terribly upset when it ended. I think this a great book and know I am on a search for ever Civil War book written.",
            "I just finished this book and LOVED IT! The development of the book is great. The character development is great. IT'S JUST GREAT! Yet when she argues with Ashley it get's oh so gooey! If you want to read it but freaked by the fact that it's 1036 pages, trust me, Mrs. Mitchells writing style is easy and american and you'll be under its spell in no time!",
            "Gone with the Wind lived up to its reputation and then some. It is a story of the south at the time of its fall. It is a story of Scarlett O'Hara and her journey from being a immature Southern Bell to a mature intelligent women. It is a fantatisc romance novel.",
            "This book is one of the best ever written. It should be one of the books every family owns, right up there with Shakespeare. This beautifully crafted story takes you through 12 years of Scarlett O'Hara's life, and her heartbreaking romance. This book is impossible to put down once you start it.... everyone should read it. It's not tacky, or wishywashy... but real, and it touches the soul... trust me...read this book.",
            "Wow...Now this is a wonderful book. Gone With The Wind is something I know i should have read years ago! GWTW is so superbly a tale of the old south, and how it's changed by war. I was taken not only by it's vivacious and lively characters, but by it's wonderful forshadowing. And Rhett Butler, I just love to hate him!Gone With The Wind is a total must read!",
            "Me being 11yrs. old didn't think that I would like this book. Boy was I wrong. This is my favorite book of all time! The only thing that I didn't like about the book which I know almost everybody will agree with me on is that it ends so suddenly not even giving you a hint to the outcome. Margaret Mitchell is so good that she can even capture an eleven yr. olds mind with an adult book. This book is easy to put people you know in the characters spots and just sit there all day and daydream a new ending. Did I mention that I loved this book?",
            "I first read GWTW, when I was just a kid and fell in love with it from the first line. No other book has come close to how I feel about this novel (save for Pride and Prejudice, Persuasion and Rebecca all running close seconds!)If you have only seen the movie version of this book, please do yourself a huge favor and read the book. It is amazing! Scarlett has so much more depth as a person than the way she is portrayed in the movie (Vivien Leigh was a perfect Scarlett don't get me wrong) You will come to understand her motives completely if you just read the Book! Apparently I cannot stress this enough. This is just the best book ever written!",
            "Ok, here's the deal. This book was great. I mean GREAT! I read it in 6th grade. The whole thing was so, so, so wonderful! I luved every bit of it, Except for.....the end. I hated the end! Why did she just leave us hanging? I mean Tomorrow everything will be alright? What kind of ending is that? So I had to get Scarlett. I luved Scarlett too. And I was glad that there was actually an ending, but the ending was kind of boring.",
            "This book was beautifully written, and had just the right amount of romance, action, drama, and loneliness that it became a captivating novel. I could not put this one down. It is unforgetable.",
            "Gone With the Wind is the best book I've ever read! It is breathtaking and thrilling. It describes the civil war along with Scarlett's life during it. It is a really wonderful book that takes you back in time. I loved this book. I am only 13, and I think anyone my age should read this book, because it rocks. It is sad, but still its the best. Read it, and I know you'll love it",
            "&quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; was one of the most exciting books the I have ever read. I really like the part when Ashley all of a sudden has feelings for her. But, the best part about the book is how I could not put the book down. I first read the book 5 years ago when I was in the fifth grade, but then I re-read it last year. I understood it even more. I am now trying to give it to people so that they can read it. It is also one of my favorite books. I recommend this book to anybody, male or female, young or old. So enjoy &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;.",
            "I noticed that there are no Arabs casting their opinions, so i am glad to give you mine. When i was 14, my father gave me a special edition for the youth, and told me:&quot; read this book, you will enjoy it&quot;. Well, ladies and gentelmen i started reading it in Thursday afternoon, and i didn't put it untill Friday night. The book is simply wonderfull, and later when i was growing up (i am 28 now) i read the full version two more times, and some passages ( especially the first encounter between Scarlet and Rhett at the library)countless times. I think the strength of the book lies in its strong and very believble characters ( although i think there is little exaggeration in the power and charm of Rhett). The supporting characters are very believble as well, and although you might think that there is huge diffrence between USA and the Arab world, but the truth is we are people, and apart from few diffrences, the basic emotions, and behaviour are almost the same, that is why the book has such an enourmous success in all the world and with all ages and throughout its history. And as one of the reviewr pointed, that each country knew some major changes to its society, another reason why the book was a huge success. As for the romantic story, it is very powerfull as well. Finally, i would like to say, that i am almost Copy of Ashely Wilkes( without the skill of riding ..lol), and usualy i like the types of Melanie, but you can't help your self and admire Scarlett as a fiction heroine, although i doubt very much i would like her if i met her. I personaly strongly recommend this book.BUT i would like to make a warning for everyone thinking of reading the sequell, because the sequell is no more than a litreature piracy in my opinion, and it is a pure rubbish, and you can better buy a cheap romantic novel insted.I woul love if someone sent me an e mail.",
            "This book is even better than the movie--really! I began reading this as an escape from a pretty hectic time in my life, and couldn't put it down for about three days, until I got Scarlet out of the danger of the war. This novel combines romance, strength, family loyalty, love of home, and many other values into one exciting story. Definitely check this out!",
            "The first time I read GWTW was in the 8th grade. At that time, I didn't comprehend a lot of what went on with the characters. A couple of months ago I read it a second time--14 years after the first time. What an amazing difference it was! I truly related to Scarlett and Rhett. They are the all-time couple. The only part I hated was Bonnie's death. I think that affected me more now that I have a child of my own and I could feel the grief that Rhett was feeling. I will most likely read it again. It made me laugh out loud, think and want to cry. A very emotional read!",
            "I'm fourteen years old, and I read both Gone With the Wind and its sequel, Scarlett. This book is truly amazing. It's a story about Scarlett O'Hara, the belle of Clayton County, who falls in love with a man already engaged. She marries another man for spite, and, when he dies, she marries yet another in order to financially support her family farm. All this while, Scarlett is still deeply in love with the man she can not have. Finally, as her friend Rhett, a blockade runner, realizes she is his dream, Scarlett finally finds where her love really should go...too late.",
            "I am but 11 years old but I have read this book, and BELIEVE ME, it is definitely worth it. This book made me sob hysterically, laugh like a maniac, and understand what it was like to live during the Civil War. It actually made me wish I could have been alive during that time. My favorite character was definitely Melly. I won't spoil it for you but you have to read it.",
            "Wow, when i read this book i couldn't put it down! I actually saw the movie first,so when i read the book, I had an Idea what the charicters looked like. But i did not know that the movie was only half the story! I loved the movie just as much as the book, though others didnt. I have not read the sequal and im not planning to, from what i heard about it.My favorite charictor is Rhett. I dont know why. I think it is because whenever he popped up in the book, he always made me smile. I think that it was rhett and Melanie that made scarlett strong. They were standing behind her and pushing her along the way. Without them, Scarlett would not have been nearly as strong as she was. Gone with the Wind has some kind of charm that i cannot explain. From the first page it grabs you that no other book could posobly do. In this frenzy that we call our world, i know tht there was land of grace, beauty and, true love. Please read it!!",
            "What can I say? I LOVED this book. The characters were great, and the story was incredible! I love a book that can make you feel lots of emotions. I actually cried(a lot)! I don't do that a lot when I'm reading a book. It also made me feel happy, angry, blah blah, etc. The only possible downside is that the way slavery is depicted makes it seem better than it really was. But read it anyway, it's great!!! Oh, BTW, read the book first! It was so much better than the movie!",
            "I can truly understand why this book is so beloved to American culture. It has every single element of a great story written beautifully. The length may be daunting but I was surprised at what a &quot;short&quot; book it was to read. I absolutely loved Scarlett, though I wasn't so enthusiastic about melanie. If you haven't read it, you are MISSING OUT on something fabulous!",
            "This book is just wonderful! It's much better than the movie! I love how it is written, and how the charactors seem so real. Scarlett is so strong, but yet so misguided to what she wants. This isn't a perfect ending, but life doesn't always give a perfect ending, and that's what I like about GWTW. It's not a fairy story where everyone lives happily ever after, it's a story about live.",
            "I ablsolutely loved this book! It always kept me turning the pages. The descriptions were wonderfull and the story was the best ever!! This book will remain my favorite and it will always be remembered as a master piece. I recommend this book because I loved it and know you would too.",
            "This book is the best book i've ever read...it deserves more than a 5 star.I watched the movie last year and all i could remember is me smiling =) and crying =**|...it touched my heart! You've gotta read the book...you'll love it. Watch the movie too...it's a classic!***************************=)",
            "The novel Gone With the Wind was so beautifuly written that I cried at the end. This book descibes the south at the time before, after, and during the Civil War. It shows the strenth of a lady, Scarlett during these times. I love how Scarlett says at the end that she would think of it tomorrow at Tara. This is the best way Margrett Mitchell could have ended the book. Margrett did a outstanding job writting GWTW.",
            "The first time I read this book many years ago when I was still in high school and did not take the time to appreciate the book like I should have. Now that I have purchased this book and have re-read it I have fallen in love with the character of Scarlet. Although it is a long book, it is totally worth it.",
            "It is as powerfu ltoday as it was when it was written. The Old South is described with such detail, it takes your breath away",
            "I have loved this book since I first read it in high school and of course the movie too. Margaret Mitchell paints so vivid a picture of the South and their culture. The story between Scarlett and Rhett is timeless and classic. You will never find 2 people so made for each other. I love how in the end Scarlett and Rhett do not end up together and he ends up leaving her. I reread this book at least once a year and it I feel gets better and better every time I read it. This book has everything: action, romance and love and some of the best character development I have every read. I love this book.",
            "I have read this book many times over the years and decided having it on my Kindle would keep it available for reading anytime I wanted and now I may even read it more often.",
            "It doesn't get any better that Gone with the Wind. I have read it in book form at least three times. Seen the movie so many times",
            "I read this book at least once a year! It is so easy to get lost in the pages and Margaret Mitchell does an amazing job making you feel like you're actually there! Love it!",
            "I have read Gwtw at least 3 times in the past. Somehow I lost my book ina move, and saw it for sale on Amazon, and couldn't wait for it to comein the mail.I was very pleased to receive it in excellent condition ! Even though Ihave read it 3 times before, it intrigues me, and I can't put it down.I love the characters Rhett Butler and Scarlet O'Hara. I have the sequelScarlet and find that book is also very enjoyable, However NOT as muchas Gone with the wind. I will never loose my book again. I'm passing itdown to family who I hope will make this a keepsake.thanks. katie",
            "I have absolutely loved this movie from the first moment I watched it (want to say I was 6 or 7!). I finally sat down to read the book and while it took me a loooong time to finish it, I couldn't put it down. I see now why this book is so controversial, even today still. I love how things that didn't make sense, or you just wanted more of, in the movie went more into detail in the book. Melly dying, the chaos that Rhett and Scarlett went though when Bonnie died, how Scarlett landed Frank. Very good book indeed!",
            "this is a great book and I am enjoying every page. I read the book many years ago but it is worth reading again very nice to read on a kindle",
            "This has always been a favourite of mine, The more I read it, the more depth I see in the characters; their flaws as well as their strengths.",
            "Margaret Mitchel wrote only one book in her life. \"Gone With The Wind\" not only won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1935, but the film version won Best Picture in 1939 - opposite \"The Wizard of Oz\". Mitchel never wrote again, though in the mid 1940's she was struck by an automobile on Peachtree Street in Atlanta and her body was dragged for more than 100 feet.Her fiuneral was more majestic than Scarlet and Rhett's wedding.a signed first edition of this book today is worth well over $15,000.As for the new introduction written by Pulitzer Prize winner, Pat Conroy (\"The Prince of Tides\") He is, after all a Southern Writer and his own material is considered literature. I'll leave his words up to you. I respect his work a great deal. Even if not his opinion. And that's all an intorduction or a review is; a critic attempts to establish crredability with words. and in seeking out a Soutern Writer, though there are dozens of well qualified women writers (Lett's, Flagg, Kingsolver) With Styron, Clemens and Faulkner gone we are left with Conroy and John Grisham. I'd be interested to know what all of these people would write in an introduction.\"Gone With The Wind\" is a terrific story, fairly well written and highly emotional. It is one of the few war novels in history written from a woman;s perspective (that includes battle scene action) and the character of Scarlet O'Hara- our protaganist and ingenue - has become an adjective in describing other characters. In some ways, this novel; is a huge step forward for the feminist movement, but far more so it set the civil rights movement back subsgtantially and continues to every single time someone reads it. People read that book and actually believe that slaves were treated like family members. Mitchell writes about Mammy and Poke and Prissy passing along the perfumed hearsay her grandmother told her that the \"houise darkys\" are given \"family status\" but still Scarlett's frustration over Prissy's idlesness causes her to threaaten to break a switch acorss her back. Miss Scarlet runs into Big Sam as the Confederate Army leaves Atlanta to the Yankees while Scarlet must stay to bring Melly's baby (A love promise she made to Melly's husband)He is a Field Hand but she speaks with him because he is an overseer and only becausee the Yankee's canons and guns can be heard on the hprizon. She gaters information and does not wish him well;she will never see him again and as readers we never hear of him again. Neither the book nor the film do anything to expose what slavery was and the way in which \"Gone With The Wind\" has injured the rights for descendents of America-slaves is sinceely nauseating.There are millions who would break a switch across my back for this review. I saw go to it,k but you'd better re-read thge book before you do it. Perhaps watch the film as well, as it is less harsh than the book. (I own the screenplay)So by all means, everyone should read \"Gone With The Wind\". The more controlversial, the more one should read. But before you do, read Alice Walker's \"The Color Purple\" which also won the Pulitzer Prize. I've taught these books together as WAlker's also takes place in the South in 1935 and gives a clear idea of what life was like for the once-slaved,now impoverished. Thern read GWTW. After you get all teary and warm with \"Gone With The Wind\"(and you will be) then you must read William Styron's \"The Confessions of Nat Turner\", also a Pulitzer Prize winner, which was written in 1966, utilizerd what little is known of the trial of Nat Turner and tells us more truth about what it was to be a slave. If after that you still haven't gotten the picture pick up the recently published book about Paul Jennings, \"A Slave in The White House\"- the book that first speaks of a black man in the oval office, only he was dusting it, pouring drinks for President Madfison and he was, in truth, the one who rescued the lifesized portrait of George Washington. (Dolley Madison was a selfish, nasty woman who became frighened of her 104 slaves after President Madison died; oit is a fact, that during her lifetime at Montpieler after James died, Nat Turner's revolt occured and in New England the ship \"Amistad\" was overturned. For so many of us, fiction is a way to step into the minds and souls of another person in another world. With \"Gone With The Wind\" you run the risk of emerging a bigot.",
            "This is not a review or comment on Margaret Mitchell's work, but on the cheap, shoddy way that Scribner decided to package it. My daughter is in her third reading since we purchased this volume as a Christmas present in December, 06, and is the only one reading it in the house. Chunks of pages have begun falling out of the binding. The spine is paper, and not sturdy at that.I'm no expert on bookbinding, but this casts an image (for me, at least) of cheapness over the publisher. I'd like to have thought that for the price, this could have been expected to last a bit longer than 4 months.I guess this one's not going to be an heirloom. I've had many, many paperbacks that are in better condition after similar use.Sad, really, for such a wonderful work, to have been packaged this way.",
            "This is a great love story with more than a smidgen of insight into the human psyche, but it is also an offensive apologia for the American Original Sin--slavery. This is our Wagner. If you read it in public, don't forget the brown paper bag.",
            "I really liked this book. I'm a very very fast reader, and I read it in about one and a half hours. I really liked this book. It is a very nice story about the Civil War from a southerners point of view. You don't see very many books like that. I especially liked the part where they have to work in the fields. It shows that the Confederates didn't like the treatment of slaves, but they didn't care about the slaves. I kind of liked this book.",
            "I only knew the story from the movie, so I bought this book the week before we invaded Iraq, I'm sure at some subconscious level to read a viewpoint about war. The first half of the book was ok, I liked the descriptions of the suffocating constraints of upper class society at the time and Scarlett's rejection of them. The devastation of war and the struggle that Scarlett and her family went through were powerful. However, the second half of the book completely turned me off to the story. Margret Mitchell's descriptions of the reconstruction were so vile I almost put the book down. Blacks were only happy being slaves, they were too stupid for anything else. The only good blacks in the book are the ones who can serve the whites. Big Sam says he had enough of freedom and wants to go back to Tara. He's even incredulous that while in the north whites wanted him to sit at the dinner table with them like he was their equal, but he couldn't do it because he is not the equal to whites. Mitchell actually says that he smiles and feels better when Scarlett starts to tell him what to do because someone is telling him what to do again. Mitchell also uses animal metaphors when describing the black characters.At one point Mitchell is describing how the southern whites hate the Yankees so much because the Yankees have money and food and power and they do not, yet she doesn't have any sense of irony to see that the whites are in the position that they put the slaves in for centuries.And another thing that I did not like about the book is that most of the characters are serious sociopaths. They kill anyone who breaks their rules of racial propriety. Rhett kills a black man for being \"upity\" to a white woman, another character, one of the Fontaine boys, kills a black man for for saying something to a white woman. We are not told what but it is pretty obvious it was sexual, so we have the sterotype of the black male sexual prowler. Then the same Fontaine boy kills Jonas Wilkinson for telling black men that they are equal to whites and that they are alowed to have white women!! He doesn't just kill him, he cuts him to ribbons with a knife. There are many more examples of this psychotic behaviour. And Mitchell treats these behaviors as if they are to be admired. While reading I kept thinking these people are all nuts. I was glad they suffered and I'm glad they lost the war. I lost any sense of caring about what happened to any of them, including Scarlett.Also, this is a very anti-American book. Mitchell keeps going on about how awful the Yankees and the Union and the federal government are and how great Georgia and states rights are. Of course, states rights here means being able to murder anyone who annoys you. The reconstruction section of the book should be read by everyone just to show why the flying of the Confederate flag is so offensive. It is completely un-American.And one last thing. This isn't a great love story. Rhett is really only a supporting character in the book until the last 200 pages when they get married, and for a book over 1000 pages, that's not alot. I think people remember the movie more than the actual book.I was really dissapointed with this book. I was looking forward to enjoying a nice read and discovered that it was horrible propaganda. It is really hard to believe that this book won the Pulitzer prize over Absalom,Absalom! by Faulkner.",
            "Gone With the Wind was written by Margaret Mitchell and was published in 1936. This book is mainly about the difficult times for Scarlett O'Hara. The book was focused around the era of the Civil War. Gone With the Wind is a romance story about Scarlett O'Hara,her love of her homeland, Tara, and her search for love. She was jealous of Melanie Wilkes who married her cousin, Ashley, whom Scarlett desired. In the rage of Ashley marrying Melanie, Scarlett marries the first man who asks her, Melanie's brother Charles. Within 2 months Charles dies in the Civil War leaving her with a baby. She desperately tries to win over Ashley by moving in with Melanie and Melanie's aunt after Charles died. When Scarlett becomes bored with her living conditions, she goes to a fundraiser and meets Rhett Butler, a wealthy man from Georgia and he falls in love with her. But Rhett is very annoyed with the fact that Scarlett is in love with Ashley. Then tragedies start when the Civil War comes close to Georgia and Atlanta. Melanie gets pregnant and Ashley goes to war because Atlanta is attacked. Scarlett would have to escape back home to Tara before the Yankees come. Scarlett, along with her son Wade, her servant Prissy, Melanie, and Melanie's son Beau travel to the plantation Tara, where Scarlett was born, and Scarlett finds no food, no animals, only 2 remaining servants, a dead mother, an insane father, and 2 sick sisters. In desperation to survive, Scarlett marries Rhet Butler, and has a baby girl named Ella. She realizes too late that Rhett is her true love, but Rhett is tired of being second to Ashley, and leaves Scarlett. She decides she wants to get Rhett back, and then says \"I won't think about that today, I'll think about that tomorrow. After all, tomorrow is another day.\" I enjoyed the book a lot, and would recommend it to anyone who has a lot of time, and likes to read love stories. It was long, but the author, Margaret Mitchell told the story of the civil war very detailed and colorful, and had a way with her words to make ever page enjoyable, and memorable.",
            "I was a little disappointed with this hyped-up book. Melly was all good and Scarlett all bad. This plot is good, but I think Margaret Mitchell did not develop the characters as much as she could have. Humans are not either good or bad, everyone has a bit of both in them. However, I could not put it down, and it is such an epic story of American history that I would recommend it, just don't expect it to be as great as it is said to be.",
            "Atlanta belle, Scarlett O'hara ,deals with the impacts of the Civil War and the reconstruction of the south. Scarlett is a feminist, driven to extremes to ensure her future well-being and wealth; she is selfish and egotistical, but admirable in her stubbornness. This book is an epic, starting at secession and ending during reconstruction with carpetbaggers and scalawags stripping the south of its feudal past. The book is to some extent racist and revisionist southern pride. Was this Margarett Mitchell's interpretation of how southern's themselves feel in the 20th century, or does she truly believe that slaves were relatively happy as prisoners on a plantation? This book is heavy on the romance and light on the history, making it an average book",

            "The book is better than the movie, and might be worth reading if you need an immense tome to take on vacation. Much as I despise this silly book, I have to admit it is a prime page turner.Its chief interest as a book is as a window into the viewpoint of history so common in the white upper crust South in the 1930's. The casually racist attitudes of Margaret Mitchell are a good example, and enough to make any quasi-enlightened being howl with outrage. Ditto the views on Andersonville, Reconstruction and especially the benefits of slavery to Black people.",
            "Margaret Mitchell was my Great-Great Aunt. From her, I inherited some of my facial characteristics,and also a talent for writing. I first read my aunts book when I was in 7th grade, and fell head over heels in love with it. It was a story that depicted the life from a southern point of view. In a vast majority of the Civil-War era novels, the Confederates are made out to be unruly rebels. Not ALL southerners were like that. Take The O'Hara family for example,did not treat their slaves badly, as many southern plantation owners were made out to be. I'm not denying the act of slavery as being horrible, for I know that it was, but at the same time, Margaret showed both sides. She showed the hardships and difficulties, loves and pleasures of southern life, and for that I am unbelievable proud to say that I am her blood.",
            "Not a bad novel for a first writer. It could almost be a classic except for a few points - a) it's unecessarily long and could have used more editing; b) the second half is weak and not very interesting; c) it's description of Reconstruction is very one-sided and half-correct and d)it's too racist. Other than that, it's not bad.",

            "About twenty years ago, when I was a teenager, I read this book, here in Brazil.Today, I don't like to read any kind of fiction, but remembering what I thought then, I have to give four stars for it.Another american author of fiction, Sidney Sheldon was nothing, compared to the american woman that wrote this book.Good, but too long, fiction.Good art doesn't gets older.",
            "It took a long time to read, but it was very good. Unfortunately, there are certain parts that I do not recommend in it that are a little inappropriete (between Rhett and Scarlett). Margaret Mitchell portrayed a beautiful story in this book though! :)",
            "Gone with the wind is the best book i have ever read!! It was so awesome!! Its my favorite book ever!!",
            "GONE WITH THE WIND is an excellent novel for a first time novelist, despite its many flaws. Scarlett O'Hara is one of the most memorable characters in literary history and Miss Mitchell's description of the Civil War years in Georgia is well-paced and exciting. Unfortunately, the second half of the book does not live up to the promise of the first. The pace is not as swift and Miss Mitchell's description of Reconstruction is a tad one-sided (though understandably so). The novel's main weaknesses seem to be Scarlett's long-running infatuation for Ashley Wilkes. Given their characters and Scarlett's acquaintance of Rhett Butler, this infatuation borders on the realms of disbelief. Another weakness of the book is the lack of thorough editing. In Part One, Miss Mitchell nearly devoted an entire chapter on the Tarleton family, who happened to be secondary characters. Other than that, Miss Mitchell did an excellent job. It seemed a shame that she did not continue her writing career.",
            "This book has a very involving story and I quite literally could not put it down, though I did a few times in outrage over the portrayal of slavery, the Civil War, and the Reconstruction. This novel exemplifies the Lost Cause movement, which showed the Confederacy as noble but outnumbered, and slavery as a benign and paternal institution. It is worth reading for the story, but I shudder to think that some may take what it states as fact. I am not saying that the book should be banned or censored, but it is certainly difficult to read the numerous descriptions of freedmen as lazy and the countless explanations that slaves were just so dumb that they needed the care of white people.Also, Scarlett O'Hara is a terribly unlikeable character. Whether she is stealing her sister's boyfriend or daydreaming about murdering her only true friend, Ashley, her actions and thoughts will just appall you. She is also phenomenally oblivious, not realizing that Rhett loves her until it is far too late. I was sad that Rhett left her, but who could blame him??",
            "This classic Civil War-era romance novel won the Pulitze Prize in 1937 and was made into the classic movie audiences around the world know and love two years later. This terrific saga begins before the Civil War (which the Union won four years later, paving the way for the 14th Amendment, which ended slavery in 1865, several months after Abraham Lincoln's assassination) and ends during Reconstruction. I won't go over the plot again, as many who've either read the book or seen the movie (or both) know what it's about. Those who haven't read it, read the editor's reviews. One major difference between the book and the movie is that the book has a lot of cursing and the movie only has one swear word: \"Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn.\" The way Rhett (Clark Gable, who won Best Actor in 1934 for the delightful screwball comedy \"It Happened One Night\"; review coming soon) says that to Scarlett (Vivien Leigh, in the role that won her her 1st Academy Award for Best Actress; the 2nd one was also for Best Actress in \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" in 1954) makes it seem like it's not a bad word at all. Watch the movie AFTER reading the book, you'll appreciate it more. The book is rated PG-13 for intense thematic elements, strong vulgar language, mild war violence, some images of wounded, violence, intense domestic conflict, mild sensuality and brief nudity. The movie is rated G.SCARLETTEveryone expected a sequel to \"Gone With The Wind,\" but those hopes went up in smoke when Margaret Mitchell died in 1939, the same year the classic movie (see my review on it) came out and three years after it was published. Imagine how surprised I was when I found out about the sequel, advertised on the back cover of the Large Print Edition that I borrowed countless times from my local library before buying it from \"Doubleday Book Club\" (rarely do they have anything worth buying). Alexandra Ripley (who is she?) wrote this follow-up with the \"Permission\" of the Mitchell Estate and look at the result. True, the story picks up where the original left off, but a twist of the supernatural (what the hell was she thinking?!!) just ruined the novel. It too was turned into a movie starring Joanna W.-Kilmer and Timothy Dalton (two-time James Bond in \"The Living Daylights\" and \"Licence To Kill\" [see my reviews on them]), which I don't know if it's any good. Ripley got some things right (adding more backstory to Rhett, etc), but she completely missed the mark on others (killing Mammy off, what the devil were you on, cocaine?) It's good reading if you want to find out what happens between Rhett and Scarlett, one of the most famous love affairs in literature, but if you expect the sequel to be as good as the original, don't bother. The novel is rated PG for some violence, mild language and brief nudity.GONE WITH THE WIND:5 starsSCARLETT:2/1/2 stars",
            "(that is if it takes 6 weeks to read... so you better start reading!!!)In a word... you will RELIVE Scarlett's experience and she will become a person to you :) If you are a person who likes drama and human emotion, then this is the book for you! The fact that it is set against the chaotic background of the American Civil War is just an added bonus since the real storyline of the book is the tale of a woman's struggle against time and change when her world is falling apart.",
            "This book was very well written. It was a classic. I was intrigued at how well Margaret Mitchell spun this story together. Scarlett was a character that had so many different characteristics about her than I doubted it would ever end. You meet Scarlett O'Hara in Tara and soon you find out of her passionate love for Ashley Wilkes. War is declared on the South and Ashley marries his cousin Melanie Wilkes. Scarlett becomes jealous and as a way to get back at him she marries Melanie's own brother, Charles Wilkes. Charles and Ashley go to war leaving Melanie in Atlanta and Scarlett in Tara. Shortly after Scarlett gets a telegram informing her of her husbands death. She is desperate to get out of black widow's clothes. She goes to Atlanta to stay with her Aunt Pittypat while she tries to get used to wearing all black and never dancing. There they meet Rhett Butler for the first time. Soon Scarlett realizes shes pregrant with her dead husbands baby. Scarlett has the baby fine with no troubles. The Southern army passes through Atlanta and Ashley visits Scarlett and Melanie. Melanie gets pregnant. Nine months pass by and Melanie is deathly ill and is going to have the baby shortly. Siege is laid on Atlanta while the baby is near coming. Scarlett is forced to deliver the baby for all the doctors were busy with wounded soldiers. Scarlett takes charge and Melanie, Scarlett, Beau(The newborn), and Scarlett's child all flee to Tara. After a ravaging journey Scarlett makes it safely. After Scarlett sets up Tara to running again her and Melanie go to Atlanta once more. Ashley returns and Scarlett decides to marry her sister's bethrothed, Frank Kennedy, for his money. She uses his money to keep Tara running and she starts her own Lumber mill, something unheard of before this time, a woman working was taboo. Her husband and Ashley go to a Klu Klux Klan meeting and Ashley gets shot and Frank dies by a bullet to his head. Rhett goes and gets Ashley and saves him from the Northern army by pretending that Ashley had been visiting Belle Watlings house of 'ill repute'. Rhett proposes to Scarlett and they visit New Orleans and many places. Scarlett is happy. Then she has a baby girl who Rhett dotes on. Scarlett and Rhett fight a lot over silly things and then Rhett lets the girl jump with her horse and she falls, breaks her neck, and dies instantly. Rhett and Scarlett fight and Rhett comes home drunk one night and they have a few 'passionate' moments and Rhett leaves for good. He comes back and Scarlett tells him shes pregnant. He says rude things and she lunges for him, misses and falls down some stairs. She has a miscarriage and Rhett leaves with his famous line. \"Frankly my dear, I dont give a damn,\".",
            "Everyone knows this story, even without reading the book so I thought I'd add a bit about Mitchell's racist attitude towards the slaves. There are conversations amongst Scarlett and her family/friends regarding the Northern's erroneous assumptions about their slaves. They claim that they would never beat their slaves nor know of anyone that would behave that way. Of course we know that slaves were abused but there is huge denial here. Mitchell's characters also portray the slaves as child like, and the owners justify slavery saying that the Negroes are too child like to take care of themselves. Also remember that the men in Scarlett's lives are part of the KKK. Mitchell sees the group as Southerners protecting their family.It's astounding how much of this attitude is not commented upon. We could all learn that Mitchell's attitude is the type of thinking that people used to justify slavery and the treatment of Blacks after they were freed.Of course the novel itself is full of compelling characters, even if it is at heart a soap opera. Scarlett and Rhett are drawn so deeply that they feel that you would know them if you encountered them. By all means read the novel, but don't dismiss the racism.",
            "Margaret Mitchell may have only written one book, but she well deserved the awards she won and the praises bestowed upon her. I have read this book twice and was taken aback both times by her colorful yet brutally honest account of the Civil War, mixed with her artful and often humorous accounts of emotion and the social expectations of the period. This book is truly an \"objet d'art\", a wonderfully sculpted work, that is ageless and timeless. It takes one's breath away with its mix of humor and brutality; its insight of human behavior, propriety, pride, vanity, and patriotism. This book, and the part of her soul (a great part, I may add), will never die.",
            "On the one hand, Gone with the Wind is a wonderful novel. Scarlett O'Hara is probably one of the best female characters I've ever read in a classic novel. She is not nice. She is not good. And yet, the most interesting characters rarely are. Melanie Hamilton Wilkes and Ellen Rollibard O'Hara were wonderful women, but the point of Scarlett is she will never be that woman. She's resourceful. She's \"a scoundrel.\" When the women of the South are thrown out of their comfortable lives Scarlett claws her way back to the top - and doesn't learn until the very end that she lost everyone for it. Her determination is her greatest asset and her biggest tragedy. But at the end, when she has lost everything, she decides to keep going as always.On that same hand, it's a wonderful story. The five parts are set up like a Shakespearean Play. Margaret Mitchell, for all her faults, is a wonderful writer and her descriptions put you in the story. She's also an intelligent enough writer to be able to write from the viewpoint of many different people, even if she mostly sticks with Scarlett's point of view.But on the other hand, the descriptions of slavery are offensive. While I believe that there were probably some benevolent plantation owners and some slaves that wanted to stay with their families (although, in the novel, it's interesting that the \"house\" slaves - the ones who lived with the family day by day and recieved many more privilages - are the only ones who care to stay while the field hands leave as soon as possible), slavery was indeed a horrible institution. And the novel does seem to argue that it was all better before with slavery (although the North gets the brunt of the blame for wrecking things - even though the South are blamed for starting it). Also, some of the heroes of the novel are Klan members, and the only criticism of their choice is that it's \"too dangerous\" and \"not the way to get things done.\"As offensive as these thoughts may be to modern sensibilites, the novel still remains a great work of art. I resisted reading this book for a long time, but now I'm glad I did. For all its faults, I highly recommend it.",
            "Ok, wow! What a great book! I first saw &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; on a classic movie channel, and now I've read the book. If you buy it, you will not put it down - I mean I read 1041 pages in 3 days! This book will make you cry, for Rhett and Scarlett and is the best book I've ever read. It will make you cry so much, and personally, I really disliked Ashley for leading Scarlett on. This book is NOT racist, and it will give you a sense of romance better than Titanic ever could! The book describes Rhett's eyes, and make him come to life soooo much, and at the end it's sooo sad. Which is why I'm going to buy the sequel! Beware it leaves you hanging. Possibly the best book ever written EVER! BUY IT!",
            "Margaret Mitchell's classic may be an historical novel, but it is packed with the truth of what was done to a peaceful and blameless section of our Country. Most people do not realize the huge numbers of Europeans (unsuccessful in their Revolutions of 1848)who came to this Country, were given enlistment bonuses (when fresh from the boat) and allowed to wreak havoc on a people whom they held responsible for all of their miserable conditions. Mrs. Mitchell weaves an excellent story, filled with characters who are relevent, even in today's world, while utilizing, as a backdrop, one of the world's greatest tradgedies. It is obvious that Mrs. Mitchell used a large number of primary sources in writing her book, and it deserves to be placed at the top of every literate person's reading list.",
            "I purchased this as an ebook as I already own a 1936 copy of the book and a hardback copy for reading.Gone With the Wind is a timeless classic that I have read probably a dozen times. I never tire of the story and the author is amazingly descriptive. This is not your typical love story and it leaves you wanting more.",
            "I absolutley LOVE this book. It is not only the precedence setter for Historical Fiction, but it also paved the way for women writers to be recognized.Margaret Mitchell took a great many chances on the situations, characters, and \"scandals\" presented in this epic story of the Old South.It is the standard upon which all modern literary historical-romance fiction books are based.Good strong characters (many who were not even mentioned in the movie), and a story that is perfect for any season to read.Go ahead...buy the book in Hardback. This book accompanied me to war in the Middle East, and from its characters, I have continually found \"something new\". While you are at it..go ahead and purchase Donald McCraig's Rhett Butler's People. Make sure you read Gone with the Wind first, then set your engine speed on high...you are about to go into overdrive!",
            "This is a book that really made me think about human nature, about how we sometimes get stuck with an idea, a person or a memoire that no longer is what we think it is. Like Scarlet spending her life loving Ashley with all her heart, but what she really loved was an illusion, ironically the illusion of what Rhett truly was.",
            "There ae some books you read, love and remember forever. This was one of them. If you hesitate to read this just because it is such a popular book, or you think that it's a romance novel, DON'T. I read it a couple years ago, well after I was out of highschool. I didn't think that I would care for it. Boy, was I wrong.I was hooked just a couple pages into the book. I felt like I knew these people. I could not put the book down. It was one of those books you just can't wait to read and you drag it with you wherever you go, in hopes of being able to sneak in a page or two.Read this book. It will leave an imprint on you. I wanted so much to keep reading after it stopped that I tried to read the &quot;sequel&quot; (written by a different author) and was unimpressed. I returned the book after reading the first paraghraph. There's nothing like Margaret Mitchell's Scarlet.",
            "Review of Gone With the Wind By Chris WilliamsThe novel ''Gone With the Wind'', by Margaret Mitchell, is one of the stories that has stood the test of time and is still loved by many people. It is used as a building block for many modern love and war stories. This story is about war and about a woman's struggle to obtain the man she loves, or the one she thinks she loves. The main character, Scarlet O'hara has an inner conflict of who she loves, while a civil war goes on around her. It's a traggic story of how she marries men while thinking she loves another, Ashley Wilkes. The other main character, Rhett Butler, really does love Scarlet more than anyone else, but when Scarlet finally realizes that she loves Rhett, and not Ashley, it's too late and he leaves her. Both Rhett and Scarlet are very selvish throughout the story. Rhett's only concern is how much money he can make off of the war, and all Scarlett cares about is trying to win Ashley's heart away from his wife, Melanie Hamilton. This plot kept me reading and it kept me very intrigued, I kept wanting to see what else would happen to keep Scarlet from realizing she loved Rhett. Scarlet's struggle and the loss of her and Rhett's daughter Bonnie were key factors in keeping this story exciting. I think anyone should read this book, boys or girls could enjoy this classic novel about love and war. It is one of the best books I have ever read in my life.",
            "I LOVE this book! It is one of the only books I know of where the dialogue is so great that the dialogue in the movie was taken almost word-for-word from the book! And this definitely was the perfect role for Vivien Leigh, one of my favorite actresses.I just acquired a 1936 hardcover version of the book. I love old books and this will go terrifically with my collection. I feel like this copy could be the one Vivien Leigh read over and over before she got the role. She kept telling everyone she was going to get it, and they kept trying tons of other actresses for the role, finally giving it to Vivien Leigh!Gone With the Wind is an epic novel of great proportion, set in the dwindling Old South. A southern belle who doesn't believe in war or anything but her own affairs strives to control her passion for a married man while marrying three men for money. Her third marriage, to Rhett Butler, is complicated by their passionate, obsessive love for each other, which makes the book and the movie what they are. A classic, the book is also contemporary because many women today can find their own selves in the book. I feel an affinity for Scarlett. Hopefully, many other women are like the wonderfully kind Melanie Hamilton.",
            "The thing i just love about this book is the fact that the novel is literally identical, to the film and that is no mean feat, at times it can grate slightly, but the book is so astoundingly written that you overcome that, she mitchell has that incredible deepness that only people from the deep south have when telling a story and no one else has the ability to convey.It has every thing war, when war was romantic,a dashing rogue of a hero, and of course the herione and was there ever a herione like scarlett o hara.One of the most important times in americas history and all this played in front of the backdrop of the deep south.in one word astounding.",
            "Easily the best piece of American fiction I have ever read. It is not only one of the most touching love stories of all time &quot; Did it ever occur to you that I loved you as much as a man can love a woman ?&quot; is one of most beautiful things I have ever heard a man say to a woman - it is an amazing depiction of Civil War history, told from the southern perspective. And Rhett just spoils you - because you keep comparing every man you meet with him and they just don't come even close. Despite the fact that I'm a woman, when I read the book, I identified far more with Rhett as a heroic character then I did with Scarlett, because he is so unabashedly honest about why he does things, and he has courage to say and do things because he believes in them, even if the community he is a part of is too shortsighted or too willfully blind to see the truth of what he says. Scarlett is just a hardheaded egocentric little brat, and the only admirable part of her personality is her neverending grit and determination to survive against all odds during Reconstruction despite incurring the wrath of her society. But personally despite the fact that Rhett thinks they're right for each other, because they're both rebels, I personally think she's too stupid for him, she just never thinks about anything except what she wants and how she's going to get it. But I suppose going by the time in which the book was written women were expected to be stupider than men. Of course, in some parts of the world, including where I come from, it's still considered a good thing. Rhett is the best thing that happened to Scarlett, that's definete, though whether she's the best thing to happen to him is questionable. Maybe if he'd been able to stretch her mind and her heart a little while they were married I would think she was good enough for him. Aside from the personal story which has resoundingly real characters and the epic tale of the Old South, this book ( and the movie ) serves as stunning anti-war statement. It makes you realize how terribly futile and a waste of effort, resources, and most of all people, war can be. Anyone who misses this book has missed out on something wonderful. And as far as the end is concerned, it was really no more then she deserved after ignoring him for years and years, but of course you do want to know they eventually end up together, because you know that they will make each other happy.",
            "If you're a fan of the movie, you HAVE to read the book. It is packed with details the movie doesn't even touch. Plus I think the book is actually more entertaining, believe it or not. Reading the novel enables you to better understand the principal characters and the environment of the Old South. The movie, even though it is 3 1/2 hours long, is really a huge abridgement of the novel. So much is missing from the film. After you've read the book you'll understand what I mean. Finally, if you do read the novel, prepare yourself, because it is quite long and requires concentration to keep track of the vast amount of characters and scenes. Anyway, this is the best novel I've ever read, and I generally don't read novels.",
            "In the book Gone With the Wind, Margaret Mitchell accurately portrays both the struggles and triumphs of living in the Civil War-torn South. Through the characters of Scarlett, Rhett, Ashley and Melanie, she shares with us the many opposing viewpoints of the Civil War. Gone With the Wind is a book that is timeless due to its amazing ability to stun readers with its stark truth. Everyone can relate to at least one character: hot-headed, poverty-fearing Scarlett; her husband, the child-doting blackguard Rhett; gentle, sweet Melanie, whose love for the Cause is greater than anything; and and Ashley, the hater of all wars. For these reasons, I rate Gone With the Wind five brilliantly shining stars!",
            "&quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; is one of my favorite stories. As a writer and publisher I admire not just the craft of Margaret Mitchell but also that of her publisher. You do not find such excellence in editing and proofreading in today's books. This is one of those books so good, you find yourself turning again to the first page as soon as you've finished it!--Linda Donelson, author of &quot;Out of Isak Dinesen: Karen Blixen's untold story&quot;",
            "This was the best book I have ever read. I admit that it starts out slowly, but the rest of the book is well worth it. After reading the first chapter, I thought it was the most boring book in the world. But I kept on reading because of all of the wonderful things I have heard about Gone With The Wind. I was unable to put this novel down! I was engrossed in the story of the Old South. I highly recommend this book. It will be an experience you will never forget!",
            "I love Gone with the Wind. I love the experience of reading it than watching the movie. The book has a lot of characters that were not part of the movie. For example, Scarlett O'Hara had a son with her first husband, the brother of Melanie Wilkes.Another example, in the movie, during the escape of Atlanta, Scarlett, Rhett Butler, Melanie and her baby, and a slave escaped the burning city. The book includes a small boy slave (I forgot his name) who accompanied them to Escape from Atlanta and he has a role who was known to complain and nag Scarlett.I love the movie, but the book is very detailed with each character, especially their personality and family background.",
            "Preceding the Civil War, talk in Atlanta is rife with apprehension and speculation that warfare lies in the near future. Gone with the Wind revolves around the initially idyllic existence of a belle, Scarlett O'Hara, her unsteady marriage with the scandalous Rhett Butler, and her unforeseen reality during the heart of the Civil War. The sentimental page-turner demonstrates inspiring courage, outrageous fervor, and dramatic life alterations, in an emotional episode...brought to life!",
            "This books is one of my all time favorites that I read over and over again. Over the years I have bought many copies and love to give this book as a gift for birthdays. It also makes a great hostess gift! The descriptions in this book are so amazingly colorful and wonderful that you see the fabric, feel Scarlett's corset, taste the food. You run the whole gamut of emotions. Every time I read it, I laugh, I cry, I rage at Scarlett and fall in love with Rhett Butler. This book has always been an education and I always find something new to marvel at every time I read it. Buy this book, buy two and give one to a friend!",
            "I love this classic book. In the movie, the cast does a great job of making them realistic.However, several decades removed from the reading, I find something happening each time I hear the music, or see pictures of Rhett Butler. Romance, yes. But also an immense sadness. A sadness that suggests the main characters could change nothing even if they wanted to do so, that they were predetermined to fail. I hope we have more control over our lives than they.A second sadness emerges; the unending optimism of Scarlett. It begs the question: Could her life have been different if at any point she had accepted the inevitable? Tara really could not change the inevitable, but could she?I love this incredibly sad story, and appreciate the history it relives for us all.",
            "Absolutely my favorite novel. It's a long one, but everyone should read it...men and women. Not only is is accurate historically, but it is also educational and interesting. The novel is far richer than the movie, and although the motion picture is a spectacle....the book puts the movie to shame. Read the book, and watch the movie again afterwards. The differences are astounding....but that is what keeps the novel interesting to modern readers. It's isn't the exact story we have seen on film on TCM again and again. Again, everyone should read this book. It has literary value, historic value, and pleasure value.",
            "GWTW-I discovered it on the shelf of my highschool library & having never heard of it, I decided I would read it. I was completely unprepared for the ride! While we all want to be Melanie, the truth is-we're all a little Scarlett on the inside! I have since read the book many times (and of course own the DVD) and never tire of it. A definite book for gals-you get a glimpse into southern life at the time of the Civil War and experience a love story of enormous preportions. &#34;Fiddle Dee Dee&#34; is our catch phrase around the house! LOVED IT&#62;",
            "Not only is this book very moving, but it is one of the most popular historicals ever. Albeit, I did think it was long and I sometimes got tired of reading about struggle after struggle and pain over and over, this is the kind of book that shows the strength of people. When you get done with this book, it will leave you satisfied.",
            "Gone With The Wind is a passionate,heartthrobbing,beautiful,romantic tale.I saw the movie when I was 4 but it didn't make much of an impression on me because when I began reading it in bookstores when I was 6 I was immediatley enthralled with the story of Scarlett O'Hara,the sweet Southern Belle that when the War made many hard changes in her life she became a woman that did what she felt like and didn't listen to other peoples disapproval.Margaret Mitchell has brought many hours of joy to me as I read from her wonderful book every day of my life.I love Scarlett very much as the main character but Melanie is more dear to me.She is a beautiful,shining,kind woman that always saw Scarlett's and Rhett's good.She goes to show what we have lost from that era.Many people hate Ashley and think he's a wimp but that's only his potrayal in the movie.In the book,he is like Rhett but takes diffrent paths in the same situations.All the characters in this book,the lovely description,and the era make this book\"my favorite book of all time\".",
            "This is one of the most fascinating book that I have ever read.In its sweep, it focuses not only on slavery but also on the impact of war (however justified or inevitable) in people's lives. Scarlett's character is brilliant. Her transformation from a butterfly to a tough woman who loves her land, her struggles against poverty and her determination to rise above it, her passionate nature are just some of the remarkable features of this book. Its almost as if in the character of Scarlett, the author has put in all the dreams, hopes and aspiration of America of the mid 1800's. The description of life in the south makes the book all the more enchanting. Above all, its a great romance- A wonderful summer read. Scarlett's character, could be the voice of many women across the world even today.",
            "It has been said that all fantasy books are &quot;Lord of the rings&quot; progenies. If true, then all romance books have &quot;Gone with the wind&quot; roots. Every hero worth fantasizing about has Rhett's dash and every heroine seems to have Scarlett's spunk.I first read this book after years of loving the romance genre. It was already some 5 decades written and the author was long gone but I remember thinking: &quot;Wow, so this was how it all started.&quot;",
            "Gone With The Wind is one of my favorite books as well as a favorite movie. Margaret Mitchell has relayed thestory as though she was actually there. How does she know so many small details? Are they real or imaginary?Well, fiddle dee dee! They do seem real. This will be the 4th time that I have read the book. Saw the movieat age 14 on my first date. Cried and cried. And when we broke up that boyfriend told me that frankly, hedidn't give a damn.",
            "Loved the book. If only Rhett and Scarlett could have been on the same page at the same time. I know they loved each other. Scarlett is so strong if only she could have stayed out of her own way.",
            "I have read this book a few times, seen the movie 32 times, so I LOVE this book. I learn something new about the civil war and the customs of the time every time I read this story. It is so beautifully written. This particular edition I purchased is a true gem. It is beautifully bound and truly a book I can pass down through the years. It was every bit as good as the seller said it was!",
            "This book was advertised as large print which is what my elderly mother needed. It arrived and it was not large print but normal print. The company apologized and stated they did not have a large print but to keep the book they sent.",
            "My most favorite book and move of all time. I had not read the book since high school and 50 years later, it still is my most favorite book. I also read &#34;Scarlett&#34; and &#34;Rhett Buttler's People&#34; - sequels to Gone with the Wind. Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!",
            "If you're like me and Gone with then Wind has ranked as your favorite movie of all time, you won't be disappointed with this read. All 1,037 pages while worth the read. And I was pleasantly surprised how much more detail and different the book was than the movie. As awesome as the movie was, the book is even better! A must read for all true southerns!",
            "Most incredible read. I highly recommend it to all age groups. So beautifully written it was so though I was brought to scene of the story.",
            "Love the book and the movie. The books so are I am only about a quarter of the way through but it is great",
            "An American classic historical novel. Not only a great story, but also lets you feel the changes wrought in society by the U.S. Civil War in and near Atlanta.",
            "Margaret Mitchell clearly captured the heart and view of the Confederacy during and after the Civil War. Her vivid descriptions of people and places make it easy to visualize the story. Her attention to detail and accuracy make GWTW believable window into the lives of 1860s Georgia.Her style of writing is easy to read and lazily draws you back to the Antebellum South until you find yourself an intimate observer of a lifestyle based on an economy of slavery. Mitchell's book doesn't apologize or campaign for the institution, it just presents a picture of what was.I find I revisit Gone With the Wind every ten years or so, and each read brings a new light to a classic novel.",
            "Its an unforgettable experience. When i read this book, i was not aware of any hype about this book. I just remeber the day i read this book in the library, back in India. Its a sunny morning. I just picked this book from the reference section, as i was waiting for some card or something, and started reading it. It was 7 in the morning, Few minutes would have gone,i think becuse, i have shifted myself a little. Suddenly somebody tapped me on the shoulder. Its the librarian. She said its 10 at night ans she is closing the library. She allowed me to take the book with me and I read it on and on until 8 in the morning, which was when i finished it. For 24 hours without food and sleep, without even a silghtest glance away from the book.Wahw Its truely an incredible experience.For one whole day i was beside the Scarlett, mind and soul.It is at that moment, i decided if Americans are down to earth as those characters, then it should not be very bad place and i came to America. After i came here and what i found, Its totally different story!!!",
            "I read this amazing novel approximately two years ago, since then I have read it several more times. It only took me about one week to read, I was so wrapped up in it that I put off homework to read it, I simply couldn't put it down. Believe me I don't read anything that fervently, other than Gone With the Wind. It is so descriptive, it wraps you up in this amazing story of love lost and lives, wasted on petty things. I personaly felt for the characters, being a hellraiser myself, I truely felt for Scarlett's plight and pain. I think that if you are a person who can be unaffected by all the media hype put into things, and just read this book you will be swept away by it's dazzling imagry and depiction of life and love and loss.",
            "I am turning 13 now, and I first read this book when I was only 11 years old. It took me a while, but it was worth it. Gone With the Wind is the best book I have ever read so far! I loved it so much. It was very interesting, and I couldn't put it down. At some really exciting parts, I felt almost as if I were in it. This book was definitly the best book I have ever read and I recommend it to anybody.",
            "Gone with the wind was a story about a sothern girl who live in the southern part of the united states. The story tells how her life was before, during and after the civil war, She started as a bratty teenager who turn into a heartless woman,who hurt her sister and push a way a man who turly loved her. She let moeny take over her mind and soul. The stroy also goes on to tell how the civil war had on the south part of the united states.. this is a good book to read.",
            "one of the clasics and most loved books. my mom's favorite (and now mine!) she forced me to read it to improove my english and after a while i loved it! the story is sooo great, the characters are very interesting and are beautifuly descripted (as everything in this book- situations, etc.) if you liked the movie you'll love the book! Mitchell has done a great job! i can't describe the filling of reading it! it truly carries you away for a while! you think you're actualy there. it's a wonderful book!!!",
            "I loved this book! It was written in a descriptive language, but it was a level that everyone could understand. Maybe that's why people love the story. There is always one character (at least) that you can identify with. Just a warning, don't read it and expect to know all about the Civil War. It will talk about it, but it concentrats (spelling, sorry) more on Rhett and Scarlett than the war. Some say that it was racist. Slavery was wrong, there is no doubt about that, but there were always different kinds of masters. The masters in GWTW were obviously kind ones. This presents the way the South saw the war, which was very VERY hard on them. Read it and do yourself a favor. Just a suggestion, though, watch the movie first (which is also excellent) and then read the book so you won't be dissappointed with the differences.",
            "Yes, I would recommend this book to my friend because I think anyone who loves to read about history would love this book. And also anyone who loves to wear ball gowns would love to read about all the costumes Scarlett wears in this book. Over all anyone could love to read this book.",
            "I must admit, before I read the book, I watched the movie! And I liked it so much, I picked up the book and read it cover-to-cover in a matter of days! I absolutely could not put it down! Scarlett is my all-time favorite female charactor, and the whole setting is wonderful. If you have not read this book yet, what are you waiting for?",
            "I first read this book at 16 and it was the first (and about the only) book that would make me get butterflies in my stomach. Mitchell's language is very easy to read. Although some of the characters have what I consider character flaws, by in large the novel is quite entertaining.",
            "This is the best book ever written. Margeret Mitchell is the best author of all time and Gone With the Wind is both the best novel and movie of all time. I can't get much better than this description of the South. It never has a dull moment and the only ones who don't fully enjoy it is those who cannot understand it.",
            "I first read this book when I was a teenager. It has never lost its appeal to me. This epic saga emcompasses all of the major elements -- love, war, history, and memorable characters -- particularly the charismatic, witchy heroine Scarlett O'Hara and her male counterpart, Rhett Butler. Starting when Scarlett was sixteen, and the belle of the county, with dozens of beaus, she quickly moves with the times when war sweeps the antebellum South. In love with bookish, sensitive Ashley, she sees him off to the Civil War while marrying someone else, just because Ashley married someone else. She is quickly widowed, and journeys to Atlanta to stay with relatives. She has her eye on Rhett Butler, a stockade captain who plans to make money out of \"the fall of a civilization.\" For everything about the old life is being swept away in war -- \"cotton, slaves, and arrogance.\" Over the course of the novel, she slowly discovers who she truly loves, and goes for him. But he is too proud to reveal his true feelings for her, as she stubbornly clings to another man. Saving her plantation home from carpetbaggers, she decides to marry Rhett. It takes two tragedies for her to find out who has been saving her as a damsel in distress all of these years, and that he \"loves her to distraction.\" The novel is full of truths and themes that coincide again and again -- love triangles, the fall of an era and who survives the times in style, and friendship, family, and true love.",
            "Gone With the Wind was a fantastic book. It's about this young woman, Scarlett O'Hara, who is living during the Civil War-in the south. Her rich and perfect life is ruined once the south loses the war and she is thrown into a time of starvation and misery. She becomes a widow and has to face those troubles as well.Mitchell created the character, Scarlett, wonderfully. She had spunk, determination, intelligence, and selfishness-traits that made her personality interesting. She does what ever she needs to get her by. Then there's Rhett. He's this dashing man who is no gentleman. I have to say, he brought a little bit of light into the dark parts of the book. He seems to be just a rude, mischevious man at first, but later on, Mitchell makes his character more full, shall I say. His character is deep and full of emotion and feelings-I really can't describe it.Then Margaret Mitchell created a bond and passion between these two characters. It was a wonderful romance, with love and anger-a sort of bittersweet romance. I felt I could connect with these characters.I loved this novel; I couldn't put it down. I read it at a young age, 11 to be exact, but I was into it none the less. It kept me hooked for 7 weeks until I finally finished it. It's long-really long-but absolutely worth it. I loved it, loved it, loved it! This book tied together historical fiction and romance, my favorite types of books, into one novel. It is a book not to be forgotten-ever.",
            "I am only 11 years old. Still, no one stopped me from reading the classic, Gone With the Wind. I encourage myself. When I started reading the book, I got so caught into Scarlett, Ashley WIlkes, Melanie, and Rhett Butler, that I felt as if I were living with them as well! When I got to the end of the book, I felt as if Margaret Mitchell had left out something very valuable, like she hadn't really meant to publish the un-finished book! I am getting very crazy about Gone With the Wind, and it's truly the first book that I can ever say sincerely that was my \"Favorite book\" ever! For anyone who thinks Gone With the Wind's words are too small, or that the book is too \"mushy and gushy for us,\" it's not! It's a nice, sad romance novel that I shall remember forever. Please read it. I am currently asking for the book, in hardcover original edition, for my birthday.",
            "Scarlett: you love her, you hate her. Rhett: the lovable rogue that every romance hero is measured against. An epic romance set in the antebellum era, &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; gives you a portrait of the timeless southern belle who has it all, loses it all, gets it back and - loses it again? Mitchell's fans will forever regret that she never got the chance to answer the question.",
            "This novel definitely stands the test of time, still as good as it was when I read it over 20 years ago. A great romance combined with great historical detail. Rhett Butler is still my favorite character, brilliant, sarcastic, flippant. So many people do not read this because of the movie, but the movie is a pale imitation. Please Read It! You won't regret it.",
            "I had not seen the movie before picking this up to read, so reading this book proved to be a real treat. I was immediately drawn into both Scarlett's and Rhett's characters. The way in which their lives wove in and out of each other's was beautifully told. Mitchell presented them as real multi-dimensional people, with both good and bad qualities. When I saw the movie after completing the book, I was completely disappointed with it. While the movie stayed fairly true to the book (not changing anything important), it DID omit several things that I think were crucial to understanding Scarlett in particular. (I won't ruin it for your readers.) I HIGHLY recommend this book, even if you've seen the movie. It has quickly replaced The Count of Monte Cristo as my new favorite book of all time.",
            "When I first started reading this book, I was like, &quot;ok, great, another borefest...&quot; but Gone With the Wind soon became one of my favorite books of all times! Scarlett and Rhett were some of the best characters I had ever encountered. A 5 star timeless classic!",
            "I just finished this book yesterday, and I can't stop thinking about it. Seriously an amazing story. The writing, the characters, the details, and the historical context were all perfect!I LOVED this book. Everyone should read it!",
            "I first read GWTW when I was a teenager and recently reread it after reading several books about strong women. The book is just as good as I remembered. Stories about brave women who keep moving forward have always inspired me. If you have never read GWTW, do yourself a favor and take the leap. Mitchell takes you right into the heart of a time that affected all Americans. Living in Atlanta where the book was set makes it even more appealing to me. After you finish this book, take a chance and read about other strong women that are alive and well, even as I write this. I was blown away by Mayada Al-Askari, in Mayada, Daughter of Iraq.",
            "I just loved this book! Filled with human drama, emotional conflict over basic values, and set against a war for civil justice. I saw the movie seven times! But the book was seven times better! I plan on reading it until the pages wear so thin that I can see right through them! Gone With the Wind beats any other book I've read including like my math book. This is the right way to study history! Signed: An enthusiastic 12 year old! ;-)",
            "a book about romance usually bores me. It's no more than datings and marriages and divorces and remarries and who loves who. But definitely not this one. Mitchell has set an example on how to write a great romantic novel. And it's not merely a romance, it's a historical romance. And Mitchell was not merely an author, either, she was a historian. I see this book from three perspective; as a reader, a woman, and a college student majoring in International Relations. As a reader, I surely recommend this book to anyone, especially those interested in Civil War, American History and last but not least, romance. But one small tip, you might consider reading this book during your long break, since it's hard to put it down. As a woman, I view Scarlett O'Hara is a pure material girl, until life gives her valuable lessons about losing all the people she actually loves all her life that she did not realize before. But Mitchell created a good balance by adding a lot of good personality traits; hard working, courageous and brave. I admire especially her fast maturity she got after the O'Haras lost their once prosperous plantation and her high ambition to bring it back to a great plantation after Civil War did a damage to it. Also, Scarlett values richness not just for the money and pleasure it brings, although she did say several times that money is the most valuable thing in life. She also values richness to satisfy her dreams to see the world. As a Southern woman ( well-bred too ) on her time, Scarlett surely was one of the few who values brain beside beauty , which she shows by running her second husband's store and lumber yard and not a bit pay any attentions to other Atlanta ladies who despise her. Scarlett might be full of airs and graces, but she keeps it in the right place and the right time. Thirdly, as an international relations student, this book is qualified as a history book on the Civil War. Mitchell added a great deal of details not only about Civil War but also about slavery, which brought me to give more credits to her. A lot of book about slavery in the South view black slaves only as those who were looked down by their white masters. But not in Gone With The Wind.Mitchell viewed them as part of the family who had their white masters' full trust, like Pork, Mammy and Uncle Peter. It is the first time I found out that they also had something as social status in those days by being owned by different kind of white masters.",
            "This novel is a great piece of historical fiction, and it's not just for women, either. Set in the American Civil War, the story is about the life of a Georgian Southern Belle who is abruptly thrust from her pampered plantation life into the harsh realities of a very brutal war. Only her courage, strength, and resourcefulness get her through the wartime travails. That, however, is only the beginning of her struggles. After the war Scarlett faces the challenges of poverty, loneliness and death. She ends up being married three times (and burying two of her husbands), owning her own businesses, killing a soldier (and stealing the money and goods in his pockets), and generally doing everything considered unladylike at the time. Fictional characters set in an historic time, this book is a classic in every sense of the word. I've read it countless times (I still get something new out of it each time) and it should be in every well-read persons library. The movie of the same name follows the story closely (although some things had to be left out in the interest of time), stars Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable, and is widely regarded as one of the best films ever made.",
            "This has to be the best book ever written. You abosolutly will love this book. While Scarlette acts like one you would detest, you can't help but love her and all the other characters. If you've only seen the movie, you are in for a huge suprise. Lets just say Bonnie is not the only baby.",
            "This novel is a spactacular piece of work! At first the size of it scared me a bit, as it would most people my age, but boy am I glad I decided to read it! Scarlett is an amazing character, and the history is great. If you haven't read this classic, you are really missing out on something.",
            "Although I'm only 13, I have already read this compelling novel twice and am trying buy the book so I can read it even more! You feel like you are Scarlett's shadow, following all her movements and peeking into her mind and seeing her reasoning for her actions. My fave book!!",
            "This is a book that I believe everyone should absoluely read. From the first page to the very last you are entrolled into the deep south. The literate is beautiful as long as the glorious love story. I spent all my free time reading this book and was always thinking about Scarlet and what would happen next. This is the book that I would recommend to anyone, a lover of literature or not. When I finished the book and wiped the tears from my eyes, I was sad it was over. I wanted to go back and live in the time with Scarlet and never wanted it to end. Once is never enough with this masterpiece.",
            "This book was really good-it seemed to come alive as I read it. The main character is really amazing-not a friendly person-but she does stuff every one else was too nervous to do. Even though she grumbled all the way. Read it- but skip Alexandra Ripley's Scarlett. I'm sure she did her best, and GWTW is not an easy book to follow up, but it is nowhere NEAR this book.",
            "What can I say that hasn't already beign said? I think this is the most entertaining book of all time, not to mention historically accurate...I read it for the first time when I was 16 and in high school, and to my surprise, when we studied the Civil War a few months later in school, I already knew most of the battles, generals and dates! LOL :=)...this book is a gem.One more thing...though I think the movie is an absolute masterpiece and a must-see, I nevertheless think it doesn't do the book justice. It ommits too much. The movie doesn't show us Gerald's story and how he ran away from County Meath, Ireland straight into Georgia, Ellen's heartbreak when Phillippe Robillard was murdered and her resolve to run away frome her memories; but mainly, and what truly makes me sad...the movie doesn't develop the myriad other characters. What I mean is, it focuses on Scarlett, Rhett, Ashley and Melanie. However, the novel tells us of India and Honey Wilkes, Cade and Cathleen Calvert, Tony and Alex Fontaine, Sally and Dimity Munroe, the four Tarleton girls...you get to know so many stories...and since I truly loved all these characters, I missed them in the movie. Of course, there would have never beign enough time in a movie to cover all this...but, perhaps a miniseries could :=).P.S. By the way, in the novel, Brent and Stuart Tarleton were two very cool, masculine guys, as opposed to the dancing idiots we are shown in the beginning of the movie ;=) !",
            "This book is so overwellming we dont know how to tell you. even the begining of the book starts out wonderful, ful of detail, characteristics and a sense of humor. the plot is wonderful, and its not at all like an ordinary book. it shows emphuism and spirit as well as a sense of characters and people. this is a wonderful book and trust me if u think its to long, it isnt it actally is to short. u just have to start reading it, then youll get what i mean.",
            "This book is very attention grabbing it keeps you interested and is one of those books where you always &quot;just have to read one more chapter!&quot; Margret Mitchell is a true genius, and a very gifted writer. If you haven't seen the movie yet, I suggest you read the book first, you'll apretiate the movie more! The motion picture that was produced is the only one I know of that truly lived up to the book it was made after",
            "This book was in great shape as described, the packaging was sufficient and we received the book in short order. Thanks.",
            "I gave it 5 stars because the shipment was fast and the book itself was really good. I disliked nothing about the book.",
            "I bought this book for my wife, and as usual, it arrived on time and in great shape. No problems. As usual, 4 Stars because only God is Perfect.",
            "Only just started this book, but know what it's all about. Will enjoy it I am sure as I read on.",
            "I originally purchased this volume back in the early 80's when the series was first introduced. Each volume in this library has a beautifully decorated binding (similar to expensive leather bound books but much more reasonable in price) and when dispalyed as a set, the effect is stunning. I bought this copy as a Christmas gift for a friend in Austria who is an avid reader and book collector. As a European, I felt his library was incomplete without the greatest American novel ever written, Gone With The Wind. The copy is authentic and even though fairly old, it was in great shape! I highly recommend this seller and this set of masterpiece volumes for anyone who is considering assembling a library of literary master works.",
            "Came quickly and just in time for my moms birthday. Considering most people have probably read this masterpiece, I'm just going to review the quality of the hardcover itself. It is well done. My mom didn't wanna read her first edition anymore as she was afraid it would fall apart. Perfect substitute if I do say so myself!",
            "They told me it was lightily worn, a couple pen marks, and they weren't lying. I got it just how I expected. Great service, came so fast in the mail.",
            "The book arrived on time, in good condition, however, I was disappointed that it was a paperback version. I should have read the comments closer and I would have known it was not a hardback--in which case I would not have purchased it. I do not feel it will remain in good condition for long and I am worried that the binding may work loose with reading and also will not store well on my shelf. I do not understand why this book was not offered in a hardback edition, after all, I would think most people purchase them to add to their collections and plan to keep them for many years.",
            "The book actually provides a well-balanced explanation of southern attitudes and responses to the Civil War, reconstruction,their \"culture\",womens place in society and class consciousness among both blacks and whites. Great history. But Scarlet and Rhett do get tiresome, I do understand better now what made them tick.",
            "The book quality was wonderful. Perfect leather and even includes papers from when it would have been ordered from the publisher. Took a bit too long for delivery due to local ground mail service taking too long, but arrived perfect. Classic!",
            "Well, I think Margaret Mitchell could have used a realy good editor. I don't mind reading long books quite the contrary I assure you, but well, one tiers of hearing yet another story about Scarlett doing something or another that gets her scorned by the people so they gossipe and Melly has to stop them. One time is enough!The story line for those few people who do not know it is the following: The young Scarlett O'Hara who is the favorit of all men falls in love with her friend Ashely Wilks who marries his cousin Melanie (Melly). Scarlett wants to hurt Ashley so she marrys his brother who soon after they are married dies in the war. Then Scarlett earns the scorne of the populus of Atlanta with her scandales behavior.Melly has a painfull childbirth and Scarlett takes her to Tara (her home) as the Yankkees march into Atlanta Georga. To Melly this kind act of careing for her wins her undieing respect.The story continues from here but I will not. The rest of the book centers around Scarlett and Rhett Butler and their feelings towareds eachother.I do not want to give the wronge impression it is not a bad book or even a book I disliked, it was great to read on the nine hour plane flight fom Budapest, but, after the plane ride was over and I still had 300 pages left I felt like I was wadding through quick sand to fininsh. If I had been on the plane for about 2 and a half more hours I would not feel this way but back home where I had so many other book to read I began to look at it as a waste of time. I am glad however that I have read it. Though I would have certenly looked at it in a more appeling light had it been hacked down about 300 pages.",
            "Ok, so I'll say it. I hated the movie Gone with the Wind. But, in an effort to be fair, I decided to read the book. I thought maybe it was something about the production that I didn't like. But, no, the book has many of the same problems.Reasons to Hate GWTW:1)It's endless for one, just like the movie. Over a thousand pages and a large bit of it is completely unecessary.2) Rhett - I don't care what anyone says, he wasn't handsome, he wasn't romantic, and there wasn't much to like about him.3) Scarlett - I've never seen a more annoying female lead. And everyone says, \"oh she grows up in the end! she stops being selfish!\" She doesn't.4) If you don't like the two main characters, what's the point?Needless to say, it was a waste of money for me and I gave my copy to a friend who loves the movie. At least she'll enjoy it.",
            "It was a very well written book but everyone told me this was a good romance book. It was not a romance book, a romance book is a book where both people love each other. Rhett loved Scarlett for most of the book, but Scarlett did not love Rhett so how was this romance?It was very good other than that though, I had trouble putting it down just to go to sleep. It is very well written and unlike some authors she actually puts in a lot of description.",
            "GONE WITH THE WIND is a book that deserved to win the Pulitzer prize for its well developed Characters and fine writing but PLEASE don't buy it as history.I see no reason to call the Atlanta citizens &quot;rare courage&quot; unless you mean half baked!The slaves -- yes for what they endured.The Union troops (Black and White) fighting to preserve the Union IN FREEDOM and President Lincoln who went through hell for the nation but NOT the Confederates who were only seeking their own advantage and trying to tear our nation apart to establish a slave empire.Sorry but facts are facts.",
            "I thought that amazon would have fixed the problem by now, but no. Page 713 is still missing, and in its place is page 813. I just got it in the mail as a Christmas gift and decided to check to be sure. I am so mad and disappointed with Amazon right now. Hopefully they will resolve the problem quickly. Bigtime bummer.",
            "The book and movie will always be remembered for the classic line:&quot;We'll always have Paris&quot;.",
            "Gone With the Wind was captivating and enjoyable. When I was in the middle of this book, I was reccomending it to everyone I saw! Then I came to the ending. The ending was disappointing, sad, and flat. Who wants to be left hanging with a book this good? No one! I plan to read the sequel, Scarlett. I figure the story line can't get much worse than how it ended in Gone With the Wind. Read it once just for the experience. You probably won't want to read it again.",
            "Ugh -- By the end of this book, you're going to want to slap Scarlett silly. I'm angry that I wasted the past month of my life reading this book. Mitchell must have been getting paid by the word because she goes on and on and on about nothing. This book could have easily been 600 or 700 pages shorter. The romance between Rhett and Scarlett is not believable. A cold, drab book. Save yourself the agony: rent the movie.",
            "I have to admit one thing about this book. She got her Civil War facts right, which is more than we can say for some authors who have tried writing novels about the war. Other than that, I have nothing good to say about this book.Scarlett is one of the most annoying characters you'll ever read about. I realize she's supposed to be that way, but frankly I didn't care what happened to her or anybody else in this book. She got on my nerves right from the start.My biggest problem with the book was how racist it was. Critics of Mark Twain call his books racist, but Tom and Huck are probably accurate portrayals of kids growing up in that time and place (at least regarding their thoughts on slaves). To have Tom Sawyer make a comment that sounds racist to us is one thing, but in this case the author shows her own racism. A slave who came back south after visiting Boston with a Union officer complains about being expected to sit at the dinner table with the white people, who obviously didn't know that the black people were inferior and should eat in the kitchen. This was probably her view when she wrote it, but if you could go back in time I doubt if you'd have found any slaves who didn't want their freedom, or who didn't want to be treated as equals by the white people of the time.I've never understood the popularity of this book or the movie. If you want to read a good Civil War novel try something by Howard Bahr or \"The Killer Angels,\" or \"A Soldier's Book,\" or \"Enemy Women,\" or \"The Red Badge of Courage,\" or \"Shiloh.\"",
            "Along with D.W. Griffith's \"A Birth of a Nation,\" this nostalgic and wish-fulfilling \"riches-to-rags-and-back-to-riches-again\" romp across Civil War history is more than just the archetypical racist American novel. Together the two constitute a kind of sub-cultural \"power-duo,\" that captures perfectly the mindset that ushered-in a century of American Apartheid, and arguably that still governs much, if not most of American culture. \"Gone With the Wind\" is literally \"cotton candy\" for the Conservative/racist/Southern American mind.In the most syrupy and sophomoric of prose (perhaps ever written by an American author), Mitchell lays it on heavily. Scarlet, the archetypical southern bitch flaunts and wields her unearned entitlements with great immoral facility, demonstrating that even when down and out, \"being white\" still \"counts\" for more than anything else. Even when ravaged by the Northern Yankee soldiers, being a \"Southern white woman\" still demands royal treatment, and commands the regal stage always hovering well above and over all the lower animals, and especially, and most notably, over all the blacker ones.Let us admit it up front: Gone With the Wind is an important novel only because of its slightly transparent racist subtext, which still resonates with a large reservoir of American thought, habits, feelings and culture. And although the structure of racism, which the book appeals to, still remains pretty much intact and unperturbed, it is no longer respectable to acknowledge it, or most of all to speak of it in other than \"coded language.\"Griffith's movie, and Mitchell's book are perhaps the first \"coded\" version of racism that captured perfectly the American mindset, and thus are both valuable in this respect alone. It is in this sense only that Gone With the Wind is perhaps the best of this genre - eventually spawning the like's of John Jake's series on the North and South, etc.Meaning no disrespect, and noting that it won the Pulitzer Prize, being the best of this genre does not suggest that the book is being measured against a very high standard. But despite this and despite it's mean-spirited, amoral and wish fulfilling subtext, it is not easy to deny that this novel has earned its place in the pantheon of American history and literature. Since it remains such an important nostalgic representation of the racist American way of life, and is the best of its genre, it deserves at least four stars.",
            "Great Classic, an awesome book. A must have for all who love reading. I really recommend it. I'm still reading, it has over 1000 pages, also a true gift for those who love old stories like me.",
            "THIS IS THE GREATEST BOOK EVER!!!!!!!oh my godI have read gone with the wind sooo many times and im not a book person. it's soo fantastic but when ever i re-read it i can't even finish it because i get so sad. Scarlett O'hara is the best fictional character ever.",
            "This is an incredible book. The story is enthralling, the grammar superb... whether you like adventure, romance, or historical fiction, this is the book for you! And the price is a bargain!",
            "I first read this book in fifth grade, for a reading contest. Since then I reread it about every other year. Mitchell takes me into a whole different world with her story of Scarlett and Rhett, Melanie and Ashley. I love it!",
            "This is one of the best books ever.",
            "(4.5 stars, actually)I've never seen the movie all of the way through; every time it's been on I've either tuned in after it started or had to eat dinner, go to bed, or something that necessitated my having to interrupt my viewing of it. Reading the book finally got across the story in one piece. I normally dislike what Hollywood does to books adapted for the screen, but after reading the book, I agree that this is one of the few exceptions. And if you liked the movie, the book will be even better because of all of the characters and events left out (such as Scarlett's older two children Wade and Ella). One thing the movie was right to leave out, however, was the stomach-churning racism.I have no problem with an author having characters spout viewpoints that are racist (sexist, anti-Semitic, homophobic, etc.), but here those viewpoints aren't just limited to their dialogues and inner thoughts. There are a LOT of editorial commentaries on, for example, how wonderful slavery was, how the only good slave is one that was happy to be a slave, and all of the old stereotypes about African-Americans (sexual predators, lazy, childlike, superstitious, easily frightened, snoops, liars, thieves, you name it). The word &quot;Negro&quot; is never even capitalised, and many times the other n word is used to refer to them, as in &quot;a niggery smell&quot; and &quot;trashy free-issue niggers.&quot; I know that in 1936 no one was saying African-American or even Black, but at least you could capitalise the word Negro or not use the word &quot;darky&quot; so often! Many of the African-American characters even call themselves and members of their own race the n word. These slaves support their white masters, hating the slaves who dare feel themselves equal to whites and who wanted to be free. There are also two anti-Semitic slights; on page 734 it says of Hugh Elsing (who is incompetent and not very smart in business) &quot;Anyone could Jew him down on prices.&quot; On page 759 Rhett asks Scarlett if she might have some Jewish &quot;blood&quot; in her as well as Irish blood because of her love of money. The real reason Scarlett hires convicts to work in her mill is because they're cheaper, easier to exploit, and less &quot;uppity&quot; than the &quot;trashy free-issue&quot; former slaves. What other book with such racism on nearly every page is still in print today?Most Southerners were Crackers and white trash, not rich aristocrats like Scarlett and her friends, yet there's not one good word to be found about the Crackers. You'd think the aristocrats were in the majority and that barely any slaves were ever mistreated or had just cause to run away. They didn't even see how ironic it was that they were in the destitute position that the Crackers and slaves had been in for generations. The racism gets even more frequent and ugly in Part Two, the Reconstruction era. You'd never know that the KKK were a terrorist organisation; we're supposed to applaud these racist murderers and feel bad that the Yankees have taken over control? The only Southern state to avoid martial law was Tennessee, because they ratified the 14th Amendment. But of course, the other Southern states were too proud and angry to do that. And they got what they wanted before long; Reconstruction ended, African-Americans were effectively barred from exercising their Constitutional rights to vote for almost a hundred years, the Republicans (who were the progressive party way back when) were hounded out of town and threatened away from the polls, and the rich white men regained monopoly over the polls. The way it's written, you'd think the newly freed slaves, the Republicans, and the &quot;Scallawags&quot; were the ones going around terrorising people instead of the Democrats and the KKK! Still, the racism isn't the main point of the story, so I can overlook it to a point since the rest of the story is so great.The characters in the book are even better than in the movie; here Rhett isn't some charming rake, he's downright nasty, sleazy, seedy, suspicious, like an interesting-evil villain on a soap opera, the bad guy whose motivations are interesting and not mean for the sake of meanness. He's an incredible match for Scarlett, a strong empowered woman in her day and age, not afraid to flount social conventions by going out in public pregnant or shortening the period of mourning after her husbands die, a woman who has the smarts and the guts to run her own businessess because her second husband is too soft-hearted and incompetent to run them properly himself. Ashley is also a lot better in the book; he's such a doofus in the movie, but here we can understand why Scarlett is in love with him all of these years, why he inspires such passion and devotion in this fiery woman, a woman who wouldn't have spent so much time and emotion on the wimp he's portrayed as in the movie!The book does a great job at showing a Southern pov in the Civil War and Reconstruction; it would have been perfect if there hadn't been so much repugnant racist editorialising and just presented the viewpoints of these people from a vanished way of life in an unbiased way. It just looks unprofessional, besides racist, for an author to constantly inject personal opinions into the text.",

            "The book was intended as a gift but was in too poor condition to be given. I was disappointed.",
            "This is one of the best fictions I have read in American literature. It narrates the personal struggle of our not always likable but always resilient and resourceful heroine Scarlett O'Hara, and her relationship with the cynical and worldly Rhett Butler. It is also a sweeping saga of the people of the American South (mostly two locales in Georgia: Tara Plantation and Atlanta), spanning from antebellum to Civil War to the Reconstruction. Michell's writing is superb; it is full of details and nuances to the southern life, especial life in the plantations and life in Atlanta. The personalities of the characters are consistent and believable. Even descriptions of minor events and characters are vivid, such as the conversion between Gerald O'Hara and Mrs. Tarleton and her daughters on the way to the barbecue, from the chorus of the girls' shrieking and arguing you really get a rich and lively picture of antebellum Southern life. Of course, we shouldn't confuse the author's nostalgic and overly-romanticized view of Southern plantation life with reality, but this is a fiction, not a historical study. I find it hard to fault the author for painting a picture from the perspective that she chose (that is, a white plantation owner's perspective), just like you cannot criticize a painting of peaceful rural scenery for not exposing the garbage dump and outer house.But the book is not without flaws, and I see two major ones:1. Racism. I don't think anyone can really defend the author for this. It is one thing that her characters say and think in racist terms, but she also expressed such opinions numerous times in the narrator's voice. Some defend her by saying that it is because of the time (1920s-1930s) that Michell wrote this book; that may be true, but it does not exempt her from such criticism. I would rather say it is a \"flaw of her time\" than \"not a flaw because of her time\".2. The reconstruction part (Part Four) of the book is a little dragging. Some tangential characters such as Will Benteen and Archie introduced in this part are an awkward fit to the storyline and they certainly do not add much to the central plot (not surprisingly, they were completely eliminated in the movie). In this period Butler's role also became more shadowy, except at the end when he rescued the men from their ill-fated Shantytown revenge. I get a sense that Mitchell was really critical of the reconstruction and she was just drawing this out to give herself more room to air her criticism.Nevertheless, even with these flaws, it is really an exquisitely crafted piece of work. It will always have its place in the Alta of American literature.",
            "It started very slow for me, with Scarlett's fleeting thoughts about her dresses and balls. Then every time it became intriguing the conflict resolved itself, except for the conflict between Scarlett and Rhett which only gradually compounded. The d&eacute;nouement was poignant and well conceived-- perhaps it's just the romantic in me but I choose to see the end as just the beginning.",
            "I loved that book and i couldn't put it down. It is one of the few books that just keep you occupied in your mind long after you finished it.",
            "I never read the book before, saw bits of the movie and have heard so much about it that I thought I should buy it and add it to my literary collection. It's thicker than other versions and the print is small, if that is no problem then go ahead and buy it. My version had a few weird quirks like accordian pages and uncut pages which caused it to protrude from the book and there were ink smudges as well.Content wise, I found the book to be well written and I enjoyed Margaret Mitchell's use of imagery. The words flowed, the book was interesting and of course you're going to love Rhett Butler. This isn't a true depiction of slavery and you shouldn't use it as insight into how life was like during the Civil War, although it might give you some idea and it's interesting to read from the Southerner's point of view. Obviously there will be some annoying aspects. I found it difficult to understand the slaves and skimmed through most of their dialogue and of course you might even get annoyed that the slaves were depicted as their most loyal pets that never question their masters and didn't want their freedom.But if you considered what time it was written and by whom, then it shouldn't dampen your enjoyment of your book. It's a book everyone should read. It really is good literature and worthy of the prize it won.",
            "Why would someone want to read a story about some spoiled rich girl? It is all in the art of the storytelling, and Mitchell is a master at the craft. It has been 16 years since I read this story and I can still remember the first sentence. As soon as I read it I was hooked. Although this is mainly a love story there is more to it than meets the eye. Mitchell takes us back in time into the very midst of the civil war. It is viewed from the perspective of Scarlett who cannot fully comprehend what is going on around her, yet the reader can feel an indescribable sense of loss through her story. During her trials, she perseveres and discovers a sense of strength within herself previously unknown. Great historical romance.",
            "I really can't describe how I feel about this book and about Scarlett. She is a character without parallel. You can't help admiring her even when you deplore her for her failings. Amazing.",
            "I loved the movie. It's actually one of my favorite movies but the book puts it to shame. The book is brilliant. It's masterfully detailed without belittling it's reader. Beautifully tragic.",
            "No other piece of work has ever captured the Old South quite like \"Gone With The Wind.\" I highly recommend this classic to any person who wants to learn more about this vanished world.",
            "I was amazed at how interested I was in a classic - I have always thought and saw them to be pretty good books -although some modern ones definitly outshine them. But Gone With the Wind was a tearing, heartbreaking classic, the book so heartfelt. I could certainly relate to almost all things in the book. It truly showed a real look into humaity - something I think many people need to do these days.",
            "Gone With the Wind was a fantastic book. It's about this young woman, Scarlett O'Hara, who is living during the Civil War-in the south. Her rich and perfect life is ruined once the south loses the war and she is thrown into a time of starvation and misery. She becomes a widow and has to face those troubles as well.Mitchell created the character, Scarlett, wonderfully. She had spunk, determination, intelligence, and selfishness-traits that made her personality interesting. She does what ever she needs to get her by. Then there's Rhett. He's this dashing man who is no gentleman. I have to say, he brought a little bit of light into the dark parts of the book. He seems to be just a rude, mischevious man at first, but later on, Mitchell makes his character more full, shall I say. His character is deep and full of emotion and feelings-I really can't describe it.Then Margaret Mitchell created a bond and passion between these two characters. It was a wonderful romance, with love and anger-a sort of bittersweet romance. I felt I could connect with these characters.I loved this novel; I couldn't put it down. I read it at a young age, 11 to be exact, but I was into it none the less. It kept me hooked for 7 weeks until I finally finished it. It's long-really long-but absolutely worth it. I loved it, loved it, loved it! This book tied together historical fiction and romance, my favorite types of books, into one novel. It is a book not to be forgotten-ever.",
            "I first watched the movie when I'm 14. Just totally obsessed by it and started to read the novel. I'm now 17 and had read the novel 3 times in Chinese and one time in English and watched the movie for 5 times. It is (will be) the best novel I had read... the novel is better than the movie, more better. Dont' read or watch the sequel!! You will disappointed. Scarlet and Rhett only live in Gone With The Wind. When it ask &quot; How do you rate this book?&quot; in this review. I just can't stop laughing. Can it be rated by stars?",
            "Margret Mitchell uses wonderful descriptions to show a way of life that has long disappeared from time. The characters are fantastic and the conflicts in the book are numerous: Scarlett's love for Ashley, Rhett's love for Scarlett, the plight to salvage a lost cause. I saw the book as more than a love story. It shows the many emotions people go through as they mature and change with the world they are presented with. Gone With the Wind should be a required book for anyone who enjoys this genre. The movie is also good, but it doesn't include everything the book has to offer. I laughed and cried, and even though it's long (around 1,000 pages), I loved every moment, and wished it were longer. (It got really good at the end and then it ended)",
            "Mind blowing! The book was amazing!! One of the best experiences of my life was reading it. The movie did not do anything much tho' the casting was superb. The sequel was pathetic, Alexandra Ripley: go boil your head! You're nowhere near the real thing!",
            "Gone With the Wind is, without a doubt, my one and only obsession. Since reading it at age 10, I have attempted to acquire everything that I have found to be associated with this extrodinary book. I am now 16 and my love for Gone With the Wind is still exceedingly strong. Alexandra Ripley's so-called sequel was good but her Scarlett and Rhett did not suit the originals. Margaret Mitchell was a superb author with a genious for portraying saucy, touch-me-not characters like Scarlett and smooth,arrogant ones like Rhett. Throughout the book Scarlett's insistance that she would always love Ashley and Rhett would never have that privilege perfectly led up to the ending where she finally realizes that she only wanted Ashley because she could not have him. Gone With the Wind is the best book ever written and in my mind that fact will never change.",
            "This is the best book in the world. If you haven't read it, you have to! This book is so real. You feel for Scarlett and cry with her and laugh with her. It's to hard for me to write in words how wounderful this book is. You have to read it to fell and understand it. If I were you I would drop everything and run to the store and buy, buy, buy it!",
            "When I first picked up Gone With the Wind, I thought that I would be reading it for the rest of my life. To be true, it only took a few weeks to finish and it was the one of the best books I have ever read. I thought that Margaret Mitchell was perfect in her way she described the Civil War with a romantic twist with it. I ended up reading this book for my Honors English class and it was worth every minute of it.",
            "'Gone with the wind' is one of the greatest love stories ever written. It has withstood the test of time and has emerged as a novel, absolutely unforgettable. I am not even American, yet Mitchell's art of writing and the vivid and real-like descriptions enrapture the reader's imagination crossing all regional boundaries. This book has to be bought and not borrowed, to enjoy its splendour completely.",
            "This has got to be one of my favorite books. Historically accurate and breathtakingly written, you get a real feel for what it was like to live in the Antibellum South. I actually finished the book thinking how much I hated Scarlett as a character, but her journey through life was a magnificent ride. I was actually glad that this book was so long, as I turned page after page and didn't want it to end. It's an accomplishment to finish such a lengthy work, but it was well worth the effort. I love this book.",
            "Gone with the wind was one of the best novel i have read so far. The story was so excited and you can't just quit reading it.It holds your emotions through out and you'll never get bore. The character of Scarlet O'Hara was the dominant one in the story but i don't understand why she always behave Rhett badly when he always loved her so much. The most sympethatic character was of Melanie who dies at the end; and she was the one who was taking caring of every body in the home. Ashely character was not bad but i don't know why he always think about the old south. Overall the story is the best.",
            "I simply love this book! I read it when I was 14.Its still the best I've ever read.I'm now 45. The film was good (seen it more than 5 times) but the book is even better. The sequel was a disappointment, the film Scarlet even worse. Nobody could ever write and feel like Margaret Mitchell.",
            "I loved this book! I've read it like three times. I always recommend it to people. When you read this book it takes you back to the time and for a moment you wish you were there.",
            "I was forced to read this book by my mother when I was in Seventh Grade. She said it was the best book that she had ever read, so I decided to try it. I started to read the book, thinking that I would hate it. But as the story line progressed, it grew on me more and more. I was enthralled with the strength and courage that Scarlett had. This book was way better than I thought it would be. But the ending, which made me cry, dissapointed me. And I threw a fit because I read such a long story with such a horrible ending. But I now realize that I was just too young to read this book in 7th grade. I'm in 8th grade now and maybe sometime soon I'll read it again and understand it better. After you read this book the story will stay in your mind forever. My favorite character, strangely enough, was Rene Picard.",
            "When I first got GWTW to read and saw how long it was I said to myself this is going to be bad and take forever to read, but I went on to read it not knowing why. Many of my friends thought I was crazy reading it, and frankly so did I. Well I started to read it and really got into it. It was so exciting and thrilling I never wanted to put it down. The story of Scarlett O'Hara really touched me and made me realize everthing that we take for granted in life. Also how if you want to be noticed in life and be remembered than be different. Scarlett did many bold things during the war, and even though she had trouble keeping husbands she finally fund a true love one whom she thought she hated. This book was full of surprises and throughly heart warming. It will make any reader make his or her outlook on life so much better, and give them more hope in a &quot;wacky&quot; and strange world like ours.",
            "Last Christmas, I received Gone With The Wind, and before I even went back to school, I had finished it. I read it all day for a week, and when I finished, I felt like my heart had been squeezed. It was so amazing. I have persuaded friends to read it, have posters of it hanging in my room, and simply love it!!! This is one of my favorite books!!!",
            "Just finished reading all the reviews people posted on GWTW and I'm overwhelmed by the love people have for this book. I'll admit it's not my all time favorite (that honor belongs to By Love Possessed, by James Gould Cozzens), but GWTW is still one of the greatest literary experiences a person can have. It's the type of book one simply disappears into, you have no concept of the outside world--your world is Tara, Twelve Oaks, Atlanta, and your friends are Scarlett, Rhett, Melanie, Ashley, et al. You forgive them their indescretions and love them for their humanity. Oh, and I hated the Alexandra Ripley sequel.",
            "I love this book. It is so heartbreaking, tragic, and romantic- it just kind of draws me to it. One of my best friends took three years to convince me to check it out of the library. Finally I did and I wish now that I hadn't waited so long. I'm 13, and I think this book is awesome, and I don't even like romances, and I haven't even finished it yet!!!! This is a must-read for anyone with a flair for the dramatic, and anyone who doesn't like it can just shut their mouths!!!",
            "The thing that stands out the most in my mind is how different it was from the movie. All the little extra things that happen in the book that don't happen in the movie (i.e. Scarlett has more than 1 child) Anyone who loves the movie owes it to themselves to read the book. Don't be put off by the number of pages. You'll come away thinking, Gee I only knew 1/2 the story!",
            "WOW. Possibly THE BEST book I have ever read. My mother took me to see th rerelease just recently at a theater in Dallas, and when it was over I didn't want to leave. I mean, the movie was 6+ hours long and I still wanted more!! So I went and bought the book. My favorite part has to be(besides the fall of Atlanta)the ball in which Rhett auctions Scarlett. It is a perfect example of their feelings for each other. I love all the characters. Timid Melly, Rash Scarlett, Careless Rhett. A must read!!!!",
            "This novel has it all! Where else can you read about love, honor, tradition and free enterprise? Given that she is a woman with charm, beauty and brain's, it's no wonder that the men in her life naturally &quot;flocked&quot; to her. I have read GWTW several times, and I still find myself more enthralled each time. I admire Scarlett's survival instinct, and her raw ambition. GWTW will forever be a timeless american classic!",
            "This is a timeless movie, people of all ages love it. I love the ending, it makes you use your own imagination on what happens after Rhett leaves. The so-called sequel was the biggest mistake the Maragret Mitchell estate could of ever made. As far as I am concerned, that book was no sequel, but a seperate book altogether. They can say whatever they want about Titanic, but let's see if it can last half as long as GWTW.",
            "It takes you through the story of a girl that has everything and wants just what she can't have, and through the story of how her world fell around her. About Scarlett and her men, but never having her one love",
            "Gone with the Wind's anti-hero is captivating and complex. Scarlett is complex in her own mind, tormented about what she wants vs what's right to do, while she fights to survive during and after the Civil War. She is selfish and aware of it. Adding to the complexity of Scarlett, is her kindness that she affords others despite her selfish desire. While she is the daughter of a slave holder, she remains loyal to caring for her former slaves after the war and has a developed relationship with Mammy. Unfortunately, the social thread of America, and much of the world from Bible days going forward, thought nothing wrong of owning slaves. However, that social paradigm shifts as the story continues. Scarlett might be from a wealthy family, but she is still a female that bucks societal trends and owns and operates business. On occasion she is outright ruthless with men. In the end of the book she is \"punished\" for her misdeeds. However, her husband is not.It surprises me that many people compare GWTW to Birth of a Nation. The problem is we are viewing GWTW as if it can be held to today's value system. It does not. It cannot. It's not a book about human unity or human dignity. It's a book about surviving crisis and how some American's got through a war that killed 12% of the US population. In the 1920s and 30s the KKK was very strong in the South and perpetuated stories about black attacks on whites and many political groups argued that blacks were not fit for society. Using genteel approaches GWTW presents strong women who helped the south survive the war, it also showed blacks as \"southerners\" and caring people (Scarlett's life is saved at least twice by a black character in the book), it also suggests that war is not a wise solution. Scarlett gets away with voicing unpopular opinions \"war is a waste of time\", \"the south should just free the slaves\", \"why should women always stay quiet around men?\" because she's portrayed as an anti-hero. If she were a do-gooder she might come off differently. Pretend she had Melanie's \"kind nature\" combined with her practical and self serving criticism of \"states rights, sexism, & war\", she would be seen by many readers in the 1930s as almost being an abolitionist sympathizer. The book would have failed at that point in delivering it's message about survival. The message would be lost. Furthermore, it wouldn't express what many southerners already felt, a kinship and love of the land. When you read the last paragraph of the book you get a picture of what prevails in the south, the love of the earth, southern life, quiet country evenings and the simple relationship of Scarlett and Mammy (the only person she has left: her father and mother died, her friend Melanie died, daughter died and her husband left). Scarlett also realizes too late that she is in love with Rhett and losses him, just as the South realized too late that \"states rights\" cost them what they loved the most.",
            "GWTW, the great American epic, certainly earns its reputation by being a big sweeping novel of the collapse and rebuilding of the American south. Mitchell's research about the many battles in and around Atlanta is evident, as is her knowledge of Southern plantation and urban life. But despite all of her research, her personal bias is evident and clouds her recounting of history. Mitchell is a product of her times, Southern born and bred 70 years after the civil war. She believes that slavery was not so bad, and the slaves were treated like family and were protected and cared for. Her descriptions of free slaves in Atlanta makes one cringe, and she devotes half of chapter 37 to this narrative with quotes like, \"There they conducted themselves as creatures of small intelligence might naturally do. Like monkeys or small children turned loose among treasured objects...\" Another of her characters, Big Sam, a former slave on Tara has tried freedom and doesn't like it and is trying to make his way back to Tara where he knows he will be cared for again. Nowhere in the book does Mitchell make reference to the hard and inhumane lives slaves lived, and the fact that they were property with no rights or lives they could call their own. She even tries to justify the existence of the KKK, saying that the free blacks were running so amuck over of the whites that the Southern men, who had been stripped of their rights by the Yankees, had to do something to avenge these wrongs.Putting aside all of Mitchell's personal bias about slavery, I did enjoy this book and ultimately felt it was a many layered love story between Scarlett, Rhett, Melanie, and Ashley, all intertwined in matters of the heart. Scarlett, the central character and most interesting by far, is a modern woman ahead of her time. She is outspoken, strong-willed and a shrewd business woman. She does whatever it takes to get what she wants in affairs of business and the heart. She is a fully developed character with a range of emotions from pride and pettiness to compassion and understanding (although she tends to lean more toward the former emotions). At times we thoroughly dislike her, others we can relate to her, sometimes we pity her and occasionally we even cheer for her. Mitchell also spends time developing her other major characters, Rhett, Melanie and Ashley, and by the end we feel as if we really know all of them.Despite its 1,000 pages or 41 hours on audio cd, which I listened to, I never got bored, and in fact didn't want to end. The story always moved right along. Someone was always dying, getting married, having a baby, going to or planning a party, plotting, scheming, or getting into or out of trouble. It is melodrama at its best and I am so glad I actually read it instead of just seeing the abridged story in the form of the movie.",
            "wow. loved it. i will definitley be reading this book again and again. i always loved the movie but the book is simply amazing. such complex and interesting characters. its hard to believe the age of the book the style of writing seems ahead of its time. sorry for typos, on my kindle.",
            "I read this book the first time at the age of 13 and 10 years later I love it as much now as i did then. This story is an emotional rollercoaster that will make you hang onto every word. The characters are vibrant, the settings rich, and the tale a timeless one. The ultimate love-hate relationship story.",
            "he falls for a bad woman and thinks that she will turn good for him. But she does not. The latent goodness that he imagines never comes out. He does not mind her bad qualities and in fact admires them. But he does not want them applied to him, at least not all the time. He thinks she can separate them out and give him her good qualities, and just enough badness to make the relationship exciting. It does not work. It works only in romance novels, where the heroine falls for a rotter who is nice to her only while still remaining \"difficult\" but not too much. In this case, where the woman is the bad one (unusual), the author resisted the temptation to give us the happy ending.Rhett likes Scarlett both in spite of and because she is selfish, thoughtless, greedy, a bad mother, shallow, narrowminded, often ignorant and not wanting to learn anything, and lacking in self knowledge. She is also hypocritical, which is actually one of her good qualities. At least she acknowledges that there is something there in the world that is better than her, values superior to hers, characters better than hers, that she should at least pay lip service to. And it's not just lip service. She feels guilt and remorse. She wishes she was better. Let's not be too hard on hypocrisy. It keeps people from worse sins and it protects the innocent.What are her other good qualities? Determination, persistence, courage, shrewdness, resourcefulness, and loyalty to her family, and some notion of decency that keeps her from more seriously bad conduct.Rhett likes her. He finds her fascinating. He sees where she is vulnerable and loves her for that, too. He just wants that she would love him. But for her to do that she has to be a different person. Rhett falls into a classic trap, that the bad person will become good for the one that loves him. Scarlett is too foolish to realize what Rhett offers her, how valuable it is. One problem she has is not wanting to submit. He is willing to submit himself to the loved one, but she is not. She does not want to become dependent on anyone, seeing it as weakness. She is afraid of losing power. He will risk it but she won't.With Ashley, she will be the strong one. So she is not scared of Ashley. With Rhett, he is strong too. And he knows her and can see through her. That scares her. She can't put on airs with him. But Rhett although he teases her does not want to degrade her or change her, except to the extent she will love him. He is willing for her to go her own way. He just wants some honesty from her, so they can be comfortable together and have consensus, so they can get along day to day. He seeks it from the wrong person, however, because Scarlett is not honest about him, herself, or Ashley or Melanie. Rhett fails to see that a person like that cannot be honest with him either.Even at the end when she realizes it has been Rhett all along she still does not get it. She makes a contemptuous remark about Ashley. Rhett corrects her right away. No, he says, Ashley is not contemptible. Rhett is intelligent. He can respect things he does not share in or agree with. He can see the value of Ashley, though they are totally different characters. Scarlett, once she no longer is in love with Ashley, which she never really was, now despises him. She goes in the total opposite direction. That is typical of her and shows a small mind. It also shows that she never knew anything about Ashley. Rhett has a code of honor. Scarlett has no honor.Yet, we like her.If she was just a little more open minded she and Rhett would make a fine pair. If she could see Rhett for what he is, a ruthless harsh man with a code of honor and much kindness in him that he would lavish on her if given a chance. But she does not until it is too late and he has had it with her, with trying to give her love that she never would accept.It's one of the great love stories and the main reason, I believe, the book is still read.The other reason is the description of the old south and the reconstruction era. While I don't agree with all of the author's values, her writing is masterly. She makes you feel what those characters felt. She makes you sympathetic to people with totally different values from your own, which is no mean feat. The reader sees that the characters are wrong about slavery and race and the southern lifestyle, yet feels pity for them. The reader does not root for them to win, yet hopes that things will turn out well for them. When Rhett takes pains to ensure that his child will be accepted by the \"right\" kind of people, the old guard, you feel the same as he does, although you know that it is nonsensical. The old guard will die and it is well that it is so. But you admire Rhett for what he is doing. The book is a testament to the power of good writing, the power of art, the power of a good story. The book is compulsively readable. It is a good example of why we think art is dangerous.The author poured her passion into the book, the passion of the defeated south, and it all comes through on the page. Some parts of the book that go on and on about the south's wounds during reconstruction are tedious as well as historically not factual. For instance, it is not true that the freed slaves had all that power. But when she turns to what the characters feel, she makes you view them with sympathy, even love. The feelings in the book are genuine.",
            "My husband recently bought this copy for me when I showed him the copy I had one my book shelf... The one I have was printed in 1954. It had been read so many times that the spine was missing, pages were loose, some missing, pages stuck together, but I still kept reading it over and over.",
            "what I liked about gone with the wind:Lively description of pre- and post-civil war Southerners, mainly former plantation owners, who were left with no slaves and no money but still not surrendering.Scarlett O'Hara's bold way of overcoming the practical difficulties, even though it was sometimes unpleasant. But overall, to me, it was persuasive.Description of Scarlett's personality was really good and consistent. Thoroughly shallow and thorougly immature. (If there is any doctor or medical student in your family, please go and read about chapter of personality disorders in psychology book. I think Scarlett falls under the category of histrionic personality, as far as I can remember.)Other characters are also well pictured and attractive.Using Belle Watling as contrast to Scarlett, and also Melanie as contrast. Maybe Melanie would have made a better heroine.The end. I guess Scarlett cannot deserve an innocent happy end, but it was good to see that she recognized the truth about Ashley and Rhett at last, ironically via Melanie's death.what I hated about it:Justifying racism, especially KKK. Mitchell's point of view was really disturbing, even after making allowances for her as a pre-war Southerner from heart. OK, Scarlett was the heroine and she might have felt and thought that way pretty much. So Mitchell sticked to it.I agree that the significance of Civil War cannot be reduced to only one point, slavery issue, but Mitchell advocated for plantation owners too much.Rhett made peace with Southerners too easily, while with Bonnie. Also too romantically.Overall, it was good reading, but a little too romantic and inaccurate after all. Good mix of history and romance. If it were for only one of them, it would not have made such a hit. Plus, the force of characters. Mitchell did the best job about characters.",
            "Overall Rating: B+Like all books for which I see a movie adaptation first, I feel as though I was somewhat tainted by the movie. The book is similar though there are some discrepancies in the plot. These details (Scarlett O'Hara's other children by Charles Hamilton and Frank Kennedy, Will Benteen's involvement in Tara, etc) were good deletions from the book for the purposes of the movie production but, like all book to movie transformations, the extra details add an enormous amount of depth to the story.The prose is descriptive but, in parts, not as grand as I expected. Again, perhaps this is the taint from the movie but because the film was so beautifully produced, I expected the same feeling of grandeur from the text.Scarlett O'Hara is an incredibly interesting character; she comes off as a heartless and greedy but also shows an immense amount of passion. She isn't a likable character in most aspects but she does inspire a good amount of admiration for overcoming circumstances well beyond her control. Men play only a passing role for the most part; Rhett Butler is probably the most well developed male character but even he is predictable. Melanie Wilkes is the most pleasant surprise, showing more strength of will than was even broached by the movie. This is most certainly a character driven novel as there are long stretches of time in which very little action happens; on the other hand, there is so much to digest in the last few chapters I felt as though I was always a little behind.There are a few sequels/alternate story lines but, honestly, I'm not interested in the least. I enjoyed the story but it didn't inspire the obsession for me that it has for others.I always try to appreciate the context of language and story when I'm reading story set in another time. That being said, I couldn't help but cringe at the blatant racism displayed in a matter-of-fact way in the story. Racial epithets are frequent throughout the book and the ignorance and idiocy of the slaves/former slaves is taken at a given. This isn't to say it isn't an important part of the book as it was the sentiment of the times but, still, a little hard to listen to at times.I would recommend this to anyone who has a great love of the movie or for those who enjoy long, sweeping epics. In audiobook form, its an enjoyable listen but it is quite a slog.Audiobook Details:The reader, Linda Stephens, had a good balance of accents (she even sings the songs included in the book) and voice depth for the male characters. As much as I enjoyed her reading, the length of the book was so long it would have been refreshing to hear a few other voices. The number of characters in the book is small enough that this would have been an excellent cast production.I didn't recognize any of her other work but I would recommend her as a reader if you enjoy obvious voice acting.Run time was 49 hours, 7 minutes.Published By Recorded Books",
            "This book is wonderful! In history classes we always heard the Civil War from the North's perspective but this book gives us a glimpse into the South's feelings and the changes undergone there. But my favorite part about this book is the descriptions, the plot, the well-developed characters, the language of the times, and especially Scarlett herself. You won't be sorry you read it!",
            "Some of the reviews are long but I will keep this short. Gone With the Wind is the only book I have read twice. I absolutely adored this book and all the characters in it. It is my favourite book of all time and I read all sorts. I bought my mother and sister-in-law a copy because I thought they should read it too (just once). Read it and see for yourself.",
            "I first read this novel the summer I was seventeen. It is a novel that has been handed down in my family for three generations -- and now I know why.Scarlett O'Hara is a spoilt flirtacious southern belle on her father's rich plantation. All the other girls in the county hate and depise her because she has a way of getting her charming claws into their men -- ALL of the men, that is, except \"the long suffering Mr. Wilkes.\"Ashley Wilkes is young, blonde, handsome -- and taken. He is destined to marry Melony Hamilton -- the only woman in the county besides Scarlett's mother who doesn't depise her (ironically enough).Scarlett convinces herself she is in love with Ashley Wilkes, but the truth is she only wants him for the simple reason that she can not have him. Her want becomes an obsession that spans over the next four years of the Civil War and even after. Ashley turns her down in more than one entertaining love scene, one of which is over heard by none other than the the famous Rhett Butler.Rhett Butler is smitten by Scarlett the moment he first sees her because he recognizes in her the same qualities he values in himself: he is a social outcast without clean spot on his reputation. According to the South's unwritten social laws, he is not a gentleman but a scallywag and a cad because he refused to marry a girl he'd taken out without a chaperon. But Rhett is fearless and defiant when it comes to social rules and lives a comfortable life safely outside of \"good\" Southern society which means he openly associates with prostitues and therefore, knows about women's undergarments (something a man is supposed to pretend not to know about).But Rhett's sudden and adrent spark of love for Scarlett is doused somewhat when he learns of Scarlett's apparent love for Ashley Wilkes. He then spends the greater part of the novel fruitlessly pursuing Scarlett and trying to make her forget about Ashley. He married her, saying with a laugh that he \"can't wait all his life to catch her between husbands.\" But Rhett soon finds after the birth of their first child that married life with Scarlett is hell. He can't make love to Scarlett knowing that she's sighing for Ashley Wilkes, and he can't bear to sit across from her at supper anymore knowing that she wants Ashley there. And when Scarlett turns Rhett from her bed it hurts him so that he's driven to mad drinking.And though Scarlett moons after Ashley and fantasizes about him, she slowly but surely falls in love with Rhett. But here's the twist: once Scarlett realizes her love for Rhett and runs to him to proclaim it, she finds that Rhett's deathless love has, well, died, and that he just doesn't \"give a damn\" anymore.This is probably my favorite part of the movie version. I love when Scarlett runs through the mist to find Rhett at home, sitting listlessly before the window with an open suit case on the bed. I must've watched the ending more times than the rest of the movie put together. But nothing moves me more than Scarlett and Rhett's last parting words:\"Rhett! If you go, where shall I go, what shall I do?\"\"Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.\"",
            "THIS IS MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE NOVEL!! I don't care if I sound obsessed; I AM! Sure, I could offer the same criticism that others give (Mitchell was racist, Scarlett was a brat, the ending stunk), but regardless. I'm looking at the bigger picture here. WHAT A SAGA.Scarlett--though I admit, she was a witch sometimes---is truly admirable. She personifies the concepts of tenacity and perseverence, refusing to give up. I look up to her for being fierce, strong, opinionated, and a feminist. She was brave and ardent, and I love her.I forgive Mitchell for being racist in her writings, because she was most accurately portraying that time period. Honestly, I forgive any fault of the book, it was just so good!The conclusion...eh. I would have ended it at the end of the second-to-last chapter. But I'm not the author, I have no room to talk. She did a brilliant job illustrating the lives of members of the Confederacy, so lets give her proper credit and not denounce her.What else is there to say? These online reviews couldn't encompass it all, BY FAR. The novel was just delicious. I ate it all in less than two months' time (and it's a hearty meal, believe me). It surpasses the movie in my opinion, but both are exquisite masterpieces. READ IT READ IT READ IT READ IT!",
            "Gone With The Wind. Those immortal words are etched into the brains of generations. With those words come the acclaim and popularity it earned. To me, it was nothing more than a book. The swriting style of Margaret Mitchell is wonderful and I think that she brings authenticity to her work. That and only that is why i gave it four stars. Many of my female peers fell in love with the book. Maybe it was meant to be a feminine novel, not written for the eyes of a young man such as myself. It took me longer than most books to read and when I had finished it it left me with no sense of awe or despair at not having a decent sequel(which I am told is terrible). No, it left my with only one thought &quot;I wonder if I wasted my time.&quot;The story follows the majority of the life of Scarlett O' Hara, a ruthless southern belle, whose dellusions of love lead her to keep her foothold in the world. During her travels (or should I say misadventures?), she comes across a man named Rhett Butler. Rhett is a smart, dark, and deceptive character who flaunts his wealth and charm. He would have to be my favourite character because, as is so uncommon tday in literature, his character was believable and dark. His openness with his shortcomings and his lifestyle give him a sense of nonchalance that is a credit to Mitchell's style. However this is where my enjoyment stopped. The story seemed to drag unnecessarily and I did not speed through it as I thought I would when i heard how &quot;wonderful&quot; it was. The storyline was relatively simple and easy to understand, but it just does not gain my utmost appreciation as a classic in literature.",
            "This is the most absolutely wonderful book that was ever written! Margaret Mitchell truly makes you feel as if you were living in the Old South. This timeless novel has absolutely everything and anything that you could want in book- danger, fantasy, nightmares, dreams, lost loves, romances, daring heroines and heroes, villains, beauty, history, architecture, culture,... I could go on forever! I fell in love with Scarlett and Rhett the first time I read it. Yeah for the Confederacy!",
            "Gone With The Wind gives whoever reads it a very good story but it also teaches you a lot about the Civil War. The story starts at the beginning of the Civil War and it follows the life of Scarlett O'Hara for around 12 years. She is 16 at the beginning of the book.For about ten years of her life she thinks she loves Ashley Wilkes, only to realize that she had never loved Ashely and had tricked herself into thinking she did. At the beginning she tries to get Ashley to marry her instead of his fiance, when he doesn't, she marries Charles Hamilton.Throughout the story she and everyone around her loses everything that was dear to them. Almost everyone lost immediate family members in the war and Scarlett's mother , Ellen died from a fever and her father died after being crazy following Ellen's death. Scarlett struggled for a long time trying to keep her plantation, Tara, together. Scarlett and her family nearly starve for a long time until a man named Will helped them with the farming.Then, Scarlett married her sister's fiance for his money. He died a short while after. The night after his death, Rhett Butler, a man that the town hates because he was a scalawag, asked Scarlett to marry him. After a while she said yes. Within a few years, Scarlett gives birth to a baby girl and Rhett Butler loves her more than anything else. Scarlett loves her, but she never shows it, so Rhett raised Bonnie one his own. Everything is fine until it takes a turn for the worse. Bonnie dies and Melanie Wilkes, Ashley's wife dies. It was then that Scarlett realized how much she loved Melanie and it was then that she finally got her life straightened out.Overall, I think that Gone With The Wind is and excellent book. I would recommend it to highschool students.",
            "What else can be said about this great American epic? The classic coming of age book for many girls here in the South when they turn thirteen, it contains the whole story of the War Between the States amid a compelling love story. You will be glad when you read the book that you don't live in a time when you had to be in mourning for seven years. But, you will miss the era when honor, cause, and respect where such important issues.",
            "Even my husband enjoyed this one! This novel is the perfect combination of romance and action! If you have only seen the movie you haven't gotten the rest of the story! Once you read this one you will be hooked and Scarlett will have to be next! Enjoy!",
            "Gone With The Wind the American classic is a story of love and war in the 1860's. The main character Scarlett O'Hara was a bold women who fought the hardships of the war and also putting up with the man who infuriated her the most Rhett Butler. Rhett Butler was a rich man from Charleston who fell in love with Scarlett during the war. He also had a opinion about everything which Scarlett hated because she was very hot tempered. An incident in the book that made Scarlett my favorite character and also why I like the book so much was when Rhett Butler left her, Mammy and Melanie in the middle of the road when they were going back to Tara from Atlanta.The reason I liked this part so much was she didn't give up and she told Rhett how she felt and how she hated him for doing that. In those days girls really couldn't say their opinions but she did it any ways and showed she was strong . She was very determind to get what she wanted and she did. I really liked this book for many reasons. It gave you a description of how the war really was and it made you realize what they went through when they fought the war. Another reason I liked the book was the characters. Scarlett was a good example because she was a very lively character.Also Rhett Butler he was very good because he was very mysterious and you never knew what he would do next. I would recommend this book to people of all ages. The reason i think this is because it is a great love story and it gives you a understanding of how the war was really . I would defitnetly read this book again.",
            "Me being 11yrs. old didn't think that I would like this book. Boy was I wrong. This is my favorite book of all time! The only thing that I didn't like about the book which I know almost everybody will agree with me on is that it ends so suddenly not even giving you a hint to the outcome. Margaret Mitchell is so good that she can even capture an eleven yr. olds mind with an adult book. This book is easy to put people you know in the characters spots and just sit there all day and daydream a new ending. Did I mention that I loved this book?",
            "This book is truly a part of my soul...it's my favorite & I absolutely love it! Five is not enough stars!",

            "This book sold 4 Million copies in one week! Then it was made into a movie which stayed in theaters for 30 years. No story ever told can compete with this one. It is just as compelling now as it was all those years ago and will remain so indefinitely.",

            "I am torn. Half of the time I love the intricate characters and the relatonships between them and how it is all so skillfully braided together by a master wordsmith. I have trouble believig it was her first published one. A few flaws like too much obvious foreshadowing of one or two events but truly literature. Half the time I feel like shaking the chracters and the author for the blind racism that was breathed in like the air. That is why I gave this nook only four stars. Yet I would recommend including it in reading for college age or above as and example of these attitudes but accompanied by works of African American author covering the same historical period.",
            "I read &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; when my friends were reading the sequel. It was definitely the best book I've read yet. I'm reading the sequel, &quot;Scarlett&quot; now and all the characters seem so real. I got angry at Rhett when he left Scarlett, I cried when Melanie died. If you've never read it, read it soon!",
            "Best book of all time. Period.",
            "This book has everything that is needed for a great work of literature. The characters are compelling and believable, the plot and setting are exciting, and the language is just flowery enough to set off the book nicely. Scarlett is a vivacious character, and although I don't really respect or admire her I think she has a monolithic personality. I am so different from her that I find her reactions to the various situations she encounters highly entertaining. My favorite character is Melanie, because she is so like me. I can believe what she says and does and understand her because I would do the same thing usually. Rhett Butler gets on my nerves, though I think he's supposed to. He switches between acting gentlemanly and being a scoundrel. He doesn't know how to treat a lady-- or rather, a woman who isn't exactly a lady. The other characters I don't pay as much attention to, but I enjoy reading about every one of them. One of my first reactions to this book was that it really is perfect for a movie. Some of the descriptions paint a detailed and beautiful picture in my mind, and I read parts of them over and over. I haven't quite finished the book yet, but I have already recommended it to most of my friends, and I shall think of it as one of the greatest-- if not the best-- books I have ever read.",
            "This book is wonderful! It is the best classic ever written! Scarlett, a young lady growing up during the Civil War, struggles through many things. The hardships she faces are unbeleiveable! She has three husbands- Hamilton, Kennedy, and Butler. SHe ends up divorcing them all. There are many sad events in the bood, but there are also some happy moments. This book is a must read!",
            "Without a doubt, the best book ever written. I really felt like I was there, no, not even- I felt like I was her. I could understand what she thought, and would say, even if i thought she was a horribly selfish, blind little fool. The only real merits she had was being able to stick to something and get it, and to survive awful things. I was embarrassed for her,I could see the love that Rhett had held out to her, and wished I could tell her before she ruined the lives of everyone around her, not only herself. I felt the love that Melly had for her, and I wished I could be like Melly. The first 5 times I read it,in 7th grade, I cried really hard. Now, in 9th grade, I'm still it's biggest fan. My friends all think I'm obsessed, and maybe I am, but I love this book!!. Alexandra Ripley never should have tried to write a sequel, because it didn't match the facts, or what we knew of the characters. Scarlett may have chased after Rhett, without a doubt that's what she'd do, but she wouldn't go and have affairs with people, and Rhett wouldn't have married Anne. Anyway, what I'm trying to say, is that this is the best book, anyone who hasn't read it is missing out, and anyone who didn't like it is crazy!",
            "This is the best , I live in the south and I get very upset when I hear people say ,oh that book just show's what slavery was all about . That is when you know that, they have not read it. You would have to blind to not know that it's all about a very strong woman. It's wonderfully written .",
            "When I was twelve, I approached Gone with the Wind with reverence because I had repeatedly heard that it was the best novel ever written. A few days later, I closed the book on the last page, and all I felt was letdown. This is perhaps the greatest danger to succumbing to hype.Gone with the Wind is interesting and certainly very readable (I've read it several times since). Scarlett O'Hara is like Becky Sharp, mostly unlikeable, but still admirable for her gutsiness.While reading the book, it began to dawn on me that most of the gush over Gone with the Wind that I'd heard was about the movie rather than the book itself. I went to see the movie. I was appalled; the casting of the four main characters just didn't seem to fit. I already had a fixed notion in my mind of what the characters were like so probably no actors could meet my expectations. If I had read the book or seen the movie without any expectations, possibly I would've liked them better.",
            "Gone With the wind is a beautiful story about love,perseverence, and a woman's determined mind accompanied by an undecided heart, in a story where she learns to grow and fight through hardships, as she matures and prospers during the civil war.",
            "At times the book vvas tedious and i had the urge to skip pages, vvhich i did. i felt that at parts she dragged the story out too much; parts vvhere she used a page or tvvo to describe vvhat the day looked like or vvhat furnishings vvere contained in a room; these vveren't necessary. i like to knovv the setting of the story, but a vvhole page dedicated to descriptions? hmm...Despite this i really enjoyed the story. it offered a different point of vievv of the civil vvar. the pros and cons of slavery. it vvas interesting. i found that i liked the characters: scarlett and rhett..*smiles* they vvere memorable. very endearing characters.It vvas a romance story that rather sticks in my mind. the story vvas about scarlett and her life..yeha it sounds boring and at times it vvas but...read it. you might like it. just give it a try (read the vvhole book) and then decide if u like it or not. but don't read the story if the only reason is because someone or you yourself forced you to read it. u'll probably hate it if u do.Someday vvhen i've forgotten most of the details of the book i might reread it, but for novv i'll go back to my vampire chronicles.enjoy",
            "I agree with many reviewers that the book is an interesting, engrossing novel. The character development and descriptions are very good, and Mitchell does a good job of describing the motives that drive the characters. I also appreciated the fact that Mitchell did not write a typical &quot;happily ever after&quot; ending. However, I find it disturbing that very few reviewers noticed or commented on the extreme racism in the book. If you believe Mitchell's description of the KKK, you would never know that this was a racist, terrorist organization (and still is). Also, according to Mitchell, only &quot;trashy&quot; black people wanted freedom; the &quot;quality&quot; black people wanted to remain slaves!! These are obviously Mitchell's views of black people, and not just the characters' views. Mitchell took pains to write that not all Yankees were bad and that many were ashamed of the corrupt reconstructionist government they had to uphold. In a biography of Mitchell's life, she is described as refusing to attend a class with a black student who has been admitted to her college. I only hope that most readers noted her obviously racist views and realize that slavery was not as she described it.",
            "I remember seeing this film about 40 years ago in Las Vegas. It was showing at the Las Vegas Cinerama next to the old Bonanza Hotel. It took me a couple weeks to read this book, but I really enjoyed it. Mitchell's depiction of the South after Civil War was very accurate as some of my family was from Arkansas and Mississippi so I have some idea of what that mindset was. This is a book that I will probably read i again sometime. I also found that ordering a used book through other dealers via Amazon was very effective and very easy. I will certainly use this service again.",
            "My sister recommended this book to me, saying that \"it was the best book she has ever read\". I knew that this book was amazing, judging from what my family has told me for so long, but I didn't want to read it for one reason that reason being, \"the book is over 1000 pages!!!\" So it's been lying on my shelf for more than a few years until I finally decided to read it. It took me 2 weeks to read (whereas it took my sister 5 days) it and boy, did I have an amazing time reading about Scarlett, her family, Tara, Captain Rhett Butler, Ashley Wilkes, and every body. I especially enjoyed the Southerners points of view about slavery. After readin historical books, all from the Union's point of view, I realized that I've been missing out on a lot of info on the Civil War. I've always thought that Southerners treated their slaves with cruelty, based on what I've read from other histocial fiction books, but after reading this one, I found out that slavery wasn't all about whippings, beatings, and any other kind is mismanagement.Scarlett has to be my favorite character. She is headstrong and stubborn, yes, but she fights for what she believes in and does everything to save Tara, even if it meant hurting family members. This books was dramatic, however, such as whatever someone gained, someone else loses something that is very dear to them but I guess that adds more \"zest\" to the whole story.This is, \"the best book I have ever read in my life\". Well at least in my 14 years of living. If you have the slightest interest in reading this wonderful, enchanting classic, go ahead. I did and I don't regret it.",
            "Wonderful story!! Margaret Mitchell did an amazing job in her research to make this book as accurate as possible. This is one of my favoritr books!",
            "As it always has, GWTW sweeps you up in its story about a woman who faces down adversity and never blinks. Scarlett may have flaws, but when trouble comes, she's the one everyone turns to for answers, and she's the one who has solutions. For many women, especially myself,it's still the most compelling American novel of all time.",
            "I had already read this book, I just reread it because i needed to add it to my kindle. Remains to this day my favorite book!",
            "Absolutely beautiful antique book. Crisp pages, tight binding, and that \"old musty book\" smell well all love. Couldn't be more happy with the service and speed of delivery. Love it!",
            "I remember going to the old Orpheum Theater with my mother and my best friend to see \"Gone With the Wind\" 'in the summer of 1969. I was so excited to see my first grown up film. I can see the maroon curtains unveiling the movie screen as the lights dimmed. Not a sound could be heard, but the opening strains of music and there was Tara! I was smitten. Laura and I sat through the second showing too. Exhausted, but roiled up was I when I got home. On my lonely supper plate laid my very first copy of Margaret Mitchell's GONE WITH THE WIND! Needless to say, I wolfed down supper and went to my room and began reading the book that I've had a love affair with since that summer day.With each reading I notice something I've missed in prior readings. I still find Slavery to be the abomination as it has always been. And it must have been harder to read about a mere 75 years after the end of the Civil War in 1936 when GONE WITH THE WIND was first published. I'm not surprised that this epic historical novel won the Pulitzer Prize in 1937. Mitchell has created a multitude cast of characters, giving each their own distinct voice. The reader can tell the difference between Pork, Mammy, Prissy, and Uncle Peter and that is credit to Mitchell. But even minor characters sound different. Tara, Twelve Oaks, and Atlanta also become fascinating characters too. As Tara represents the ability to change as the new South rises in defeat of its old genteel feudal life style where every man, women, and child are free to live as they want. Twelve Oaks reflects the Old South that is forever torn asunder. It is Ashley's South. He doesn't fit in with the change. He and Melanie are perfect for each other. She understands him and the dream that was the Old South.Rhett Butler hates that Old South because it tossed him out and turned its back on him. His bitterness fuels his pleasure as he sees its demise as Atlanta burns and his pockets are full of Gold. He is the most transformed character in GONE WITH THE WIND. I'd never observed his transformation as I did in this reading. No wonder the 35 year old fell for the fiery self willed 16 year old Scarlett O'Hara. Not only is she spirited, she possess a dogged determination of those who seem to get their way most of the time. It is Scarlett whom Aunt Pitty and Melanie feel safe in the absence of a man in their Atlanta household. It is Scarlett who makes sure her kith and kin are safe, housed, and fed. She tells us that she'll never be hungry again no matter if she has to cheat, steal, or commit murder. So it's no surprise that she marries for convenience after she had married to make Ashley miserable and silence wagging tongues at Twelve Oaks. I felt sorry for her boys; she really was a mother only to her precious Bonnie. And how on Earth could she have loved a wuss like Ashley Wilkes when she had a grown man who loved her? I'd like to think that Scarlett O'Hara Hamilton Kennedy Butler got her man back after she returns to Tara. The land always gives her strength and regenerates her spirits. But I wonder if she realized too late that she loved Rhett and really belonged with him? Well after all, tomorrow is another day.",
            "I bought it for my kindle, because its summer and there will probably never be a better beach read or a better book ever anyway. Scarlett still steals your breath with her personality and Rhett still makes you swoon and this is still the best book I ever read.",
            "When I began this book, I began something that I didn't know how to end. I began a journey, and as this journey came to a close, I nearly came unravelled at the seams. I'm serious. This book is ruining my life a little bit right now, and I'm just not sure what my refractory period is after finishing a truly, devastatingly good novel that also breaks my heart.I will say this as a foreward to a very long and very emotional review- this book is quite problematic for me and I'm sure for many others as well. I am a girl born and raised in the North and there are some things, even fictional things, that I am uncomfortable with. That's just who I am. I absolutely applaud Mitchell on this masterpiece, but I also raise an eyebrow at her. There are offensive things in this book, mind you, and it takes awhile to get past them.We all know the basics of this 1,000 page Bildungsroman. Scarlett O'Hara, sixteen years old, the charming Southern Belle on her plantation Tara, blissfully ignorant and delightfully simple, devoted to her one true love, Ashley Wilkes, while courting several other \"beaux\" and enjoying her sweet life. Then the war comes, and then Ashley marries, then Rhett Butler appears, and suddenly, the novel begins, and I was swept away by its tide so fast I didn't know what hit me.My first reaction to Scarlett was overwhelmingly negative, which I'm sure is the common reaction. She is just so overwhelmingly simple. She cannot grasp scarcasm or irony or metaphor, she hates books, and she detests any talk of politics. And she prefers the chaste and simpering affection of men to any kind of female companionship, save for the love of her precious and doting mother Ellen. And for some unfathomable reason, she is absolutely devoted to Ashley Wilkes, a sappy pretty boy who is already engaged to be married. Scarlett is the protagonist I usually shut the book for. I don't identify with her, nor did I originally want to. She was cute, sure, and I was swept away by her first dance with Rhett, but I still didn't like her. Then, about 200 pages in, she becomes a heroine.I will always consider Scarlett O'Hara one of the bravest women I've ever read. She is strong, she is willful, and she does what needs to be done, no matter how unsuited she is for the job. When she had to help Melanie Wilkes give birth, sweet little Melanie whom Scarlett hated with fire, amidst burning Atlanta, I was on the edge of my seat. When she was abandoned by Rhett and had to fend for herself, Melanie, the baby, and her child, she just fought, and she survived. And I felt like there was hope for the rest of the story.Not only was Scarlett a heroine, she was a clever one. She married her second husband for money and used that money to make more money for herself, while presenting herself in \"unladylike\" ways, such as -gasp- leaving the house while pregnant! Quelle horreur! I loved this part because it wasn't just cheesy romance or adventure, it was relevant and interesting and very smart. Scarlett was blossoming, maybe not to others as much as she as to me. She was beginning to grow so multi-faceted. Now I have this strong, brave, brilliant woman, and what does she do? She breaks my little heart. All because of Rhett Butler.Rhett Butler was a conflicting character for me. To most women, he's a god. He's manly, rough, and a little dirty, but he also tries to know what women want and he loves hard and deep. But he's kind of a jerk and I go back and forth between loving and hating him. He doesn't take Scarlett seriously and he seems to think too highly of her reasoning skills, and I don't think those two ever really knew each other at all. Not to mention the fact that he probably raped her. He does redeem himself at the end, at least he mostly does, and then my heart ached so bad and I wanted things to be different so badly. I felt like I was the one who'd lost my chance. I was the one who didn't get my love, not Scarlett or Rhett. I hurt for them, for the evils they saw, for the harshness they lived, for the children and friends and family they lost. I was brought close to them and then I was torn apart. Mitchell made me love what could have been, and then when it wasn't, it was a loss that I am still recovering from.There are so many characters you fall in love with in this novel. Scarlett is probably one of the most multi-faceted characters I've ever read, and I think I love her. She is cold, powerful, manipulative, spiteful, delusional, childish, and shameless, but she is also hardworking, stubborn, idealistic, charming, hopeful, sensical, practical, and intensely brave. She grows in some ways and stays the same in others. She knows how to get what she wants and she knows how to stand up for herself, but when she learns a lesson, she learns it too late, and I just want to shake her. She is infuriating, but she is also infuriatingly real, and I will never forget her.Melanie is another character I will never forget. Her sheer devotion and faith and loyalty to Scarlett is achingly bittersweet, since she is used like Scarlett's puppet, but the scene of her death killed me. That is the only time Scarlett states her outward affection for Melanie and it was perfect. The bond they had was really interesting. I loved Will Benteen and Aunt Pitty and little Bonnie Butler.Now let me discuss why I am hesitant to discuss this novel with everyone. \"Gone With the Wind\" is unfathomably racist. I don't care if it was set in a time period. I don't care if it was the environment or the social commentary or even if Margaret Mitchell was racist or not, the language and characterization of the black slaves in Georgia is REALLY offensive. Like Alice Walker has said, white people use the altered way of writing a black person's speech to highlight that they truly know better and that it only makes the black characters look silly and uneducated. In novels with British characters, we don't use different spellings or exaggerated syntax. I HATE when white writers do that. It is embarrassing. I don't like it when people say that this novel was telling the story of the \"real south\", because it doesn't matter if it is real or not, it doesn't need to be glamorized. I'm glad Mammy is such a devoted person. I'm glad Pork is so proud of himself. But I hate that it is somehow attached to their status as slaves.Also, I'm pretty sure Rhett raped Scarlett. She ended up melting into him and enjoying his attention, but he would've done it whether she melted or not. I know that and I think Mitchell knew that. It makes it hard to love Rhett, but then again, there isn't an unconflicted character in this novel.Is this book problematic? Oh, yes. I completely understand the criticism and I won't hesitate to criticize it myself. But sometimes, problematic literature is also beautiful, and well-written, and emotional, and touching. This is one of those books. I will never forget this story. I am changed by it. I was reading it last night and when I read the part after Scarlett fell down the stairs and she calls for Melly but Melly can't come because Rhett is crying in her lap, I started crying. I really was crying because it was too much, and this is what the book does to your life when you set out on the journey to read it. Take the journey but pack a lot of provisions, and keep your mind open but sharpened, and let yourself enjoy it while still taking the time to think and reflect.Now, because I just have to- The girl I was before I read \"Gone With the Wind\" is truly gone with the wind.",
            "I read Gone with the Wind many years ago, so it was a pleasure to read it again. I only gave it 4 stars because I almost always wanted to have a \"talk\" with Scarlett. I am so glad she \"grew up\" finally at the end... a little too late, but better late than never. I loved the history that Mitchell sprinkles through the book. I also enjoyed seeing how some things never change. Such a pleasure to read.",
            "I actually read this book. Hard to believe because I'm not used to being bombarded with great detail and historical happenings. Not into it really. But this book was hard to put down. It was slow reading because the detail had me visualizing so much that I had to re-read a lot of passages but when I finally got through it, it was well worth the journey. Highly recommended.",
            "I first read this book when I was in 8th grade. It was for a reading program. I don't remember how long it took me to read it, but I remember thinking it was the greatest book I ever read. I have often tried to convince my friends to read it, but because of its length, they refuse. Let me tell you, the story of Scarlett and Rhett is one of the best out there. It was beautifully written by Mitchell, her descriptions of the characters are extremely vivid as if you are right there in the book with them. I recommend this book for everyone, whether or not this is your type of book. Every page will draw you closer to it and the life it shows. But ever since I have read this book, I've read it at least 3 more times since then. And it always takes me by surprise and pulls me along with it.",
            "As an author with my first novel in its initial release, I am amazed at my recent rereading of GONE WITH THE WIND. I find it hard to believe (though I've known it forever) that GONE WITH THE WIND was Margaret Mitchell's first novel. She pulled it all together here with strong characters, a remarkable plot, and fabulous writing centered around the crucial event in American history. This novel, we all know the story, has become a foundation of American culture. It deserves to be. Read this novel, or read it again, if you haven't for awhile.",
            "When I read Margaret Mitchell's classic &quot;Gone With the Wind,&quot; I was in the eighth grade and as impressionable as a young teen can be. It was my favorite for a long time, and I can still pick it up and reread it without getting bored. A cousin really loves it too, or I thought she did till I learned she loves the movie and had never read the novel. Well! She's read it now, and discovered that not only did Scarlett have other children, she also has ways and feelings you'd never know from the film alone.One example is the maid in the O'Hara household named Mammy. Though she is indeed in the movie, she is a much rounder character in the novel. On her deathbed, Scarlett stays by her side unselfishly, nursing her to the end. Other slave characters are more prominent in the novel also, such as some that move and marry. Vivian Leigh did justice to her role, as did all the others, but still, all pale in comparison to the depths they possess in the book.Screenplays are so different to read than novels that they don't seem to compare either. Sometimes a novel reads so visually that you believe the author had a film version in mind when writing it. One that struck me as such recently was &quot;The Horse Whisperer.&quot;The opening scenes with the girls on horseback, the slow-motion effect of the wreck, all of it, was like watching a movie instead of reading a book. The ability to write this way may be a great talent that most don't possess.What are you thoughts on novels to film? I'd like to know. And, if you've never read your &quot;Gone With the Wind,&quot; try it today and see what you missed in that favorite of yours.",
            "I love books, and I love history. It seems that this book was a godsend for me! Wars have never interested me, the civil war, of course seemed like a no brainer: Yankees=good, Confederates=bad. But this book has made me realize that both sides suffered. It wasn't a no-brainer...it was difficult for everyone. Girls and boys, Women, Men, everyone! So many people suffered, and were hurt. This book is a wonderful mix of adventure, romance and history, weaved together to make one of the best books of all time.",
            "I first read this book, 2 years ago, in 6th grade and loved it. This is one of the best books I'v read, along with Little Women. I love reading books about the past. The caracters were very different from most books. They wern't perfect. I also loved how Scarlett could get any man she wanted ,and did, with the exception of Rhett. It had every thing a good book should have.",
            "I have never had the concentration to sit through the movie all in one go - but I found the book, all 1000+ pages of it, compelling. Other reviewers have commented on the amount of detail put into this book, which makes it all the more real. And we are forced to sympathise and feel for characters that behave in what those of us living in the year 2000 would regard as most sexist and racist behaviour. It really gives you some understanding of how people lived and regarded each other at that time, and the different class and race structures which existed, with interesting insights into the interactions between the people who owned plantations and the slaves who worked on them. And of course, we have the character of Scarlett to contend with - one of the most spoiled and most motivated heroines ever described. I wished so much for her to open her eyes and see what a waste of time Ashley was, and how much Rhett loved her, but she is too immature to realise all this. I am debating whether I should read 'Scarlett', the recently written sequel, or just imagine her living her life out with Suellen and Will, her children and her money. A sign of a great book is the way it stays with you long after you've read it, and I often find myself rethinking passages from this book. I would recommend it for anyone.",
            "I'm a 12 year old and a little while ago finished reading GWTW. It was my favorite movie for the longest time and I decided I wanted to read the book. All my friends bet I would never finish it but I did! It may be long but there was never a dull moment. Read this book or see the movie! Actually, do both!",
            "i am completely in love with the book Gone with the Wind! Mitchell does an amazing job at using such descriptiveness as to put you right there in the story. It kept me up for nights on end as i couldn't get enough of it. This book is full of amazing characters that you grow to love and to hate. My personal favorite, Rhett Butler, made my heart skip a beat every time his name was mentioned. It is an excellent civil war romance that i could read over and over again!",
            "Being a Yankee, I never got why so many white people in the South are STILL so bugged about the Civil War and its aftermath. Well, after reading this book, now I know: those ornery white people down there are descendents of Scarlett O'Hara and Melanie Wilkes (and all those tough old white ladies, the &quot;old cats,&quot; as Scarlett calls them) and by God they just ain't never gonna FORGET! Every American (especially all you Yankees) should read this book for a better understanding of the point of view of rich white Southerners during and after the Civil War. (You still won't think they were RIGHT, by the way, but you'll understand them.) Plus, Scarlett O'Hara is a total piece of work. You've gotta get a load of all the stuff she's up to! This is a chick who could rule the freakin' world!",
            "This book has created intriguing characters. But the main characters like Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett are admired and glorified to a fault. Scarlett O'Hara is tough, practical and no-nonsense. But in essence, she's a villain with these qualities. She steals her own sister's boyfriend, emotionally abuses her children, marries men for money and spite, and cheats on everyone and anyone. Seems there's nothing she would not do for money and for herself. Surely she has certain qualities that are needed in a war to survive, but it's not the war that made her selfish to the core. It simply brings out her selfishness on a larger scale.",
            "I love this book. Scarlett is cunning and manipulative and sometimes ridiculous. But for all her flaws, she is a survivor and incredibly strong. Her story is beautiful, perfectly balanced and perfectly written.I so wish that Margaret Mitchell would have written more. Apparently one perfect book was enough for her, but it wasn't enough for generations of her fans!",
            "I've been pressured to read this book since about 5th grade. Everybody in my family has read it. I thought, \"What's so great about this huge book about the war? Boring.\" I finally picked it up this year. Definitely not boring.16 year old Scarlett O'Hara was not necessarily the most beautiful girl in Georgia, but her emerald eyes, 17 inch waist, and stubborn yet flirtatious attitude attracts all the men except Ashley Wilkes. The one man she thinks she truly wants. She has almost the perfect life; living on a huge plantation named Tara, and she's finally old enough to wear gorgeous dresses to various parties. She has the perfect slave, Mammy, keeping her in check throughout the story. Ashley has a party at his plantation, Twelve Oaks, to inform the town he is getting married to his cousin Melanie. Scarlett first puts on her flirt into overdrive to try to win him back, but when that doesn't work, she goes crazy breaking dishes and screaming while she should be upstairs napping with the other ladies. A mysterious man with a bad reputation just happened to be watching the whole thing. Rhett Butler. He was not intimidated by her like other men, he just laughed in amusement. But, the marriage does not stop Scarlett from getting what she wants. The Civil War doesn't either, it just greatly impairs it. Scarlett has to figure out how to live off of nothing and still keep her charm with the few men that are even around, not at war. She has to watch everything she loves break down to pieces before her own eyes; her family, Tara, and her wealth.Scarlett is such a brave character. She is a stubborn and selfish American heroine. She always says, \"I'll think about it later. After all, tomorrow is another day.\" This is an inspirational and true statement everybody should remember. People didn't know exactly how wonderful of life they had before the war, before they lost everything. I think all people experience this feeling. The knowledge that nothing will go back to the way it was. Miss Melly acts like nothing happened and hopes for the best. Scarlett on the other hand kept fighting herself and did things even a man wouldn't do to get her life back together again. She started her own business, married men for their money to help her family, and rode in carriages without an escort! That was scandalous and unheard of in the 1800s. It's the stubborn Irish coming out in her. She always wanted the best for herself. Not necessarily the people around her. But then there's Rhett who keeps popping up throughout the book giving Scarlett expensive gifts from Europe. Scarlett despises him for his smirks and smart attitude, but does she find she loves his sarcasm and money? Does she love him or hate him? You don't know until the last chapters.America was not joking when they voted Gone with the Wind as it's favorite novel. A classic. It's definitely a page turner. (All 1030 pages) You get a feeling of the other side of the Civil War. In history books the North was always the good guys. The Confederates hated the Yankees and their ways. I mean, who would want to have to free such devoted and motherly slaves like Mammy?This novel almost makes you mad because it doesn't go the way it's supposed to be. They should go back to being rich and happy! You want to pop into the book and get things all straightened out so it can be a happily ever after ending.I loved Gone with the Wind for many reasons. First of all, it made me realize that people in the old days were just the same as they are now. The characters are so real and have real life thoughts. Scarlett thought, \"If I have to steal or kill - as God is my witness, I'm never going to be hungry again.\" The people are not saying the perfect things at the perfect time like most books. Also, I loved the side stories with Scarlett's sisters, Ashley's relationship, the war, Rhett, the babies, and Scarlett's determination. It truly is one of the best books out there.",
            "Why is this novel the second best selling book in the world? Because every character evokes deep emotion to the reader whether love or hate. The complexity of the personalities written by Mitchell is amazing in itself, but place on top of that a writing style that flows like poetry and you've got in your hands the most fun a person can have with paper. Vivid descriptions of the Southern landscape, the Old South traditions, the Southern gentility, and the graceful way of life pre-Civil War are second to none. I have lived in the South my whole life and much of the lifestyle Mitchell relates in GWTW are accurate and still exist in one form or fashion. The South is the only true culture left in America and this is a window into how it began and what it was like in its peak. Traditions die hard down here but they are dying fast, get romanced by life south of the Mason-Dixon before it gets washed away in a flood of \"progress\".",
            "If you've ever read any classic like Pride and Prejudice you will love this novel. My friend once mentioned this novel was fantastic so I got my hands on a copy. Boy was I surprised to see how long it was and how small the font was. But it was completely worth it in the end. Margeret Mitchell really gets the point through with her novel. All the characters, such as Scarlett, feel so real throughout the whole book and everything is so thoroughly explained that you feel like your actually there. I also enjoyed the history in the book because I'll soon be studying the Civil War at school and this novel really helped me understand it in an enjoyable way.There are also many timeless lessons that are valuable for anyone.So anyone who loves romance, don't mind how long the novel is because in the end it's worth it. I urge you to go out and buy a copy NOW. :>",
            "To put it simply, this is the best book ever written. you have not lived until you have conquered this masterpiece of prose. For some, the length is intimidating, but it goes fast, so dont use that excuse. This book is a romance novel, a war story, a documentary all roled into one. there is something here for everyone.While reading this book, I found myself wishing so badly to be more like Melanie. Unfortunately, I am more of a Scarlett myself. I suspect most readers, if they are to be honest, would also admit to this. Yes, she is cruel, materialistic, unyeilding and rather spoiled. No, she isnt one to be envied. But still, there is something about her that one cant help but relate to. perhaps its because we watch her grow from a careless young lady to a hardened, stubborn adult. We know her story. we know her hopes and her fears and what drives her so far, and we cant help but admit that if we were in her shoes, wouldnt we have a similar response? all the same, one feels very little sympathy for her in the end, as she loses everything that matters, and is left with nothing but her money.Rhett, as another reviewer said, is certainly the tragic figure in this story. He is ultimately driven to accept the lifestyle that was originally so repulsive to him and that he worked so hard to avoid. ah, but for some there is some pride to be found in not being recieved! He loves Scarlett so much, yet due to her blindness to her own emotions, and the general reservations between them, their marriage fails. He tries to pour all the love and emotions he would otherwise show Scarlett onto Bonnie blue, but when she dies, there is nothing left for him. Its ironic, hes a big man, a strong man, a man to be afraid of...yet one almost cant help but to pity him.Great book.Read.",
            "Published in 1936, can any serious reader expect Gone With the Wind to mesh with 21st-century sensibilities? Of course not. Therefore, it may be wiser to open this book, put sensibilities aside, and let it rip because Gone With the Wind is simply a classic. Margaret Mitchell's Confederate sympathies hold little in the way of ambivalence. The dream-like plantation lifestyle, it's total devastation, and the abject humiliation of it's adherents under Reconstruction are starkly protrayed. Amidst the tragedy of civil war, Mitchell places a bevy of unforgettable characters whose inner strengths and weaknesses receive vivid definition - the interplay of which is truly sublime.Gone With the Wind is ultimately a story of traumatic loss and dogged perserverence, overcoming disaster, peeling oneself off of the cold, hard floor. To be sure, there is wicked condescension, biased justifications, premises so one-sided they defy belief, but through it all Gone With the Wind stands with Tolstoy's War and Peace in it's ability to bring the social costs of war to the surface in a manner both eloquent and disturbing. This book should be read by all. 5+ stars.",
            "GONE WITH THE WIND effortlessly uses the English language in ways I never thought possible, to tell the sweeping timeless story of a strong woman who stuck it out. People who say they don't like her are missing the point. Books are supposed to entertain, not preach. Scarlett may be selfish and stubborn and materialistic, but she is not boring. She lights up the pages with her vivacity. Give me an interesting heroine over a moral example any day.For more great books about Reconstruction in the South (and a girl who is in some ways exactly like Scarlett, and in others her polar opposite) go to littlecolonel.com and read the out-of-print Little Colonel series for free. Offers a new perspective on Scarlett's time.",
            "This is my favorite book of all time. Everyone should find time to read it. I realize it is 1024 pages of very small print and also that there are sixty-three chapters; however it is amazing. I realize too that it is in some cases a bit racist and there are people who are offended by that; to them, I privately say, \"Grow up\". Gone With the Wind is not about slavery. It is not about white supremacy. It is not even really about the South. It is about how war destroys people. You could take it and apply it to any war. I am by no means a white supremist, but those feelings need to be pushed aside while one enjoys such a wonderful book. I do not agree with Scarlett, or Melanie, or Ashley, or Rhett completely, but I can't help but tear up as I watch their world disappear again and again. It is a million times better than a history book to understand the causes of bigotry in the South after the war. As for Scarlett, she is infuriating, bullheaded, selfish, and childish, but I cannot help loving her anyway. Perhaps my favorite lines, though, come from Ashley, lost soul though he is:\"It's a curse--this not wanting to look on naked realities. Until the war, life was never more real to me than a shadow show on a curtain. And I preferred it so. I do not like the outlines of things to be too sharp. I like them gently blurred, a little hazy...It isn't that I mind splitting logs here in the mud, but I do mind what it stands for. I do mind, very much, the loss of the beauty of the old life I loved. Scarlett, before the war, life was beautiful. There was a glamor to it, a perfection and a completeness and a symmetry to it like Grecian art. Maybe it wasn't so to everyone. I know that now. But to me, living at Twelve Oaks, there was a real beauty to living. I belonged in that life. I was a part of it. And now it is gone and I am out of place in this new life, and I am afraid. Now, I know that in the old days it was a shadow show I watched. I avoided everything which was not shadowy, people and situations which were too real, too vital. I resented their intrusion. I tried to avoid you too, Scarlett. You were too full of living and too real and I was cowardly enough to prefer shadows and dreams.\"Everytime Ashley says what he truly thinks, it makes me cry. I never cry about anything, but I cry over Gone With the Wind. It's not that I want to be a part of that world, the pre-Civil War South, because I don't...it's just that Margaret Mitchell's words are magic, creating characters so real that I can't help but long for them to have what they want.",
            "...into the ad hoc matriarch of a shattered plantation family. Scarlett O'Hara makes you wince at her infuriating shallowness earlier in the story. You can spot it in a conversation between herself and Ashley Wilkes, the man she wants to steal away from Melanie Hamilton. Ashley comments that Rhett Butler (who Scarlett has just seen for the first time) looks like one of the Borgias. Scarlett asks which family they are--she doesn't know them. Ashley patiently explains that they're Italians. \"Oh,\" says Scarlett dismissively. \"Foreigners.\" The type of prideful ignorance that my own working class demographic (\"crackers\" back in those days) expresses like this; \"I'm dumb as hell and proud of it.\" One thing the movie doesn't capture by a long shot with Vivien Leigh as Scarlett and Olivia DeHavilland as Melanie is that these girls are teenagers, antebellum \"valley girls\". So actually, what do you expect? Basically, Melanie beats Scarlett out for Ashley's affections becase she is nowhere near as immature. But Scarlett's father frequently comments on her \"willfulness\", possibly without realizing himself that it's a clue to a titanic courage in his firstborn. In the ensuing story, the Civil War grinds up people and land. Melanie, Scarlett's onetime despised rival, becomes dependent upon her. Ashley is destroyed in spirit as well--a rich dandy doesn't have the moxie to endure war when it lands in his backyard. The main reason Scarlett ends up getting involved with Rhett is that he's the only man with her level of guts. Scarlett reminds me of Pat Conroy's \"Great Santini\" character--at first you can't stand her, you thank God no one like her is close to you, but when the chips are down, she's a survivor. And people associated with her survive as well. One thing this book points out is that the ugliness of war is a force of human nature, and people who think themselves insulated from it, or \"above war's barbarism\" wind up finding out the hard way that they're dead wrong. Now if only our present-day sheltered middle class and \"thinking people\" could face that inescapable truth...",
            "\"Burdens are for shoulders strong enough to carry them\"Tara Plantation, near Jonesborough, near Atlanta, GeorgiaKatie \"Scarlett\" O'Hara is the most charming Southern belle, gathering the attention of beaux all over the surrounding areas. But when she learns the man she had been psuedo-courting, Ashley Wilkes, is marrying Melanie Hamilton from Atlanta, his cousin, she schemes to win him back. When he refuses, she immediately marries Charles Hamilton in spite. But Civil War has come to the South, and Scarlett quickly finds herself a widow, stuck in Atlanta, with a child, unable to be the pretty belle she had been a few months prior. Will Scarlett ever get Ashley? What about the strange Rhett Butler character, who is constantly tweaking her? Will Scarlett and her family survive the war?Let me preface my review with this: I don't read a lot of historical fiction or chick lit or romance or anything. My speciality is science fiction, fantasy, and urban fantasy. However, this book absolutely, positively blew me away!At first, I found the novel a bit slow. There were so many characters, and at first, it seemed like nothing happened. But that wasn't to last. Quickly, I became interested in Scarlett's schemes to snatch Ashley away from Melanie, all the while hating her for her bad behavior. By the end of the book, there were points were I was in near tears.Scarlett wasn't my favorite character. She was a rude, bitter, selfish woman. But I completely understood her predicament. To the reader, she was completely honest, despising her first husband's death (and life!), her dislike of children (don't see that much in romance do we!), her dislike of women's poor station (always having to act \"silly\" in front of the menfolk), and taking the reigns of business to make a life of her own. So while I didn't like her, I also didn't hate her. I understood what she was trying to do and found myself rooting for her against the odds. She is a brilliantly written character, so dynamic, multifaceted and full.Melanie Hamilton was probably my favorite character. This might seem odd as she does come off as a Mary Sue--perfect and sweet to everyone, always right, yada, yada--and I hate Mary Sues. But I really never found Melanie a Mary Sue. Scarlett repeatedly downplays Melanie's beauty. Melanie is strong-willed and works diligently, but tires easily (such as when she works at Tara in the cotton fields). Like Scarlett, Melanie was definitely not a 1-D character. She appeared weak on the outside, while maintaining strenght in the face of danger, in the face of childbirth, in the face of hard times. She was a true inspiration to me.Rhett Butler made me so furious, sometimes I wanted to slap him like Scarlett! But other times, he was so charming and debonair, that I wanted to melt in his arms like butter. I loved how forthright he was, how practical and realistic he was, and yet how at times, his passionate nature came through (joining the Confederate army at the end, for example).Side characters, such as Miss Pittypat, Mammy, Dilcey, Pork, Uncle Peter, Mrs. Meade, Belle Watling, and more, jumped out at me. They felt like real people, people influenced by dreams, desires, and feelings. Probably one of the sweetest moments was when Dr. and Mrs. Meade were talking and she mentioned she would rather him be at Belle's than dead. Given what Mrs. Meade had been through, what she held dear, it was particularly poignant.I could go on endlessly about the amazing life lessons and themes and symbols in the book. Quotes about the status of women at the time, about changing with the changing times, about strength of character, about being who you are, and about what is really important in life abound in this book. Most of the ones that really touched me may be found on my profile page, though the whole book is brimming with it.As this deals with the South during the Civil War, there is much talk of slavery; one of the reasons, I believe, it has been so frequently placed on the Banned Books list. Some people believe that it shows slavery in a favorable light, that blacks were/are children that need to be tended by whites. My opinion is this: it shows how many white Southern plantation owners viewed slaves. Not all slave owners were Mr. Simon Legree of Uncle Tom's Cabin. Conversely, not all slave owners are like the O'Hara's. Yes, there are a lot of black stereotypes (Mammy, Prissy, etc.), but this is a snapshot into the past. You can't take this book and try to force modern views of civil rights and racism into it. However, I do believe it makes a brilliant discussion piece: comparing Scarlett and other Southern whites' views of blacks with other accounts (such as Uncle Tom's Cabin or the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn).All in all, this is a brilliant book, made more excellent by the narrator, who deftly interprets the Southern dialect and accents for the listener. I thoroughly enjoyed it and was heart-broken, but inspired, when it ended. I highly recommend, even to those, like me, who aren't big into historical fiction.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*",
            "If you think this is chick lit, think again. Its thousand pages are so insightful a portrait, almost an expos&eacute;, of Cavalier society that I wonder at the book's popularity in the old Confederacy. It also sustains the lovely device of delivering the author's commentary through a pair of reverse-image channels, Ashley Wilkes and Rhett Butler, twins in their perceptions of the South but opposites in appearance and manner. The amazingly shallow Scarlett O'Hara carries on without quite noticing Ashley's and Rhett's joint narrative, flattering the reader's ability to see what she doesn't.Mitchell's portrayal of the races is as offensive as reality, which is saying a lot. Since we would rather that things had not been so and as we try to make them better it's useful having a baseline document like this, even though it can't properly imagine black slavery from the inside.About the last third of this long book changes tone as the author seems unable to maintain the same novelistic approach to Reconstruction as she did to the war. Mitchell's outrage boils over and the prose becomes somewhat expository.One cannot help being impressed by the continuation of that outrage for so many decades past the 1860s and 1870s. It prompts curiosity to learn more. Remember that Abraham Lincoln broke with the Republican Party late in his first term over post-war policy toward the South. As the GOP became the party of the Army (which it remains) it adopted a hard line that Lincoln rejected. Instead, Lincoln chose a southern (but anti-secessionist) Democrat as his running mate in 1864 under a \"National Union Party\" banner.What would it have meant, to blacks and whites, if Lincoln had been able to impose his own post-war policy? (And has any American ever faced decisions as awesome and consequential as did Abraham Lincoln?)Yet for all the book's historical and social interest in the end you can't around its marvelous sequence of set-pieces. Consider: Scarlett the pampered 19-year-old driving a dying mule and buckboard through the night and the following day amid the terrors of war with the lives of Melanie and her new-born constantly in the balance, only to emerge into her childhood world made desolate, her neighbors burnt out of their homes, her mother dead and her father helpless, her sisters ghostly from disease, broken soldiers roaming the land, and nothing to eat anywhere. How many of us can even grasp the idea of famine in an isolated rural area? Goodness gracious!Gone with the Wind leaves many images that will endure.",
            "If you loved the movie, you'll love the book. But be warned, the actual book itself (the hardcover published by Scribner) is shoddily made. The binding is falling apart and the pages are coming loose as I read it. I'm hoping it holds together until I'm finished reading it.",
            "This is a classic-- wonderful on so many levels and if you haven't read it then you owe yourself this treat. As a teen I was engrossed and ended up reading it several times over the years. ** small spoiler** As a younger person I always knew that Rhett came back to Scarlett. Later, when I got older, I was less certain that there was a happy ending for the pair and haven't read it since. But I still give it 5 stars because it is brilliant and beautiful and moving.",
            "I have read Gone with the Wind at least 10 times. Every time it is read, I find something missed previously. And every time I read it, it means something different to me. It has motivated me to read other books about that era of time and so I have learned a lot about the Civil War era and how important and significant it was for our country's history. I don't feel that the main thrust of the book was romance, but as in most lives, romance occurs some time, and the people of this novel also find some romance. Scarlett moves from one phase of life to the next with a realists mind except when it comes to Ashley Wilkes.All in all, it is a long book, but one that you won't forget.",
            "This book is a classic. One that I believe all southern women should read and pass down to their daughters. It is a story of love, loss, and an age in which we could never fully understand. That being said, this version's printing is not the best. On nearly every page, there are words or letters that are not fully printed. The hardcover, binding, and dust cover are in wonderful shape. The packaging and delivery, too, were outstanding. The only drawback I see is the printing not being 100% clear on each page. I think if you are interesting in purchasing a hardcover copy, you may wish to try a different version. I hope this is helpful.",
            "Well, I'm 41 years old and have finally read this classic! I'm so glad I read it! It will definitely go down as one of my favorites ever read. Margaret Mitchell is a genious writer who really made me feel like I was right there in the south with all of the wonderful characters!This book is filled with romance, war, politics, friendship, business dealings, deception and so so much more! Lots of characters that entertwine and so much fun to read!I couldn't put it down! It is a big book, but well worth it!Read it! Read it!",
            "Ageless story giving a digestable history of the the American Civil War, a feeling of what it was like to live at that time and an entrancing love story. Loved this edition too, good paper and easy size to hold for a long book.",
            "I read this book as a tween and loved it. I didn't know enough to be offended by Mitchell's whitewash of slavery. I hated Melanie and Ashley, and I loved Scarlett and Rhett, even though I thought Scarlett was some kind of a moron to have the hots for Ashley. When I became a novelist, I realized that my love/hate experience with the characters demonstrated just how crafty Mitchell had been in creating her characters because by then I'd met a bunch of readers who loved Melanie/Ashley and hated Scarlett/Rhett. Something for everyone? You betcha. And her \"I'll think about that tomorrow\" ending was also a brilliant move, equally satisfying to readers who want Scarlett to get Rhett back and those who don't.",
            "I have read GWTW many times and have always longed for an adequate recording of this book. So, when I saw this book on CD at the library I checked it out. What a disappointment!I was so sure that a company with the stature of Recorded Books would select only the best narrator. This should have been given to Flo Gibson--someone with the vocal and acting chops to really do justice to both the narative and character portrayal.Just because someone can act well, it doesn't necessarily follow that she will be a great reader. This actor does, in all justice a fairly good job with Scarlett. However, her pacing and phrasing during the narrative portions was mediocre at best and GWTW has a lot of narrative. Secondary characters are not treated with much differentiation of vocal dynamics, expression or seemingly thought about character. The phrasing was particularly poor and down right irritating at times. It sounded as if this reader gave no preparation to some passages and sat down with the book to read aloud passages that she was seeing for the first time. I am really suprised that the editiors let this pass into publication.The only reason I gave it two stars is because the reader does an adequate job with Scarlett and seems to get the accent dead on. \"Reading\" this performance was so tedious that I did not finish the book. I certainly would not buy this performance. Read the book instead.",

For instance, the burning of Atlanta, does not and will never have the feeling and movement, and the right reaction on any other medium. Anyone who has seen this cannot disagree, I hope!Otherwise, I believe all has already been said on this, and I would not think Miss Mitchell would appreciate a review as long as her work which is set apart from all other literature. It IS in a class by itself! Thank you very much, WilesWales",
            "This has been my favorite book since I was a child. The book is so much better than the movie. I encourage anyone who has only seen the movie to make sure they read the book.The story starts out with a young Scarlett. She is a spoiled young woman who has never had to work for a thing in her life. She is different than many girls her age, because she thinks for herself. The setting is one where women were still property and a womans role in life was to be a wife and mother. Women didn't need any more ambition than that.Throughout the story, we watch as war changes Scarlett's life forever. Never does one scene happen in a battle, but you can feel the impact of the war in the various characters during the story. The author, Margaret Mitchell, gives us insight into the personal history of other characters in the book. This helps us to understand their motivations.The Scarlett in the book shows her human side more than the one in the movie. In the book it becomes obvious that Scarlett was doing the best she could to survive a terriable situation the world thrust upon her. In the movie, she seems like just a selfish b****. More than one scene in the book brings tears to my eye when I visualize what Scarlett was going through.",
            "My favorite book of all times. The description of the civil war helped me get a feel for what happened during those terrible times.",
            "It's remarkable to feel humbled by art, and that's what happened when I opened Gone With the Wind. I am humbled to be a reader of something so beautiful and full of intricacies that remind me what makes great literature, and moreover why it is so crucial.",
            "As good now as when I read it years ago. Everyone should read this at lest once in their life time.",
            "When I look back on my sophomore year of high school, I will remember it as the year I read Gone With the Wind, and became hooked. I have thought about it everyday since I started it. I adore this story. The descriptions in this book will take your breath away. Once when she was back at Tara, in the dead of winter, I looked up and was shocked that the sun was shining, and there was food downstairs in the refrigerator. It will literally sweep you in. I read it in September, in a little less than a week. I didn't read it as a challenge or anything. It was actually a &quot;rebelling&quot; act. My mom hates the story line because she doesn't like how Southerners &quot;won't let the war die.&quot; Her saying how much she hated it totally backfired because it only made me want to read it more so I could see what was so bad about it. Then I fell in love with it. When I re-read some of the dialogue, especially that at the end of the book, between Scarlett and Rhett, my heart positively aches. The language is so beautiful. I cried for an hour after I finished it. The ending is absolutely tragic, but there's no other way it could've ended and been as good. I don't understand how anyone can not like it. The Southern backdrop during the Civil War was a necessity to the essence of the story. I know slavery was one of America's greatest atrocities, but that's not what this book is about. It is the story of a woman trying to save herself and her home, and in the process, ruining the love of one of the most dashing, white knights of all fiction because of her only-human downfalls-greed, fear and lust.I loved Scarlett's character. She was exactly as Rhett described-a brave, frightened, insensitive, bull-headed child. She did try to be good, and then something would happen to scare her, so she'd get mean again. I loved Melanie, too. I want to be a friend like she was. She was good, but not goody-goody. She loved people fiercely, as Scarlett wanted things fiercely. She stood by her beloved friend to the bitter end, even though she knew Scarlett had betrayed her. Rhett was such an absolutely wonderful person. He only couldn't show it to the everyday Scarlett-hardened and greedy-because she would think him weak. He was only tender and loving when she was in fear. I want to meet someone like him-I just hope I don't act like Scarlett! The characters were so human, I loved them all. Everyone should read this book. It is such a beautifully-written masterpiece. It's my favorite.",
            "The movie is one the top classic cinimatographies that remains a hit to this day. The book however is far better. I was so spellbound by this novel that it put the movie to shame (although I am still in love with the movie).The words of Margaret Mitchell combined with the voice naration of Linda Stephens sets an imaginative scene unlike any other. I will admit there were a couple areas in this audio book that somewhat dragged a little and there were other parts where Linda Stephens' voice dramatized a little too far.Margaret Mithchell wrote a breathtaking novel of true passion combined with the overwhelming heartache and the meaning of love in it's finest. And Linda Stephens brings out the roll of each charactor, each with a pitch of their own.Chapter by chapter leads out the fall of selfishness, the depth of passion and the power one has in the will to correct. Gone With the Wind portrays how one [Scarlett O'Hara], like so many can blind themselves in seeking to gain wealth of money and false imagination - where as it can fool (time and time again) to throw away the richest love one could ever gain.",
            "\".....Was Tara still standing? Or was Tara also gone with the wind which had swept through Georgia?.....\" pg 365\".... Thoughts circled and swooped above her, dived down and drove tearing claws and sharp beaks into her mind, For a timeless time, she lay still, her face in the dirt, the sun beating hotly upon her...\" pg 356This is a literary masterpiece that really needs no introduction; and the only reason I comment tonight is for benefit of younger people who may not have read it as yet, and are making comparisons with the more recent \"Scarlett\" and, even more recently, \"Rhett Butler's People\". Neither of the sequel books, written by others, are representatives of the talent embodied by Margaret Mitchell herself.This story is one of the best ever told, and will go down through the ages as such. An unmatched tale of the Old South, where worlds are turned upside down and those exposed to sudden loss of wealth and life stations find unsuspected strengths within themselves as they rebuild their fortunes with nothing more than their tenacity and wits or find themselves \"winnowed out\" (as Rhett Butler so eloquently remarked) in the struggle. Unrequited love, passion, jealousy, mingle seamlessly with the historical passages written with digital accuracy regarding the Civil War and the resulting Reconstruction, misery for both black and white - is woven into the fabric of the story with attention to detail that, once read, lives within you forever. It's cast of characters live, breathe, and project their differences from the brilliance of Mitchell's pen into our own minds; truly unforgettable. THAT is the true measure of literary genius.If you are in search of the story, read this one and forget the other two, as there is no equal to the original GWTW, nor is there ever likely to be.",
            "GONE WITH THE WIND was a phenomenon when it first appeared as a novel during the 30's and its place in popular culture became even more entrenched when the wildly successful movie was released a few years later. The book is still worth reading today as Mitchell very skillfully brings to life the years just before during and after the Civil War from the viewpoint of white Georgians. When Mitchell started writing this book the Civil War had only been over less than seventy years (very comparable to a contemporary author writing about the events surrounding World War II) and the country was very deeply divided between North and South. Mitchell's Southern sympathies and prejudices are often very apparent and the modern reader needs to realize the author was a product of her time and not be so easily offended that they can not enjoy what the book has to offer. Mitchell created many memorable characters in her novel and though it has been called a \"soap opera\" the situations and characterizations are not unrealistic and the historical research is sound.",
            "It is a long book and oft discussed with over six hundred reviews, thus this is not an attempt to give a general, overall review. But there is a point I'd like to discuss:I was amused at several of the comments written by other reviewers regarding the point of view in Gone With the Wind. It is easy to only watch the movie and quickly read the book and leave with the wrong impression of what Mitchell wanted to portray about Southern culture and Southern values.But if the reader takes his or her time and carefully reads the passages, a very different picture of the antebellum south comes about. Pay particular attention to the dialogues between Scarlett and her mammy, and Scarlett and Rhett, and even Ashley. Scarlett routinely complains at having to act like a simpleton in order to win men's attention, and having to conceal her often much brighter \"smartness\" (I hesitate to use the word intelligence here, because, Scarlett, for all her skills and quick smartness, probably doesn't qualify as an intelligent person) in fear of scaring away potential suitors.The antebellum upper class woman, as portrayed by Mitchell, was a dainty flower, but one whose life was heavily circumscribed by the social expectations of the men. Mitchell points out the juxtaposition between plantation mistresses being expected to appear to the public as dainty china objects, yet behind the scenes be expected to manage large plantations, oversee dozens or hundreds of slaves, and deal with the everyday facts of nature (such as childbirth and sickness). Ellen O'Hara is portrayed as the archetypical plantation mistress who successfully pulls off this image: while her husband spends his day hunting and riding horses and drinking whisky, Ellen had a dawn to midnight existence as a tireless manager of a plantation, and \"her hands were never seen still.\"To some people it seems that Mitchell idolized certain aspects of antebellum southern culture-the theatre of manners that the southern upper class created for themselves, but the author was well aware and effectively portrayed to the reader how limiting it was to women. In fact, it was only with the destruction of the plantation world and the class of chivalry that Scarlett, her main character, was effectively liberalized. It is very much a feminist novel in the sense that it is the woman who succeeds (at least materialistically) when most men around her failed.The issue of slavery is a relatively minor one in the book, and not one that Mitchell discussed to great lengths. However, one must keep in mind that the book portrays the views of the upper class aristocracy class, and it is interesting to note that despite the supposed benevolence of the O'Haras and their neighbors, of the 100+ slaves at Tara before the war, only four remained to stay with their old masters. Mitchell did not get into great details on the brutality of slavery before the war or of white-black relationships, but she didn't completely ignore it either. During a scene when Scarlett visits several neighbors (all women) on a nearby plantation after Sherman and his army had passed through, one of the women mentioned how all the black women had gone off riding behind the Yankee soldiers, and that they'll get nothing but yellow babies out of it. The other ladies, shocked at the bringing up of a delicate topic, hushed her, but old Grandma Fontaine retorted back with, \"We've all seen yellow babies before and we know what it means.\"There is, of course, Rhett Butler's consistent disparaging of Southern culture and southern values.Mitchell did not idealize the antebellum south, far from it.",
            "Gone With the Wind is novel of epic proportions, and it does read like a soap opera. Then again, so does every book this long (try War and Peace sometime). This book examines a spoiled, ante-bellum socialite who has never had to lift a finger and the way she deals with utter poverty, death, and tragedy all around her. The book does have its flaws, which I will touch on in a moment, but it should be read simply for Scarlett's struggle. Yes, she is rude, mean, and a generally selfish and scheming woman, but she also a paragon of strength who simply refuses to bow to anyone. Throughout the book, people say that Sherman himself should beware of Scarlett, and they're right.Getting away from Scarlett--difficult in this novel--there are several other main characters. Rhett-the only man she cannot lure with her charms, Ashley-the only man she cannot get with her charms, and Melanie-Ashley's saintly wife--the antithesis of Scarlett, whom Scarlett hates but feels compelled to help.Much of this book is somewhat depressing, reading about hunger, toiling in the fields, working on the sick, but it does make you appreciate what you have.Now, for the flaws. First, the big one: Racism. Yes, this book is racist, but, for heaven's sake, it was written in 1936 by a woman from Atlanta who had been raised with her antebellum grandmothers. It's set in the Civil War, and it does accurately portray the feelings of whites at the time. Some of the black sentiments (&quot;Gee, Miss Scarlett, I wouldn't know what to do without you telling me&quot;) are a little incredulous, but there were some plantation owners who were nice to their slaves. Of course, the ones who get publicity were the evil ones. While evil slave owners did exist, this book is not about them, and it should be taken at face value. No, it isn't politically correct, but it wasn't meant to be. If you only want politically correct books, then you really can't even read the Bible.Other flaws: the subjecation of women to men (think of the time era again), the length (some descriptive parts can be skipped), and the many plots (watch the movie as you go to keep it all together).Other than these few things mentioned, this book is a marvelous example of Southern literature, but don't take it as a historical novel of the Civil War because it wasn't meant to be that. It's the story of one woman's refusal to surrender to whatever comes her way. It just happens to take place during the Civil War. It could have happened during the American Revolution; it just didn't. Also, it leaves you with a serious debate with yourself: Scarlett--justified or evil? Yes, she gets her riches and life back while everyone else mopes, but they eventually get their lives back as well--they just didn't demean themselves. Rare is the book that makes you question your own thoughts on the main character.",
            "ARGUABLY one of the greatest romance novels ever written, Margaret Mitchell's Gone With The Wind is also a quintessential war anecdote.I found nothing more powerful than to read of an American war set in 1864 and hear the television espousing our current warfare in the background - some things don't change.The vivacious, yet practical-minded, Scarlett O'Hara is a clean slate for Mitchell to mar with the outset of war, providing a powerful metaphor for generations to come.Unfortunately, many young people are not introduced to such classic literature and the distinct and poignant parallels between the American Civil War and the current Gulf War II may be left undiscovered.Considering her novel was written in 1936, it is easy to confuse her ability to evoke such universal emotions for modernity.Mitchell's delicate portrayal of the South set against the harsh backdrop of war can still be affiliated to by readers in the 21st Century.Reasoning war, censoring protestors or 'speculators', and anticipated outcomes are adeptly constructed by Mitchell that you wonder how predictable human nature must be.\"All wars are sacred... To those who have to fight them. If the people who started wars didn't make them sacred, who would be foolish enough to fight?\"It's such honesty, in a time of ettiquette and refinery, that makes the abhorrent Rhett Butler such a formidable character.Coercing the seductress to dispense of typically Southern notions, Rhett epitomises the way a war will corrupt and educate a sentimental nation.Mitchell presents her flawed characters with affection. You may find Scarlett simple and Rhett a rogue, but you come to love what they add to this charged scene.Gone With The Wind should hardly be dismissed because of its romantic formula and age. This book is timeless and has much to teach younger readers.",
            "I read this book two years ago during the summer I was fourteen. It was definitely one of the best books I ever read, and I don't think I would be me today without the influence of Gone With the Wind. Margaret Mitchell is a witch with a pen; her thrilling story of Scarlett, Rhett, Melanie, Ashley, and Tara is as compelling as it is frightening. You love every character and hate them at the same time while next to them you feel their pain, their longing, their heartache, their confusion, their human wickedness, and their love.Two warnings: I made the mistake of reading the ending of the book before I got to it. I didn't understand the ending but thought I did, so it ruined not only the completion but also my enjoyment of a matchless masterpiece. Do not, under any circumstances, read the ending. Secondly, if you have not seen the movie, don't watch it. If you have, don't be fooled. I read the book long before I saw the movie and felt like a part of GWTW. The movie is supposed to be one of the best ever made, but I was disappointed with it. The characters seemed compromised somehow, and the glory of my imagination was warped.GWTW is a daunting book, but I have not met a person on earth who does not call it a mountain above most. Read the book and love it!",
            "Thirty-two summers ago, I read my Great Aunt Cora's old copy of GWTW. The size was not daunting, even at twelve years old. I lived in Margaret Mitchell's Old South for weeks, shunning the sun as all Southern ladies should. Excitingly, I told my mother that Scarlett just kissed Rhett on the road to Rough and Ready, so they were bound to live happily ever after. I remember her secretive smile like it was yesterday. I still have that old book, and have probably read it more often than Aunt Cora. No other book has ever captivated me to the point that modern customs and places are foreign, while I am at Tara, Twelve Oaks, Aunt PittyPats', and even Belle's! The best of all times for me.",
            "It was a tale beautifully told.I just finished reading it,and I can't get out of it's spell.The tragic end is absolutely perfect. I'm a person who likes everything to be pleasant,and I expected the end to be a happy one - like Scarlett saying &quot;I love you!&quot; to Rhett and Rhett hugging her and saying he loved her too.I'm not dissappointed,just heart-broken.I didn't cry like one customer says she did,but still the odd feeling in my stomach won't go away yet.As I said,I just put down the book and it's great,even though it left a sinking feeling in my stomach. I can't figure how I can really be happy for an hour or so with this emotion left from the book. Let me tell you - this book is so powerful.I loved it.I feel sadness and pity for Scarlett.It's good that nothing like this really happened and it's just fiction.If you're sad,think like this - it's just a tale,not true,(even though it seems terribly real) and it just added things to your outlook on life and to your literature knowledge. You don't want to lose a moment of your life mourning over a tale that didn't even exist,and Scarlett wouldn't want you to. :)) So just smile,and let that smile be a grateful one to Margaret Michell.She really changed you,didn't she?",
            "Absolutely fantasic. This book was so good, even though I couldn`t stand Scarlett most of the time. All the different characters were ejoyable to read, and Rhett`s character had so many different layers that I was always trying to figure out just how much he cared for the unworthy Scarlett. READ THIS BOOK.",
            "Only on page 328, but I am already obsessed! I have received little support in reading this novel. In fact, when I tell people I am reading GWTW each person has replied, \"Oh wow. I've never read it but I saw the movie. Such a great love story.\"To be honest I find myself annoyed! I could never imagine a movie that could substitute this book. And, yes, a love story, but just as well a historical narrative of the grueling life during the civil war through the mind of Scarlet. This leaves me to wonder how could a movie encompass the pages and pages of her thoughts? I am almost too afraid to see the movie for fear it will not live up to my expectations.Anywho... Amazing novel thus far. I highly recommend to those age 12+. In fact, my 16 year old, second cousin recommended it! I'm so proud of her!Best,Kim",
            "I wasn't quite sure whether I would enjoy Gone With the Wind. It's a large, forbidding book. But I loved it. Most of you are probably familiar with the basic story: the main character is Scarlett O'Hara, a spoiled southern belle in the time of the Civil War, and her desire to get everything she wants, through any means possible. A huge book, there are many characters in Gone With the Wind. Scarlett manipulates many men, but the ones she really cares about (Ashley, and later, Rhett), she can't. When she gets something she wants, she doesn't want it anymore. Scarlett is always frustrated, and is always making plans for the future. In some ways, this wasn't what interested me most about the book. I loved the setting. I just read A Soldier's Secret (admittedly, in a whole different class of literature), but anyway, that was from the Union perspective of things. In Gone With the Wind, none of the Southern ladies think that there's going to be a war. And when war does break out, they think that they're going to \"lick\" the Yankees in one battle. But the \"Yankees\" thought the same thing: that the Confederacy would be beaten immediately. Instead, we have a long, drawn-out, brutal, four year conflict.The Southern culture described in the book was interesting too. Among rich Georgia plantation-owners, there is a code of conduct, a certain way of behaving. The ladies can't say what they really think, a widow must wear black mourning clothes for years and never have any fun (Scarlett is in this predicament when she's only seventeen), etc. etc. Rhett Butler challenges all these things. He openly admits that he'd work for the North if he got paid more, he doesn't believe that the South will win, and he mocks the patriotic \"brave\" men of Georgia who fight. But at other times, he can be really cruel to Ashley. It was interesting to see how different life was among wealthy people back then.As for the characters, Scarlett is spoiled and used to getting her way, and she's from a slave-owning family, and yet...sometimes you sympathize with her. She genuinely cares about Ashley, she does have feelings, even though she's not very intelligent (though good at flirting with men.) Most of the deeper ideas expressed by some of the other characters go right over her head, and I was really frustrated by that. But my favorite character was probably Rhett. He's not afraid to challenge the system and say what he thinks, and he always seems to pop in the most convenient situations (for him, at least.) Rhett, when he meets Scarlett, makes her begin to challenge the way of life a bit. When he meets her, she's in mourning for a husband she was married to for two months and who she didn't care about. Only seventeen, she is desperate to be able to go to parties again, and he helps her do that. But he's complicated too. Underneath that mask, he's not as smooth. I think the white characters in the book were very well portrayed. Melanie, the wife of Ashley, is also a very sweet and kind woman, though she always misconstrues what Scarlett is thinking. Melanie always believes the best of people (which perhaps is not always wise), but that makes her a lovable character.However, you have to remember that the book was written in the 1920s and 30s, and set in the 1860s. There are plenty of stereotypes about blacks, and some derogatory words for blacks (darkies, the n-word). I find it very hard to believe that some of the slaves turned servants never wanted freedom, independence, or money. You just have to be aware that Mitchell is obviously very biased, and not believe everything she tells you.Gone With the Wind is a timeless classic and I would definitely recommend it to everyone. You can read Becky's excellent review of it here. Gone With the Wind does take some commitment as it is almost 1000 pages long, but it's a rewarding read.You can read all of my reviews at my blog, novareviews.blogspot.com.",
            "Perhaps you've heard of Gone With the Wind. In movie form, this work is quite stunning and fun. In print, it's breathtaking and provides bone-jarring visuals as well as a rich and well-developed story not often encountered.Mitchell's portrait of pre-during-and post Civil War South gives depth and intelligence to the people of the land, while simultaneously giving voice to their faults and well-intentioned geniality of that day and age.Characters like Scarlett, Rhett and Melanie gain personality that the movie does no justice. Although you know Melanie is going to die, when it finally hits, there's a true sadness that this rich personality we've traveled with is now leaving us. And in the end, Rhett still does leave Scarlett, but it's about more than not \"giving a damn\" and we feel sorry more for Rhett in this scene than for Scarlett (although we are glad that she finally gets it!)The characters almost disappoint as well, as they do everything we wish they wouldn't and do not behave as we want our characters to, thwarting their happy ending every step of the way. But Scarlett's real and honest love for Tara surrounds the novel and holds every element of the story together.In the end, there's only sadness upon finishing this novel in that there will never be a sequel by the late Margaret Mitchell, and perhaps even if there were there'd be no duplicating the magic that she created in this true and poignant work.",
            "I bought an original book 1936. I am just a little more then half way through the book. I'm so glad I didn't live back then. I wouldn't have been near the woman Miss Scarlet was. But when I was growing up I didn't appreciate history. That's why I wanted to read Gone With the Wind. Great history lesson. Sad but that was then",
            "Simply this. GWTW is one of the best books I have ever read. Never thought that would be the case, as I assumed it was just a book about romance and that's not mt preferred genre. But here is the unfortunate truth: while I was completely captivated with the book, I loathe the way it ends. It is like the author just got tired of writing it and decided to wrap things up quick with a few bittersweet insights. So, 99.9% of the book is five stars, the rest, being the very end, gets zero stars.",
            "Gone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell is a timeless classic. It is a wonderful tale that keeps you truly enchanted by the life of Scarlett O'Hara. Gone With the Wind takes place before, during, and after the Civil War in Georgia. It starts out at the beloved Tara, but soon finds itself in Atlanta. When Scarlett speaks of everything going on you can't help but feel the emotion she feels.At the beginning of the story, Scarlett wants Ashley as her husband. However, Ashley is to be married to Melanie, his musical and intelligently inclined cousin. Scarlett ends up marrying Melanie's brother, Charles, even though she still loves Ashley. He soon dies in the war and leaves her with a baby boy. After the war, Scarlett marries her sister's fianc&eacute;e to keep the Yankees from getting Tara. He later dies in a Ku Klux Klan raid and leaves Scarlett with a baby girl. A year later, Scarlett marries Rhett Butler and has a baby girl with him. Soon Rhett leaves Scarlett forever because she still loves Ashley and she needs to sort out her life.",
            "I love the movie so much that I just had to read the book. Now after reading the book I feel like the movie does not follow the book as well or as much as I thought it should. I think the book was a beautiful very complex story and I appreciate the language that is used. The time that the quthor used to explain the thoughts of the characters truly showed her love for each one.I enjoyed the highs and the lows of each character and there was no one that I loved or hated through out the book (except ashley) :). In a time where Twilight and Harry Potter are all that people want to talk about I once again appreciated the journey I took reading this book.#TeamRhett",
            "GWTW remains the classical view southerner's have always thought life was before the \"War of Northern Aggression\", as so many call the Civil War. While life in the \"big house\" was opulent for some, it was bought and paid for by the inhumane life of countless slaves. As a southerner who family never owned slaves - we were too poor!, I enjoy the fantasy that is GWTW, but always have a sickening feeling in the pit of my stomach knowing that the life Scarlett lived was nothing like the life of the average farmer's daughter. Just as the \"robber barons\" of the north enjoyed oppulent living from New York to Newport, society can not afford all for some and nothing for the many. By the way, the book is still VERY LONG!",
            "What can you say about a classic except for simply wonderful. The storyline, the characters, the descriptions of the old south. The civil war and it's horrors, the price you pay for decisions you make. Above all an amazing love story. A classic that will play forever.",
            "I'm a literary snob, I'll admit it. I've read all the classics, and I even know some Literary Theory. Gone With the Wind? Pul-lease, racist, sexist, revanchist trash, made popular by all the young woman dreaming of being Scarlett and having both their Rhett and Ashley. Cheerleader fare. Escapist. WRONG!Gone with the Wind is an American War &amp; Peace. This is serious literature, which won the Pulitzer prize, no less. Most people don't see past the epic plot (which isn't as cut and dried as you may think) or the love story, but this is no less than a successfull attempt to reclaim a discarded culture. It is not about crinoline and lace, it it about the Apocalypse and how losers of the counter-revolution must learn to live in a place where all their politics, personal or civil, are demolished. Scarlett O'Hara is popular because she is an American, driven, materialistic, sentimental and utterly ruthless. Rhett Bulter is the tragic character of this book; the way of life and ideals he disdained are killing him, and he suffers like no one else in this post-apocalyptic landscape. His departure at the end is an act of contrition as much as a romantic failure; he had tried to recreate the materialism of the ante-bellum world, but negeclected the spirituality (such as it is) of men like Ashley Wilkes. Both men, the dreamer and the realist end up alone in a very sterile place. This book is proto-feminist as well. Scarlett survives, even as everything around her dies, but in the end, she too is alone.Don't dumb this masterpiece down. The movie fails to capture even a tenth of the depth here. And that awful sequel! Caused by the mistake that this book is some kind of romance novel. This is Art, and you can't stick a new ending on it, any more than you can a great painting or musical composition.",
            "I've read GWTW many times -once you get going you can't stop! I once gave a copy to a friend to read -she said it was 'too old fashioned' oh well her loss. I'm glad I'm in the company of true 'Windies' so I thought I'd share with you some interesting facts about the book: -Scarlett was originally named Pansy-Scarlett was partly based on Mitchell herself and her grandmother-Rhett was based on Mitchell's first husband Red Upshaw-the initials JRM in her dedication refer to her second husband John Reginald Marsh-Margaret Mitchell maintained the only character taken from real life was Prissy the maid-When asked who she'd like to be in the movie version, Mitchell said 'Prissy'-Like a detective novelist, Mitchell wrote the last chapter first and the first chapter last-GWTW is the only book to sell more copies than the bible-Mitchell nearly went blind just proofreading the manuscript!-Mitchell scrupously researched every detail for GWTW, even going to the town register to ensure there was no Rhett Butler or Scarlett O'Hara alive during the Civil War-The novel took ten years to complete, most of it was written in three-For style, she endeavoured to make her prose so that a five-year old could read it-If she were ever to write a sequel, it would be called 'Back With the Breeze' On that note,please avoid the Ripley penned sequel 'Scarlett', it is atrocious.-Gone with the Wind is my favourite book of all time, and yours too, I hope. Enjoy!",
            "I would give this 10 stars if I could. I haven't read this since I was a young girl in the early 70's and should never have waited so long to read it again. The characters were exceptionally well drawn, the dialogue was brilliant, particularly between Rhett (SIGH!) and Scarlett. I swear there was sparks flying off the pages. I am going to miss the people I will have to put behind me now that the book has come to an end, Rhett (SIGH), Scarlett, Mammy, Prissy and Aunt Pitty Pat (LOL).The author's use of prose was beautiful, all the scenes and action came alive for me. Some people seem to be offended by the racism in the book, but that's how things were back then. Sugar coating it would have ruined the story reducing it to a Harlequin romance.This is an incredibly well written book about the death of a civilization and the struggles to survive in the new era. This is a book that should not be missed, particulary those who enjoy historical fiction.",
            "It took this reviewer half a century to get around to reading this great novel for the first time! Appreciating it then, with 'fresh eyes' I share the view that \"Gone With The Wind\" is quite simply the most readable long novel of all time. With world-wide sales nudging 25 million, it's probably fair to say that most first-time readers (apart from the odd reviewer here at the world's biggest web site) have shared that opinion in the almost 70 years since Margaret Mitchell wrote her one-and-only book. At least one other, highly readable novelist of the past century, the late James A. Michener certainly felt that way.I'm recalling an interview of thirty years ago in which Michener - a master storyteller in his own right - expressed awe at Mitchell's achievement. I remember Michener quoted a long-forgotten critic who greeted the book's release in 1936 with the perfect, one-sentence summing up: \"It's the shortest long novel I have ever read!\" Michener predicted at that time (1975) that \"critics will forever have to grapple with the problem of why Margaret Mitchell's novel has remained so readable, and so important to so many people.\"Michener singled out a few of the \"super-dramatic confrontations\" so perfectly conjured up in Mitchell's lucid, timeless writing style: Mammy lacing Scarlett into her corset; the wounded at the railway station; Scarlett shooting the Union straggler; the girls making Scarlett a dress from the moss-green velvet draperies; Rhett carrying his wife upstairs to the long-unused bedroom.Yet for all of its amazing drama, the novel does not ultimately depend upon major confrontations for its page-turning momentum: Michener I remember, zeroed in on two 'central' paragraphs which provide the reader with perfect glimpses into the way the two major characters have 'grown' before our eyes within these pages. One of these paragraphs captivates our imagination in about the middle of the book (chapter 29):\"Somewhere, on the long road that wound through those four years, the girl with her sachet and dancing slippers, had slipped away, and there was left a woman with sharp green eyes, who counted pennies and turned her hands to many menial tasks, a woman to whom nothing was left from the wreckage, except the indestructible red earth on which she stood.\"And, in the final pages, that indelible portrait of Rhett, age forty-five:\"He was sunken in his chair, his suit wrinkling untidily against his thickening waist, every line of him proclaiming the ruin of a fine body and the coarsening of a strong face. Drink and dissipation had done their work on the coin-clean profile, and now it was no longer the head of a young pagan prince on newly minted gold, but a decadent, tired Caesar on copper debased by long usage.\"It's true to say (again as Michener noted thirty years ago) that the weakness of \"Gone With The Wind\" is the almost exclusive focus on Atlanta, ignoring the rest of the South: When in fact, it was really the ENTIRE South that changed, \"altered by war, and defeat, and social upheaval - and stark determination to re-establish itself.\" Michener astutely observed that GWTW \"depicts with remarkable felicity, the spiritual history of a region.\"Most everyone these days would concede that Margaret Mitchell's personal views on the \"liberation of the former slaves\" (as expressed in subsequent interviews) were less than compassionate. Nevertheless, it was NOT Mitchell who composed those words which make some of us wince when they're scrolling up the screen in the movie version - words quaintly poetic perhaps, but manifestly insulting to those Americans whose ancestors never mistook the days of slavery as part of some \"pretty world\" poignantly longed-for, or in some way better than America today. (This reviewer has a pretty good memory for well-cadenced English prose, and this is his memory of those opening words from some anonymous male screenwriter.)\"There was a land of cavaliers and cotton fields called the 'Old South.' Here, in this pretty world, gallantry took its last bow. Here was the last ever to be seen of knights and their ladies fair, of master and slave. Look for it only in books, for it is no more than a dream remembered, a civilization gone with the wind.\"So much better are the novelist's own words, distilled into so many sentences and paragraphs that positively 'sing' in our memory. Like this one:\"He swung her off her feet into his arms and started up the stairs. Her head was crushed against his chest and she heard the hard hammering of his heart beneath her ears. He hurt her and she cried out, muffled, frightened. Up the stairs, he went in the utter darkness, up, up, and she was wild with fear.\"Or this:\"Hunger gnawed at her empty stomach again, and she said aloud: \"As God is my witness, as God is my witness, the Yankees aren't going to lick me. I'm going to live through this, and when it's over, I'm never going to be hungry again. No, nor any of my folks. If I have to steal or kill - as God is my witness, I'm never going to be hungry again.\"-----I have often thought that \"age twenty-six\" is the single most important year of any long and healthy lifetime (for too many subjective reasons to list here; but think of the athletes or musicians we've admired when they were at the very summit of their game -- in their twenty-sixth year). So it comes as no surprise to learn that Margaret Mitchell was at that same magic age when she began work on this --- the book another great novelist of the last century would term \"this long and powerful recollection of her home town - destined to become a titanic tale of human passions, loved around the world\" . . . (its astonishing impact) \"a mystery then, and remains one now.\"",
            "Growing up in Georgia, I've had a first hand look at the American South. After reading Gone with the Wind, I realized the South hasn't changed that much. We don't have slavery anymore but the lifestyle and traditions remain much the same. THAT is what makes Mitchell's work so enlightening. She relates the Southern Culture better than any other writer barring Pat Conroy. She shows the strength, the loyalty, the compassion, and the gumption of a good southern woman. She also relates the frustration and rebellion at being expected to take a backseat service-oriented role in society and especially in the family. But it doesn't stop there. Mitchell also weaves one heck of a story scattered with some of the most unique and memorable characters in fiction. Characters such as Scarlett O'Hara's love interest Ashley, her bestfriend/worst enemy Melanie (Ashley's wife), and of course the sly Rhett Butler. The book is timeless, the story compelling.A romantic at heart, I appreciate the subtleties of the struggle for love unattained and love unreturned, both of which give this story a personal touch. If you are curious to see why this novel is the 2nd best selling book in the world next to the Bible, pick it up and expect a long, complex story with unforgettable characters, a glimpse of a fleeting culture, and prose that tastes like an expensive red wine.",
            "Margaret Mitchell wrote, for her first book (an earlier work, called &quot;Lost Laysen&quot; has since been published), an exhaustingly researched, wide-ranging, exciting and thrilling book set in the Civil War. This book - Gone With The Wind - was a runaway success; and ultimately made into the biggest movie of its day. Alright, let's admit it, by modern standards it's sexist, racist, overblown, and melodramatic. And it's pretty darned brilliant. I have read this book no less than ten times! In theory, one ought to detest that spoiled little brazen, Scarlett O'Hara, but Margaret Mitchell makes her into a vivid, strong human being, a woman with spirit and the will to survive, but who was essentially immature and spoilt. But she was fiercely protective, loyal, and someone who you were forced to admire, even as you disliked what she was doing. She also had a alarming propensity to fall in love with the wrong men - this was a woman doomed to claw her way anywhere to succeed, but at the same time, estranging herself in the eyes of her Society. But does she give up, does she make it a tragedy? No. She gets up and keeps going, she just doesn't let people see that she minds it very much. She is an inspiration, but she doesn't really deserve to be. Scarlett is flawed, hideously so, but none the less, we are forced to admire her. She IS the book. A weaker or less flawed heroine would be irritating or just TOO unsympathetic. Her unrequitted love is very believable, it's happened to most of us at one time in our youth, and we never really quite shake that first infatuation off without a rude or painful awakening.The attitudes which feature in this book, although sexist and racist to us now, were perfectly normal for Civil War Southerners - Margaret Mitchell really understood the way people behaved at this time, and did not make them behave out of period or in anachronistic ways. Like Georgette Heyer and Regency England, she has a true understanding and insight into the period she is writing about - she LIVES it, and her people could have been alive then without unduly standing out as unusual or unremarkable.Scarlett is a rebel, but she does not go as far as a modern author might make her heroine go. She loves her family and her land, though she may deny it, and she is very proud. She is an inspirational woman, a true forerunner of the power woman of the 1980s - a sensational concept, even for the 1930s! The clever thing is how, in such a huge and spreading book, everything comes together. It may seem trivial and unnecessary to discuss Aunt Pittypat's drawing room, or go into the minutae of Scarlett's wardrobe, or to discuss events that happened a long time ago, but believe me, it is all very important in building up a coherent and very accurate (scarily accurate, for 1930s historical fiction - Heyer and Mitchell, as far as I know, were the only authors at this time who really bothered to research in depth for their &quot;lightweight&quot; historical fiction writing.) Gone With The Wind is a masterpiece. It must not be read with modern eyes, but as an amazing study of how people behaved, lived, and survived throughout the Civil War in America on the losing side.",
            "I love this book and have read it many times however this particular edition is missing a page, page 713 has been replaced with page 813, and you don't want to miss a word of Gone With the Wind!",
            "Margaret Mitchell was born in 1900 in Atlanta, Georgia. Throughout her childhood she heard stories of life before, during, and after the Civil War. In the 1920s she suffered a broken ankle. In order to pass the time, and inspired by the stories of her childhood, Mitchell began to write a book. She did not consider herself a novelist and did not think about publication--until 1935, when she impulsively gave the ragged manuscript to a visiting publisher's representative. The rest, as they say, is history: GONE WITH THE WIND was a phenomena. The reading public loved it; even the critics hailed it; and a celebrated film version merely added fuel to the fire. It has been translated into a host of languages, it has never been out of print, and to this day it remains among the most widely-read novels ever written.In hindsight, it is obvious that Mitchell was somewhat overpraised as an artist. She is not a writer who can complete with the likes of Jane Austen or Mark Twain, and she has a distinct tendency to write \"on the surface\" rather than in depth. But she has two great strengths, and the first of these is narrative power. If nothing else, Mitchell was a born story teller with an instinctive grasp of what it took to make you turn the next page; at one thousand pages, GONE WITH THE WIND is a long book--but it never seems long when you are actually reading it. Mitchell's second great strength is ability to create archetypical characters that seem to embody everything you know as well as everything you feel you should have known, and Scarlett O'Hara joins the ranks of Austen's Elizabeth Bennett, Thackery's Becky Sharp, and Tolstoi's Anna Karenina as one of the most memorable female characters in the history of literature. As art, the novel does have faults, but it is vividly, sharply alive. You believe in the world and the events and people that Mitchell presents.Social critics presently accuse Mitchell and GONE WITH THE WIND of racism. I find it difficult to criticize a writer and a work from the past for failing to adopt the attitudes of the present; all writers bring their own day and age to the table, and Mitchell's attitudes and ideas about black people and slavery were in the American mainstream of her day. In this sense, the book is perhaps best considered as a marker of where we once were and how far we have come since its original publication. It is also worth noting that while GONE WITH THE WIND is set before, during, and after the Civil War, and while many of its characters are slaves or freed slaves, it is not a novel about the Civil War or about slavery. It is about a self-centered woman of that era who is clever without being intellectual, who is remarkably hypocritical, and who can in many ways be described as morally bankrupt. We see this world through her eyes, and since she is utterly uninterested in the causes of the war, and even less so in the myriad of moral and ethical issues that swirl around slavery, we learn very little about either in any real sense--and to further complicate matter Mitchell never implies that Scarlett, those who swirl around her, and their attitudes and actions are to admired or accepted; they simply are.This said, social critics do have a significant point when they note that the popularity of GONE WITH THE WIND had the effect of perpetuating the idea that slavery was \"not all that bad\" long after such ideas should have been no longer tolerated. I do indeed recommend the book--it is extremely memorable, so much so that it virtually created the genre of romantic historical fiction without every being bested by the host of novels that followed it--but I do not recommend that any one come to it without a fairly good idea of what the Old South was like in actual fact. It is all very well to see that world through the eyes of Scarlett O'Hara for a time, but we need the ability to pull away from her point of view, and to compare it to reality, once the novel is set aside.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",
            "\"Gone With the Wind,\" as a novel, has been mistakenly dismissed by literary critics as pulp fiction for the masses. This view is premature and biased, in my opinion. If one digs deeply into the fabric of this very complex novel, one is likely to find that this novel works on two very different levels: the external level, in which themes such as survival and romantic love figure prominently; and the internal level, in which themes such as division v. reunion and the child v. the adult figure prominently.An external analysis of the novel yields much that has been obvious to the reading and movie-going public for years. \"Gone With the Wind\" is, most obviously, a very powerful novel about a young woman's survival of two unique crises: the American Civil War and Reconstruction of the South that followed. The personal qualities of those who survive and prosper in this novel -- characters such as Scarlett O'Hara, Rhett Butler, Mammy, Will Benteen, old Mrs. Fontaine, even Mrs. Merriwether -- are contrasted sharply with those who do not survive and prosper: Ashley Wilkes, Ellen O'Hara, Gerald O'Hara, and Scarlett's first two husbands, Charles Hamilton and Frank Kennedy.Melanie Hamilton presents an interesting study in the story of survival. Margaret Mitchell uses her to represent the dignified stateliness of the Old South matron. Rather than becoming a victim of the Old South's disintegration, she survives in a way that equals or even surpasses Scarlett's survival. Melanie, whom Mitchell originally intended as the novel's heroine, is the woman who saves Tara from burning to the ground; the woman who drags her father's Mexican War sword to the landing at Tara, helping Scarlett defend it from the Yankee invader; and the woman who stands against polite society in order to defend Scarlett, her beloved sister-in-law, from the town's gossip. Yes, she dies at the end of the novel, and Mitchell uses this to represent the passing of the Old South. However, even here, Melanie dies in her own bed, in her own home, with her own family about her, and she dies on her own terms: after conceiving a child she knew placed her own life at risk.It is also about three interconnected love stories: the traditional, dignified courtship and marriage of Melanie Hamilton and Ashley Wilkes; the thwarted, unconsummated relationship between Ashley Wilkes and Scarlett O'Hara; and the temptuous, passionate courtship and marriage of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler. The central theme of these love stories is summarized early in the novel by Scarlett's father, Gerald O'Hara: \"Only when like marries like can there be any happiness.\"These themes, while universal and very powerful, are only external to the novel, and I don't believe the novel's power or universality are derived from the themes of survival and love. I believe its power is much more subtle. Indeed, for years, it has been a mystery to literary critics why this novel was received equally well by 10-year olds as well as 95-year olds. Therein lies its secret: it is a novel with which both the 10-year old child and the 95-year old adult can identify strongly. It is a novel about children and it is a novel about adults.Every one of the major characters has qualities of both children and adults in them. These are handled subtly, not obviously, and the language of the novel, which I believe Margaret Mitchell crafted deliberately along these lines, takes the reader in this direction. For example, listen to what Scarlett says about men: \"All the men in Scarlett's life, the Tarleton twins, the Calvert boys, Charles, and Frank, she could dismiss with the phrase, 'What a child!' Not Rhett. He was an adult in everything he did. Only Rhett and Ashley ...\"Scarlett is portrayed as both child and adult. \"I'm always your little girl,\" she says to her mother in the middle of the Civil War, when in fact she is a widow with a 2-year old son. The woman whose heroism saves Tara from oblivion is evaluated by Rhett at the end: \"My pet, you're such a child.\" By the end of the novel, when Scarlett is only 28 years old, she has been married three times, widowed twice, given birth to three children, and buried one of them. Yet, in her dreams, she is still \"a lost child.\" When asked if she thought Scarlett ever got Rhett back, Margaret Mitchell said: \"I don't think so, but I do think she finally grew up.\"Melanie is the adult who masquerades in child's clothing -- and has a child's figure. Mitchell takes pain to describe Melanie's physical appearance \"as that of a 10-year old boy, with narrow hips and height barely coming up to Ashley's shoulders.\" Yet it is Melanie who has the wisdom to see Scarlett's finer qualities, her strength of character, her commitment to her promises, and her ability to survive -- wisdom that is ironically viewed by Scarlett (and others) as foolishness. She is portrayed as foolish to be so loyal and loving to Scarlett; yet it turns out, in the end, that Scarlett's attachment to Ashley was imaginary, and it turns out in the end that Scarlett loves Melanie deeply. She is portrayed as foolish for defending Rhett Butler so staunchly, yet her wisdom about his good qualities is thoroughly vindicated by the novel's end. Of all the principles, it is Melanie who is the most wise -- and the most adult. Yet her external appearance is very childlike.Rhett is usually depicted as an adult, the black sheep of a prominent Charleston family who makes his own fortune as a blockade runner from just a $1,000 investment. He admits, at novel's end, that he wanted to care for Scarlett, as an adult would care for a child; yet he is relentlessly mothered by Melanie, especially toward the end: she straightens him up so that he can be presentable to Scarlett after her miscarriage; and only she can convince him to consent to Bonnie's funeral. Further, he enables Melanie's mothering throughout the novel. She is the only person that he truly respects because, I suspect, she is a reminder to him of his own mother, a character who is rather prominent in the novel, though largely absent. Interestingly, it is only Melanie who comes into contact with her, as she greets mourners for Bonnie in the parlor of Scarlett and Rhett's mansion.Ashley Wilkes is the real child of the four principles, but it takes Scarlett the entire duration of the novel, more than 12 years, to realize this. Ashley is the weakest character, the one who has failed to give up the \"life that [he] loved,\" the one who depicts the charm and grace of the Old South to Scarlett -- the only time that she succumbs to the mistake of looking back. Mitchell is very deft with this scene. It is portrayed as a scene that exposes Ashley and Scarlett's illicit love for each other. However, what's really being exposed here is their common dependence on the past, Ashley's being overt and Scarlett's much more deeply repressed. By implication, it's also exposing the true nature of their attraction for each other, because they shared a common upbringing, growing up on neighboring plantations.This scene is expertly crafted. While Ashley and Scarlett are reminiscing about the charm and grace of their common past -- an event which culminates in their hugging in a truly platonic manner, one in which they begin to understand each other -- they are exposed to the gossip and criticism of Atlanta society. What's being exposed here is not their unconsummated romance; it's their common reliance on living in the past. It's fitting that they should be exposed when they're reminiscing about their common past, because that is the real force of their attraction, the real reason for their love (an ultimately childish love, by the way). Mitchell uses this scene to expose them not to Atlanta society, but to the reader. They're not in love with each other; they're in love with a life that is (forgive the cliche) gone with the wind. At the end of the novel, when Scarlett realizes she truly loves Rhett, she sums up her relationship with Ashley: \"I've lost my lover and I've gained another child.\"Virtually every relationship in this novel can be evaluated as child v. adult; think, for example, of Mammy, the real mother figure of the novel. Look at Ellen and Gerald O'Hara; he was 43 when they married and she was 15; yet she mothers him, right up until her death. Consider one of their final episodes, recounted to Scarlett in Atlanta by John Wilkes, in which Gerald wanted to fight in the war. Ellen puts him to the test insofar as riding his horse is concerned, a test that \"little Gerald, who barely came up to her shoulders\" failed miserably. After Ellen dies, Gerald's life collapses and he is a broken man, right until his death.Finally, there is the theme of division and reunion that appears on numerous occasions throughout the novel. Consider how the novel starts: Scarlett is seated on the front steps of Tara between the Tarleton twins -- a divisive force for two brothers who are otherwise as \"alike as two bolls of cotton.\" The novel begins with internal and external symbols of division. The Civil War starts. We are introduced to Scarlett and Melanie, the two heroines who are complete opposites and, at least for Scarlett, adamantly opposed to one another. We are introduced to Ashley and Rhett, the two heroes who are also complete opposites, at least externally, and rather opposed to one another; Ashley dislikes Rhett's blackguardism, and Rhett has contempt for Ashley's weaknesses.Mitchell deliberately tries to convince the reader, by cleverly contrasting their external characteristics, that these characters are hopelessly divided. Scarlett \"hates\" Melanie because she is a foolish simpleton and Ashley's wife; Rhett is a symbol of the New South, and Ashley is a symbol of the Old South; Rhett is a survivor, Ashley is a victim. Scarlett is a divisive figure in Melanie and Ashley's marriage. Scarlett is a divisive figure in the Hamilton-Wilkes families: toward the end, she is the indirect cause of a family feud that splits the family into two separate camps. Scarlett, herself, is a divided character - the result of an alliance between an Irish immigrant and an established aristocrat from the Savannah coast. \"In her face were too sharply blended the sharp features of her father, an Irish immigrant, and the more delicate features of her mother, a French aristocrat from Savannah.\" Mitchell has even put division on Scarlett's face -- one reason that Vivien Leigh, who as an actress utilized divided eyebrows (one up, one down) for Scarlett, was such a perfect choice for the part. \"She is my Scarlett,\" admitted Margaret Mitchell.Division is the premise of the novel. Reunion is its conclusion. Everything that was divided is ultimately united by novel's end. Melanie and Scarlett reach an understanding with each other; Scarlett comes to realize how much she loves and relies on Melanie, and comes to appreciate her strength, the \"steel courage\" that has sustained her through many crises. Indeed, the evolution of their relationship is one of the most touching and endearing aspects of the novel. Whereas we begin the novel with Ashley depicted as the war hero whose life is lived for \"dignity and honor\" and with Rhett depicted as the blackguard who is motivated only by crass selfishness, we end the novel with Ashley reduced to a helpless, purposeless victim and Rhett enhanced as a loving husband and father. Along the way, the stark contrasts that Mitchell draws early between Rhett and Ashley yield to sympathetic comparisons. \"Did it ever occur to you, Scarlett, that Rhett and I are fundamentally alike?\" Ashley inquires toward the end. Yet their similarities are evident -- though repressed -- from the beginning. In a surprising confrontation with Mrs. Merriwether, Melanie defends Rhett's criticisms of the war because they mirror things her husband has written to her. Ashley and Rhett begin the novel as divided and opposed to one another; they end united and unified as characters. Melanie and Scarlett, likewise, begin the novel as opposed opposites and end the novel united and unified. Division begets reunion.This theme, division and reunion, is especially powerful when you consider the historical context of the novel. In my view, it is no accident, but rather a careful decision on Margaret Mitchell's part, to time the action of the novel from April 1861, the start of the Civil War, the ultimate symbol of division, to September 1873, the end of Reconstruction, the ultimate symbol of reunion. It is a breathtaking historical backdrop for a novel whose dramatic power is derived from characters experiencing division and reunion in their lives.It is curious that Mitchell's novel has born the brunt of belittling and contemptuous literary criticism over the years. When it debuted, it sold millions and won the Pulitzer Prize; no film, before or since, has ever been so widely anticipated as the 1939 film was. Its massive popularity, I suspect, and Mitchell's melodramatic writing style have contributed to this contempt. However, when one considers the thematic breadth of the novel, its impeccable structure, and the awesome scope of its narrative force, \"Gone With the Wind\" is a singular and astonishing achievement. I believe its universality, its appeal from the 10-year old to the 95-year old, is best explained by the themes of child v. adult and division v. reunion. I also believe that it is these themes that explain why it captivates us after 71 years and will continue to captive generations to come.",
            "I saw the movie before I read the book, and I thought it would be too much to read a book that was so long. But I was enthralled by the 2nd page, by the descriptions and the dialogue. The rest of the novel kept me enthralled because of the unconventionality of Scarlett and Rhett, and the messages about war, the finished past and the unavoidable future of the South in the mid-1800's. I loved the richness of the descriptions of the Old South, which made me feel so nostalgic even though I'm not even from the South! Also, I found the many characters to be well-developed and each major character had a distinct and sympathizable personality.My favorite parts are the ones with Scarlett and Rhett at each others' throats, before and during their \"courtship\" and even after they were married. Their dialogue is hilarious and clever, though admittedly the wit is all from Rhett and the amusement comes from seeing Scarlett brought down a few notches. Though it hurts to know that even though Scarlett FINALLY matures enough to dump Ashley and realize she needed to change, Rhett is no longer willing to give her another chance. It seems whenever Scarlett is actually sincere about something nobody believes her or is willing to give her the benefit of the doubt (except Melanie of course). What's great about the novel is that if one was one of the characters, he would just see Scarlett on the surface: selfish, conniving and coy, but with the narration, one can see where Scarlett is coming from, and actually sympathize with her actions. She was definitely a woman born in the wrong era. She would do just fine in the 21st Century.Scarlett is very much my favorite character, because even with her insensitivity, selfishness, and materialism, she is oftentimes the strongest person in the passel of main characters. She worked to the bone when she returned to Tara, knowing that her hands would have to be ruined in order to eat and live and provide for the family that looked to her for leadership. Sometimes it seemed she was the only practical, level-headed person in the whole book (excepting Rhett), especially since people like Suellen were just refusing to work because it was \"beneath\" them, refusing to admit things have changed and work had to be done. Scarlett knows what she wants and has the sense to go ahead and try to get it.Although, many times Scarlett's selfishness comes up so unexpectedly I burst out laughing at the outrageousness of her personality. For example there would be a long conversation or narrative about how the past was so beautiful and peaceful or about a nice thing a person has done, and the book has Scarlett completely overturn the comments with her contemptous thoughts on the contrary of what was just described. Her problem is that though she sees what's in front of her, she doesn't get the POINT of what she's seeing. Hence the character of Rhett. He is so much like her, but he is able to see what she misses. He points them out to her plainly, and in Rhett Scarlett meets her match. He has what she's missing. As a result, another piece of the novel comes together: through Rhett, Scarlett is able to mature and bridge, to an extent, the gap between the ideals of people living in the past and those living in the present. Unfortunately, this maturation is not without consequences.Because of Scarlett's headstrong personality, I found GWTW endlessy amusing, and I think it was meant to be - in showing the huge gap between the over-the-top, in-the-moment practicality of Scarlett and the immaterial dreams of yesterday held so tightly by Old Southerners like Ashley, Melanie, and the rest, Mitchell tells us that both ways of thinking have their benefits and faults. It's not good to hold on to the past without moving forward, but only worrying about current physical security without holding tight to family and identity will cause pain and loneliness in the future. The messages are many in GWTW, and none of the 1000+ pages are superfluous. It was a pleasure to read, to laugh at the witty dialogue, sigh with sadness or nostalgia, scoff with annoyance at characters' actions, and feel the pain of the bitter ironies that define the lives of characters like Scarlett and Rhett.GWTW is not just a love story to me; it's so much more than that. It makes you think about what's past, but warns you not to dwell on the memories. Also, issues about war, race, and gender are definitely touched upon, oftentimes subtly, and it makes for great analysis. I can see why this novel won the Pulitzer Prize. Many issues are laid out all at once in front of you, forcing you to acknowledge their presence, whether it's painful to do so or not. \"Gone With the Wind\" made it to my \"favorite books\" list by page 150. It's an amazing literary work; a real masterpiece.",
            "When I look back on my sophomore year of high school, I will remember it as the year I read Gone With the Wind, and became hooked. I have thought about it everyday since I started it. I adore this story. The descriptions in this book will take your breath away. Once when she was back at Tara, in the dead of winter, I looked up and was shocked that the sun was shining, and there was food downstairs in the refrigerator. It will literally sweep you in. I read it in September, in a little less than a week. I didn't read it as a challenge or anything. It was actually a &quot;rebelling&quot; act. My mom hates the story line because she doesn't like how Southerners &quot;won't let the war die.&quot; Her saying how much she hated it totally backfired because it only made me want to read it more so I could see what was so bad about it. Then I fell in love with it. When I re-read some of the dialogue, especially that at the end of the book, between Scarlett and Rhett, my heart positively aches. The language is so beautiful. I cried for an hour after I finished it. The ending is absolutely tragic, but there's no other way it could've ended and been as good. I don't understand how anyone can not like it. The Southern backdrop during the Civil War was a necessity to the essence of the story. I know slavery was one of America's greatest atrocities, but that's not what this book is about. It is the story of a woman trying to save herself and her home, and in the process, ruining the love of one of the most dashing, white knights of all fiction because of her only-human downfalls-greed, fear and lust.I loved Scarlett's character. She was exactly as Rhett described-a brave, frightened, insensitive, bull-headed child. She did try to be good, and then something would happen to scare her, so she'd get mean again. I loved Melanie, too. I want to be a friend like she was. She was good, but not goody-goody. She loved people fiercely, as Scarlett wanted things fiercely. She stood by her beloved friend to the bitter end, even though she knew Scarlett had betrayed her. Rhett was such an absolutely wonderful person. He only couldn't show it to the everyday Scarlett-hardened and greedy-because she would think him weak. He was only tender and loving when she was in fear. I want to meet someone like him-I just hope I don't act like Scarlett! The characters were so human, I loved them all. Everyone should read this book. It is such a beautifully-written masterpiece. It's my favorite.",
            "The movie is one the top classic cinimatographies that remains a hit to this day. The book however is far better. I was so spellbound by this novel that it put the movie to shame (although I am still in love with the movie).The words of Margaret Mitchell combined with the voice naration of Linda Stephens sets an imaginative scene unlike any other. I will admit there were a couple areas in this audio book that somewhat dragged a little and there were other parts where Linda Stephens' voice dramatized a little too far.Margaret Mithchell wrote a breathtaking novel of true passion combined with the overwhelming heartache and the meaning of love in it's finest. And Linda Stephens brings out the roll of each charactor, each with a pitch of their own.Chapter by chapter leads out the fall of selfishness, the depth of passion and the power one has in the will to correct. Gone With the Wind portrays how one [Scarlett O'Hara], like so many can blind themselves in seeking to gain wealth of money and false imagination - where as it can fool (time and time again) to throw away the richest love one could ever gain.",
            "\".....Was Tara still standing? Or was Tara also gone with the wind which had swept through Georgia?.....\" pg 365\".... Thoughts circled and swooped above her, dived down and drove tearing claws and sharp beaks into her mind, For a timeless time, she lay still, her face in the dirt, the sun beating hotly upon her...\" pg 356This is a literary masterpiece that really needs no introduction; and the only reason I comment tonight is for benefit of younger people who may not have read it as yet, and are making comparisons with the more recent \"Scarlett\" and, even more recently, \"Rhett Butler's People\". Neither of the sequel books, written by others, are representatives of the talent embodied by Margaret Mitchell herself.This story is one of the best ever told, and will go down through the ages as such. An unmatched tale of the Old South, where worlds are turned upside down and those exposed to sudden loss of wealth and life stations find unsuspected strengths within themselves as they rebuild their fortunes with nothing more than their tenacity and wits or find themselves \"winnowed out\" (as Rhett Butler so eloquently remarked) in the struggle. Unrequited love, passion, jealousy, mingle seamlessly with the historical passages written with digital accuracy regarding the Civil War and the resulting Reconstruction, misery for both black and white - is woven into the fabric of the story with attention to detail that, once read, lives within you forever. It's cast of characters live, breathe, and project their differences from the brilliance of Mitchell's pen into our own minds; truly unforgettable. THAT is the true measure of literary genius.If you are in search of the story, read this one and forget the other two, as there is no equal to the original GWTW, nor is there ever likely to be.",
            "GONE WITH THE WIND was a phenomenon when it first appeared as a novel during the 30's and its place in popular culture became even more entrenched when the wildly successful movie was released a few years later. The book is still worth reading today as Mitchell very skillfully brings to life the years just before during and after the Civil War from the viewpoint of white Georgians. When Mitchell started writing this book the Civil War had only been over less than seventy years (very comparable to a contemporary author writing about the events surrounding World War II) and the country was very deeply divided between North and South. Mitchell's Southern sympathies and prejudices are often very apparent and the modern reader needs to realize the author was a product of her time and not be so easily offended that they can not enjoy what the book has to offer. Mitchell created many memorable characters in her novel and though it has been called a \"soap opera\" the situations and characterizations are not unrealistic and the historical research is sound.",
            "It is a long book and oft discussed with over six hundred reviews, thus this is not an attempt to give a general, overall review. But there is a point I'd like to discuss:I was amused at several of the comments written by other reviewers regarding the point of view in Gone With the Wind. It is easy to only watch the movie and quickly read the book and leave with the wrong impression of what Mitchell wanted to portray about Southern culture and Southern values.But if the reader takes his or her time and carefully reads the passages, a very different picture of the antebellum south comes about. Pay particular attention to the dialogues between Scarlett and her mammy, and Scarlett and Rhett, and even Ashley. Scarlett routinely complains at having to act like a simpleton in order to win men's attention, and having to conceal her often much brighter \"smartness\" (I hesitate to use the word intelligence here, because, Scarlett, for all her skills and quick smartness, probably doesn't qualify as an intelligent person) in fear of scaring away potential suitors.The antebellum upper class woman, as portrayed by Mitchell, was a dainty flower, but one whose life was heavily circumscribed by the social expectations of the men. Mitchell points out the juxtaposition between plantation mistresses being expected to appear to the public as dainty china objects, yet behind the scenes be expected to manage large plantations, oversee dozens or hundreds of slaves, and deal with the everyday facts of nature (such as childbirth and sickness). Ellen O'Hara is portrayed as the archetypical plantation mistress who successfully pulls off this image: while her husband spends his day hunting and riding horses and drinking whisky, Ellen had a dawn to midnight existence as a tireless manager of a plantation, and \"her hands were never seen still.\"To some people it seems that Mitchell idolized certain aspects of antebellum southern culture-the theatre of manners that the southern upper class created for themselves, but the author was well aware and effectively portrayed to the reader how limiting it was to women. In fact, it was only with the destruction of the plantation world and the class of chivalry that Scarlett, her main character, was effectively liberalized. It is very much a feminist novel in the sense that it is the woman who succeeds (at least materialistically) when most men around her failed.The issue of slavery is a relatively minor one in the book, and not one that Mitchell discussed to great lengths. However, one must keep in mind that the book portrays the views of the upper class aristocracy class, and it is interesting to note that despite the supposed benevolence of the O'Haras and their neighbors, of the 100+ slaves at Tara before the war, only four remained to stay with their old masters. Mitchell did not get into great details on the brutality of slavery before the war or of white-black relationships, but she didn't completely ignore it either. During a scene when Scarlett visits several neighbors (all women) on a nearby plantation after Sherman and his army had passed through, one of the women mentioned how all the black women had gone off riding behind the Yankee soldiers, and that they'll get nothing but yellow babies out of it. The other ladies, shocked at the bringing up of a delicate topic, hushed her, but old Grandma Fontaine retorted back with, \"We've all seen yellow babies before and we know what it means.\"There is, of course, Rhett Butler's consistent disparaging of Southern culture and southern values.Mitchell did not idealize the antebellum south, far from it.",
            "Gone With the Wind is novel of epic proportions, and it does read like a soap opera. Then again, so does every book this long (try War and Peace sometime). This book examines a spoiled, ante-bellum socialite who has never had to lift a finger and the way she deals with utter poverty, death, and tragedy all around her. The book does have its flaws, which I will touch on in a moment, but it should be read simply for Scarlett's struggle. Yes, she is rude, mean, and a generally selfish and scheming woman, but she also a paragon of strength who simply refuses to bow to anyone. Throughout the book, people say that Sherman himself should beware of Scarlett, and they're right.Getting away from Scarlett--difficult in this novel--there are several other main characters. Rhett-the only man she cannot lure with her charms, Ashley-the only man she cannot get with her charms, and Melanie-Ashley's saintly wife--the antithesis of Scarlett, whom Scarlett hates but feels compelled to help.Much of this book is somewhat depressing, reading about hunger, toiling in the fields, working on the sick, but it does make you appreciate what you have.Now, for the flaws. First, the big one: Racism. Yes, this book is racist, but, for heaven's sake, it was written in 1936 by a woman from Atlanta who had been raised with her antebellum grandmothers. It's set in the Civil War, and it does accurately portray the feelings of whites at the time. Some of the black sentiments (&quot;Gee, Miss Scarlett, I wouldn't know what to do without you telling me&quot;) are a little incredulous, but there were some plantation owners who were nice to their slaves. Of course, the ones who get publicity were the evil ones. While evil slave owners did exist, this book is not about them, and it should be taken at face value. No, it isn't politically correct, but it wasn't meant to be. If you only want politically correct books, then you really can't even read the Bible.Other flaws: the subjecation of women to men (think of the time era again), the length (some descriptive parts can be skipped), and the many plots (watch the movie as you go to keep it all together).Other than these few things mentioned, this book is a marvelous example of Southern literature, but don't take it as a historical novel of the Civil War because it wasn't meant to be that. It's the story of one woman's refusal to surrender to whatever comes her way. It just happens to take place during the Civil War. It could have happened during the American Revolution; it just didn't. Also, it leaves you with a serious debate with yourself: Scarlett--justified or evil? Yes, she gets her riches and life back while everyone else mopes, but they eventually get their lives back as well--they just didn't demean themselves. Rare is the book that makes you question your own thoughts on the main character.",
            "ARGUABLY one of the greatest romance novels ever written, Margaret Mitchell's Gone With The Wind is also a quintessential war anecdote.I found nothing more powerful than to read of an American war set in 1864 and hear the television espousing our current warfare in the background - some things don't change.The vivacious, yet practical-minded, Scarlett O'Hara is a clean slate for Mitchell to mar with the outset of war, providing a powerful metaphor for generations to come.Unfortunately, many young people are not introduced to such classic literature and the distinct and poignant parallels between the American Civil War and the current Gulf War II may be left undiscovered.Considering her novel was written in 1936, it is easy to confuse her ability to evoke such universal emotions for modernity.Mitchell's delicate portrayal of the South set against the harsh backdrop of war can still be affiliated to by readers in the 21st Century.Reasoning war, censoring protestors or 'speculators', and anticipated outcomes are adeptly constructed by Mitchell that you wonder how predictable human nature must be.\"All wars are sacred... To those who have to fight them. If the people who started wars didn't make them sacred, who would be foolish enough to fight?\"It's such honesty, in a time of ettiquette and refinery, that makes the abhorrent Rhett Butler such a formidable character.Coercing the seductress to dispense of typically Southern notions, Rhett epitomises the way a war will corrupt and educate a sentimental nation.Mitchell presents her flawed characters with affection. You may find Scarlett simple and Rhett a rogue, but you come to love what they add to this charged scene.Gone With The Wind should hardly be dismissed because of its romantic formula and age. This book is timeless and has much to teach younger readers.",
            "I read this book two years ago during the summer I was fourteen. It was definitely one of the best books I ever read, and I don't think I would be me today without the influence of Gone With the Wind. Margaret Mitchell is a witch with a pen; her thrilling story of Scarlett, Rhett, Melanie, Ashley, and Tara is as compelling as it is frightening. You love every character and hate them at the same time while next to them you feel their pain, their longing, their heartache, their confusion, their human wickedness, and their love.Two warnings: I made the mistake of reading the ending of the book before I got to it. I didn't understand the ending but thought I did, so it ruined not only the completion but also my enjoyment of a matchless masterpiece. Do not, under any circumstances, read the ending. Secondly, if you have not seen the movie, don't watch it. If you have, don't be fooled. I read the book long before I saw the movie and felt like a part of GWTW. The movie is supposed to be one of the best ever made, but I was disappointed with it. The characters seemed compromised somehow, and the glory of my imagination was warped.GWTW is a daunting book, but I have not met a person on earth who does not call it a mountain above most. Read the book and love it!",
            "Thirty-two summers ago, I read my Great Aunt Cora's old copy of GWTW. The size was not daunting, even at twelve years old. I lived in Margaret Mitchell's Old South for weeks, shunning the sun as all Southern ladies should. Excitingly, I told my mother that Scarlett just kissed Rhett on the road to Rough and Ready, so they were bound to live happily ever after. I remember her secretive smile like it was yesterday. I still have that old book, and have probably read it more often than Aunt Cora. No other book has ever captivated me to the point that modern customs and places are foreign, while I am at Tara, Twelve Oaks, Aunt PittyPats', and even Belle's! The best of all times for me.",
            "It was a tale beautifully told.I just finished reading it,and I can't get out of it's spell.The tragic end is absolutely perfect. I'm a person who likes everything to be pleasant,and I expected the end to be a happy one - like Scarlett saying &quot;I love you!&quot; to Rhett and Rhett hugging her and saying he loved her too.I'm not dissappointed,just heart-broken.I didn't cry like one customer says she did,but still the odd feeling in my stomach won't go away yet.As I said,I just put down the book and it's great,even though it left a sinking feeling in my stomach. I can't figure how I can really be happy for an hour or so with this emotion left from the book. Let me tell you - this book is so powerful.I loved it.I feel sadness and pity for Scarlett.It's good that nothing like this really happened and it's just fiction.If you're sad,think like this - it's just a tale,not true,(even though it seems terribly real) and it just added things to your outlook on life and to your literature knowledge. You don't want to lose a moment of your life mourning over a tale that didn't even exist,and Scarlett wouldn't want you to. :)) So just smile,and let that smile be a grateful one to Margaret Michell.She really changed you,didn't she?",
            "I'm a literary snob, I'll admit it. I've read all the classics, and I even know some Literary Theory. Gone With the Wind? Pul-lease, racist, sexist, revanchist trash, made popular by all the young woman dreaming of being Scarlett and having both their Rhett and Ashley. Cheerleader fare. Escapist. WRONG!Gone with the Wind is an American War &amp; Peace. This is serious literature, which won the Pulitzer prize, no less. Most people don't see past the epic plot (which isn't as cut and dried as you may think) or the love story, but this is no less than a successfull attempt to reclaim a discarded culture. It is not about crinoline and lace, it it about the Apocalypse and how losers of the counter-revolution must learn to live in a place where all their politics, personal or civil, are demolished. Scarlett O'Hara is popular because she is an American, driven, materialistic, sentimental and utterly ruthless. Rhett Bulter is the tragic character of this book; the way of life and ideals he disdained are killing him, and he suffers like no one else in this post-apocalyptic landscape. His departure at the end is an act of contrition as much as a romantic failure; he had tried to recreate the materialism of the ante-bellum world, but negeclected the spirituality (such as it is) of men like Ashley Wilkes. Both men, the dreamer and the realist end up alone in a very sterile place. This book is proto-feminist as well. Scarlett survives, even as everything around her dies, but in the end, she too is alone.Don't dumb this masterpiece down. The movie fails to capture even a tenth of the depth here. And that awful sequel! Caused by the mistake that this book is some kind of romance novel. This is Art, and you can't stick a new ending on it, any more than you can a great painting or musical composition.",
            "I've read GWTW many times -once you get going you can't stop! I once gave a copy to a friend to read -she said it was 'too old fashioned' oh well her loss. I'm glad I'm in the company of true 'Windies' so I thought I'd share with you some interesting facts about the book: -Scarlett was originally named Pansy-Scarlett was partly based on Mitchell herself and her grandmother-Rhett was based on Mitchell's first husband Red Upshaw-the initials JRM in her dedication refer to her second husband John Reginald Marsh-Margaret Mitchell maintained the only character taken from real life was Prissy the maid-When asked who she'd like to be in the movie version, Mitchell said 'Prissy'-Like a detective novelist, Mitchell wrote the last chapter first and the first chapter last-GWTW is the only book to sell more copies than the bible-Mitchell nearly went blind just proofreading the manuscript!-Mitchell scrupously researched every detail for GWTW, even going to the town register to ensure there was no Rhett Butler or Scarlett O'Hara alive during the Civil War-The novel took ten years to complete, most of it was written in three-For style, she endeavoured to make her prose so that a five-year old could read it-If she were ever to write a sequel, it would be called 'Back With the Breeze' On that note,please avoid the Ripley penned sequel 'Scarlett', it is atrocious.-Gone with the Wind is my favourite book of all time, and yours too, I hope. Enjoy!",
            "I would give this 10 stars if I could. I haven't read this since I was a young girl in the early 70's and should never have waited so long to read it again. The characters were exceptionally well drawn, the dialogue was brilliant, particularly between Rhett (SIGH!) and Scarlett. I swear there was sparks flying off the pages. I am going to miss the people I will have to put behind me now that the book has come to an end, Rhett (SIGH), Scarlett, Mammy, Prissy and Aunt Pitty Pat (LOL).The author's use of prose was beautiful, all the scenes and action came alive for me. Some people seem to be offended by the racism in the book, but that's how things were back then. Sugar coating it would have ruined the story reducing it to a Harlequin romance.This is an incredibly well written book about the death of a civilization and the struggles to survive in the new era. This is a book that should not be missed, particulary those who enjoy historical fiction.",
            "It took this reviewer half a century to get around to reading this great novel for the first time! Appreciating it then, with 'fresh eyes' I share the view that \"Gone With The Wind\" is quite simply the most readable long novel of all time. With world-wide sales nudging 25 million, it's probably fair to say that most first-time readers (apart from the odd reviewer here at the world's biggest web site) have shared that opinion in the almost 70 years since Margaret Mitchell wrote her one-and-only book. At least one other, highly readable novelist of the past century, the late James A. Michener certainly felt that way.I'm recalling an interview of thirty years ago in which Michener - a master storyteller in his own right - expressed awe at Mitchell's achievement. I remember Michener quoted a long-forgotten critic who greeted the book's release in 1936 with the perfect, one-sentence summing up: \"It's the shortest long novel I have ever read!\" Michener predicted at that time (1975) that \"critics will forever have to grapple with the problem of why Margaret Mitchell's novel has remained so readable, and so important to so many people.\"Michener singled out a few of the \"super-dramatic confrontations\" so perfectly conjured up in Mitchell's lucid, timeless writing style: Mammy lacing Scarlett into her corset; the wounded at the railway station; Scarlett shooting the Union straggler; the girls making Scarlett a dress from the moss-green velvet draperies; Rhett carrying his wife upstairs to the long-unused bedroom.Yet for all of its amazing drama, the novel does not ultimately depend upon major confrontations for its page-turning momentum: Michener I remember, zeroed in on two 'central' paragraphs which provide the reader with perfect glimpses into the way the two major characters have 'grown' before our eyes within these pages. One of these paragraphs captivates our imagination in about the middle of the book (chapter 29):\"Somewhere, on the long road that wound through those four years, the girl with her sachet and dancing slippers, had slipped away, and there was left a woman with sharp green eyes, who counted pennies and turned her hands to many menial tasks, a woman to whom nothing was left from the wreckage, except the indestructible red earth on which she stood.\"And, in the final pages, that indelible portrait of Rhett, age forty-five:\"He was sunken in his chair, his suit wrinkling untidily against his thickening waist, every line of him proclaiming the ruin of a fine body and the coarsening of a strong face. Drink and dissipation had done their work on the coin-clean profile, and now it was no longer the head of a young pagan prince on newly minted gold, but a decadent, tired Caesar on copper debased by long usage.\"It's true to say (again as Michener noted thirty years ago) that the weakness of \"Gone With The Wind\" is the almost exclusive focus on Atlanta, ignoring the rest of the South: When in fact, it was really the ENTIRE South that changed, \"altered by war, and defeat, and social upheaval - and stark determination to re-establish itself.\" Michener astutely observed that GWTW \"depicts with remarkable felicity, the spiritual history of a region.\"Most everyone these days would concede that Margaret Mitchell's personal views on the \"liberation of the former slaves\" (as expressed in subsequent interviews) were less than compassionate. Nevertheless, it was NOT Mitchell who composed those words which make some of us wince when they're scrolling up the screen in the movie version - words quaintly poetic perhaps, but manifestly insulting to those Americans whose ancestors never mistook the days of slavery as part of some \"pretty world\" poignantly longed-for, or in some way better than America today. (This reviewer has a pretty good memory for well-cadenced English prose, and this is his memory of those opening words from some anonymous male screenwriter.)\"There was a land of cavaliers and cotton fields called the 'Old South.' Here, in this pretty world, gallantry took its last bow. Here was the last ever to be seen of knights and their ladies fair, of master and slave. Look for it only in books, for it is no more than a dream remembered, a civilization gone with the wind.\"So much better are the novelist's own words, distilled into so many sentences and paragraphs that positively 'sing' in our memory. Like this one:\"He swung her off her feet into his arms and started up the stairs. Her head was crushed against his chest and she heard the hard hammering of his heart beneath her ears. He hurt her and she cried out, muffled, frightened. Up the stairs, he went in the utter darkness, up, up, and she was wild with fear.\"Or this:\"Hunger gnawed at her empty stomach again, and she said aloud: \"As God is my witness, as God is my witness, the Yankees aren't going to lick me. I'm going to live through this, and when it's over, I'm never going to be hungry again. No, nor any of my folks. If I have to steal or kill - as God is my witness, I'm never going to be hungry again.\"-----I have often thought that \"age twenty-six\" is the single most important year of any long and healthy lifetime (for too many subjective reasons to list here; but think of the athletes or musicians we've admired when they were at the very summit of their game -- in their twenty-sixth year). So it comes as no surprise to learn that Margaret Mitchell was at that same magic age when she began work on this --- the book another great novelist of the last century would term \"this long and powerful recollection of her home town - destined to become a titanic tale of human passions, loved around the world\" . . . (its astonishing impact) \"a mystery then, and remains one now.\"",
            "Growing up in Georgia, I've had a first hand look at the American South. After reading Gone with the Wind, I realized the South hasn't changed that much. We don't have slavery anymore but the lifestyle and traditions remain much the same. THAT is what makes Mitchell's work so enlightening. She relates the Southern Culture better than any other writer barring Pat Conroy. She shows the strength, the loyalty, the compassion, and the gumption of a good southern woman. She also relates the frustration and rebellion at being expected to take a backseat service-oriented role in society and especially in the family. But it doesn't stop there. Mitchell also weaves one heck of a story scattered with some of the most unique and memorable characters in fiction. Characters such as Scarlett O'Hara's love interest Ashley, her bestfriend/worst enemy Melanie (Ashley's wife), and of course the sly Rhett Butler. The book is timeless, the story compelling.A romantic at heart, I appreciate the subtleties of the struggle for love unattained and love unreturned, both of which give this story a personal touch. If you are curious to see why this novel is the 2nd best selling book in the world next to the Bible, pick it up and expect a long, complex story with unforgettable characters, a glimpse of a fleeting culture, and prose that tastes like an expensive red wine.",
            "Margaret Mitchell wrote, for her first book (an earlier work, called &quot;Lost Laysen&quot; has since been published), an exhaustingly researched, wide-ranging, exciting and thrilling book set in the Civil War. This book - Gone With The Wind - was a runaway success; and ultimately made into the biggest movie of its day. Alright, let's admit it, by modern standards it's sexist, racist, overblown, and melodramatic. And it's pretty darned brilliant. I have read this book no less than ten times! In theory, one ought to detest that spoiled little brazen, Scarlett O'Hara, but Margaret Mitchell makes her into a vivid, strong human being, a woman with spirit and the will to survive, but who was essentially immature and spoilt. But she was fiercely protective, loyal, and someone who you were forced to admire, even as you disliked what she was doing. She also had a alarming propensity to fall in love with the wrong men - this was a woman doomed to claw her way anywhere to succeed, but at the same time, estranging herself in the eyes of her Society. But does she give up, does she make it a tragedy? No. She gets up and keeps going, she just doesn't let people see that she minds it very much. She is an inspiration, but she doesn't really deserve to be. Scarlett is flawed, hideously so, but none the less, we are forced to admire her. She IS the book. A weaker or less flawed heroine would be irritating or just TOO unsympathetic. Her unrequitted love is very believable, it's happened to most of us at one time in our youth, and we never really quite shake that first infatuation off without a rude or painful awakening.The attitudes which feature in this book, although sexist and racist to us now, were perfectly normal for Civil War Southerners - Margaret Mitchell really understood the way people behaved at this time, and did not make them behave out of period or in anachronistic ways. Like Georgette Heyer and Regency England, she has a true understanding and insight into the period she is writing about - she LIVES it, and her people could have been alive then without unduly standing out as unusual or unremarkable.Scarlett is a rebel, but she does not go as far as a modern author might make her heroine go. She loves her family and her land, though she may deny it, and she is very proud. She is an inspirational woman, a true forerunner of the power woman of the 1980s - a sensational concept, even for the 1930s! The clever thing is how, in such a huge and spreading book, everything comes together. It may seem trivial and unnecessary to discuss Aunt Pittypat's drawing room, or go into the minutae of Scarlett's wardrobe, or to discuss events that happened a long time ago, but believe me, it is all very important in building up a coherent and very accurate (scarily accurate, for 1930s historical fiction - Heyer and Mitchell, as far as I know, were the only authors at this time who really bothered to research in depth for their &quot;lightweight&quot; historical fiction writing.) Gone With The Wind is a masterpiece. It must not be read with modern eyes, but as an amazing study of how people behaved, lived, and survived throughout the Civil War in America on the losing side.",
            "I love this book and have read it many times however this particular edition is missing a page, page 713 has been replaced with page 813, and you don't want to miss a word of Gone With the Wind!",
            "Margaret Mitchell was born in 1900 in Atlanta, Georgia. Throughout her childhood she heard stories of life before, during, and after the Civil War. In the 1920s she suffered a broken ankle. In order to pass the time, and inspired by the stories of her childhood, Mitchell began to write a book. She did not consider herself a novelist and did not think about publication--until 1935, when she impulsively gave the ragged manuscript to a visiting publisher's representative. The rest, as they say, is history: GONE WITH THE WIND was a phenomena. The reading public loved it; even the critics hailed it; and a celebrated film version merely added fuel to the fire. It has been translated into a host of languages, it has never been out of print, and to this day it remains among the most widely-read novels ever written.In hindsight, it is obvious that Mitchell was somewhat overpraised as an artist. She is not a writer who can complete with the likes of Jane Austen or Mark Twain, and she has a distinct tendency to write \"on the surface\" rather than in depth. But she has two great strengths, and the first of these is narrative power. If nothing else, Mitchell was a born story teller with an instinctive grasp of what it took to make you turn the next page; at one thousand pages, GONE WITH THE WIND is a long book--but it never seems long when you are actually reading it. Mitchell's second great strength is ability to create archetypical characters that seem to embody everything you know as well as everything you feel you should have known, and Scarlett O'Hara joins the ranks of Austen's Elizabeth Bennett, Thackery's Becky Sharp, and Tolstoi's Anna Karenina as one of the most memorable female characters in the history of literature. As art, the novel does have faults, but it is vividly, sharply alive. You believe in the world and the events and people that Mitchell presents.Social critics presently accuse Mitchell and GONE WITH THE WIND of racism. I find it difficult to criticize a writer and a work from the past for failing to adopt the attitudes of the present; all writers bring their own day and age to the table, and Mitchell's attitudes and ideas about black people and slavery were in the American mainstream of her day. In this sense, the book is perhaps best considered as a marker of where we once were and how far we have come since its original publication. It is also worth noting that while GONE WITH THE WIND is set before, during, and after the Civil War, and while many of its characters are slaves or freed slaves, it is not a novel about the Civil War or about slavery. It is about a self-centered woman of that era who is clever without being intellectual, who is remarkably hypocritical, and who can in many ways be described as morally bankrupt. We see this world through her eyes, and since she is utterly uninterested in the causes of the war, and even less so in the myriad of moral and ethical issues that swirl around slavery, we learn very little about either in any real sense--and to further complicate matter Mitchell never implies that Scarlett, those who swirl around her, and their attitudes and actions are to admired or accepted; they simply are.This said, social critics do have a significant point when they note that the popularity of GONE WITH THE WIND had the effect of perpetuating the idea that slavery was \"not all that bad\" long after such ideas should have been no longer tolerated. I do indeed recommend the book--it is extremely memorable, so much so that it virtually created the genre of romantic historical fiction without every being bested by the host of novels that followed it--but I do not recommend that any one come to it without a fairly good idea of what the Old South was like in actual fact. It is all very well to see that world through the eyes of Scarlett O'Hara for a time, but we need the ability to pull away from her point of view, and to compare it to reality, once the novel is set aside.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",
            "\"Gone With the Wind,\" as a novel, has been mistakenly dismissed by literary critics as pulp fiction for the masses. This view is premature and biased, in my opinion. If one digs deeply into the fabric of this very complex novel, one is likely to find that this novel works on two very different levels: the external level, in which themes such as survival and romantic love figure prominently; and the internal level, in which themes such as division v. reunion and the child v. the adult figure prominently.An external analysis of the novel yields much that has been obvious to the reading and movie-going public for years. \"Gone With the Wind\" is, most obviously, a very powerful novel about a young woman's survival of two unique crises: the American Civil War and Reconstruction of the South that followed. The personal qualities of those who survive and prosper in this novel -- characters such as Scarlett O'Hara, Rhett Butler, Mammy, Will Benteen, old Mrs. Fontaine, even Mrs. Merriwether -- are contrasted sharply with those who do not survive and prosper: Ashley Wilkes, Ellen O'Hara, Gerald O'Hara, and Scarlett's first two husbands, Charles Hamilton and Frank Kennedy.Melanie Hamilton presents an interesting study in the story of survival. Margaret Mitchell uses her to represent the dignified stateliness of the Old South matron. Rather than becoming a victim of the Old South's disintegration, she survives in a way that equals or even surpasses Scarlett's survival. Melanie, whom Mitchell originally intended as the novel's heroine, is the woman who saves Tara from burning to the ground; the woman who drags her father's Mexican War sword to the landing at Tara, helping Scarlett defend it from the Yankee invader; and the woman who stands against polite society in order to defend Scarlett, her beloved sister-in-law, from the town's gossip. Yes, she dies at the end of the novel, and Mitchell uses this to represent the passing of the Old South. However, even here, Melanie dies in her own bed, in her own home, with her own family about her, and she dies on her own terms: after conceiving a child she knew placed her own life at risk.It is also about three interconnected love stories: the traditional, dignified courtship and marriage of Melanie Hamilton and Ashley Wilkes; the thwarted, unconsummated relationship between Ashley Wilkes and Scarlett O'Hara; and the temptuous, passionate courtship and marriage of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler. The central theme of these love stories is summarized early in the novel by Scarlett's father, Gerald O'Hara: \"Only when like marries like can there be any happiness.\"These themes, while universal and very powerful, are only external to the novel, and I don't believe the novel's power or universality are derived from the themes of survival and love. I believe its power is much more subtle. Indeed, for years, it has been a mystery to literary critics why this novel was received equally well by 10-year olds as well as 95-year olds. Therein lies its secret: it is a novel with which both the 10-year old child and the 95-year old adult can identify strongly. It is a novel about children and it is a novel about adults.Every one of the major characters has qualities of both children and adults in them. These are handled subtly, not obviously, and the language of the novel, which I believe Margaret Mitchell crafted deliberately along these lines, takes the reader in this direction. For example, listen to what Scarlett says about men: \"All the men in Scarlett's life, the Tarleton twins, the Calvert boys, Charles, and Frank, she could dismiss with the phrase, 'What a child!' Not Rhett. He was an adult in everything he did. Only Rhett and Ashley ...\"Scarlett is portrayed as both child and adult. \"I'm always your little girl,\" she says to her mother in the middle of the Civil War, when in fact she is a widow with a 2-year old son. The woman whose heroism saves Tara from oblivion is evaluated by Rhett at the end: \"My pet, you're such a child.\" By the end of the novel, when Scarlett is only 28 years old, she has been married three times, widowed twice, given birth to three children, and buried one of them. Yet, in her dreams, she is still \"a lost child.\" When asked if she thought Scarlett ever got Rhett back, Margaret Mitchell said: \"I don't think so, but I do think she finally grew up.\"Melanie is the adult who masquerades in child's clothing -- and has a child's figure. Mitchell takes pain to describe Melanie's physical appearance \"as that of a 10-year old boy, with narrow hips and height barely coming up to Ashley's shoulders.\" Yet it is Melanie who has the wisdom to see Scarlett's finer qualities, her strength of character, her commitment to her promises, and her ability to survive -- wisdom that is ironically viewed by Scarlett (and others) as foolishness. She is portrayed as foolish to be so loyal and loving to Scarlett; yet it turns out, in the end, that Scarlett's attachment to Ashley was imaginary, and it turns out in the end that Scarlett loves Melanie deeply. She is portrayed as foolish for defending Rhett Butler so staunchly, yet her wisdom about his good qualities is thoroughly vindicated by the novel's end. Of all the principles, it is Melanie who is the most wise -- and the most adult. Yet her external appearance is very childlike.Rhett is usually depicted as an adult, the black sheep of a prominent Charleston family who makes his own fortune as a blockade runner from just a $1,000 investment. He admits, at novel's end, that he wanted to care for Scarlett, as an adult would care for a child; yet he is relentlessly mothered by Melanie, especially toward the end: she straightens him up so that he can be presentable to Scarlett after her miscarriage; and only she can convince him to consent to Bonnie's funeral. Further, he enables Melanie's mothering throughout the novel. She is the only person that he truly respects because, I suspect, she is a reminder to him of his own mother, a character who is rather prominent in the novel, though largely absent. Interestingly, it is only Melanie who comes into contact with her, as she greets mourners for Bonnie in the parlor of Scarlett and Rhett's mansion.Ashley Wilkes is the real child of the four principles, but it takes Scarlett the entire duration of the novel, more than 12 years, to realize this. Ashley is the weakest character, the one who has failed to give up the \"life that [he] loved,\" the one who depicts the charm and grace of the Old South to Scarlett -- the only time that she succumbs to the mistake of looking back. Mitchell is very deft with this scene. It is portrayed as a scene that exposes Ashley and Scarlett's illicit love for each other. However, what's really being exposed here is their common dependence on the past, Ashley's being overt and Scarlett's much more deeply repressed. By implication, it's also exposing the true nature of their attraction for each other, because they shared a common upbringing, growing up on neighboring plantations.This scene is expertly crafted. While Ashley and Scarlett are reminiscing about the charm and grace of their common past -- an event which culminates in their hugging in a truly platonic manner, one in which they begin to understand each other -- they are exposed to the gossip and criticism of Atlanta society. What's being exposed here is not their unconsummated romance; it's their common reliance on living in the past. It's fitting that they should be exposed when they're reminiscing about their common past, because that is the real force of their attraction, the real reason for their love (an ultimately childish love, by the way). Mitchell uses this scene to expose them not to Atlanta society, but to the reader. They're not in love with each other; they're in love with a life that is (forgive the cliche) gone with the wind. At the end of the novel, when Scarlett realizes she truly loves Rhett, she sums up her relationship with Ashley: \"I've lost my lover and I've gained another child.\"Virtually every relationship in this novel can be evaluated as child v. adult; think, for example, of Mammy, the real mother figure of the novel. Look at Ellen and Gerald O'Hara; he was 43 when they married and she was 15; yet she mothers him, right up until her death. Consider one of their final episodes, recounted to Scarlett in Atlanta by John Wilkes, in which Gerald wanted to fight in the war. Ellen puts him to the test insofar as riding his horse is concerned, a test that \"little Gerald, who barely came up to her shoulders\" failed miserably. After Ellen dies, Gerald's life collapses and he is a broken man, right until his death.Finally, there is the theme of division and reunion that appears on numerous occasions throughout the novel. Consider how the novel starts: Scarlett is seated on the front steps of Tara between the Tarleton twins -- a divisive force for two brothers who are otherwise as \"alike as two bolls of cotton.\" The novel begins with internal and external symbols of division. The Civil War starts. We are introduced to Scarlett and Melanie, the two heroines who are complete opposites and, at least for Scarlett, adamantly opposed to one another. We are introduced to Ashley and Rhett, the two heroes who are also complete opposites, at least externally, and rather opposed to one another; Ashley dislikes Rhett's blackguardism, and Rhett has contempt for Ashley's weaknesses.Mitchell deliberately tries to convince the reader, by cleverly contrasting their external characteristics, that these characters are hopelessly divided. Scarlett \"hates\" Melanie because she is a foolish simpleton and Ashley's wife; Rhett is a symbol of the New South, and Ashley is a symbol of the Old South; Rhett is a survivor, Ashley is a victim. Scarlett is a divisive figure in Melanie and Ashley's marriage. Scarlett is a divisive figure in the Hamilton-Wilkes families: toward the end, she is the indirect cause of a family feud that splits the family into two separate camps. Scarlett, herself, is a divided character - the result of an alliance between an Irish immigrant and an established aristocrat from the Savannah coast. \"In her face were too sharply blended the sharp features of her father, an Irish immigrant, and the more delicate features of her mother, a French aristocrat from Savannah.\" Mitchell has even put division on Scarlett's face -- one reason that Vivien Leigh, who as an actress utilized divided eyebrows (one up, one down) for Scarlett, was such a perfect choice for the part. \"She is my Scarlett,\" admitted Margaret Mitchell.Division is the premise of the novel. Reunion is its conclusion. Everything that was divided is ultimately united by novel's end. Melanie and Scarlett reach an understanding with each other; Scarlett comes to realize how much she loves and relies on Melanie, and comes to appreciate her strength, the \"steel courage\" that has sustained her through many crises. Indeed, the evolution of their relationship is one of the most touching and endearing aspects of the novel. Whereas we begin the novel with Ashley depicted as the war hero whose life is lived for \"dignity and honor\" and with Rhett depicted as the blackguard who is motivated only by crass selfishness, we end the novel with Ashley reduced to a helpless, purposeless victim and Rhett enhanced as a loving husband and father. Along the way, the stark contrasts that Mitchell draws early between Rhett and Ashley yield to sympathetic comparisons. \"Did it ever occur to you, Scarlett, that Rhett and I are fundamentally alike?\" Ashley inquires toward the end. Yet their similarities are evident -- though repressed -- from the beginning. In a surprising confrontation with Mrs. Merriwether, Melanie defends Rhett's criticisms of the war because they mirror things her husband has written to her. Ashley and Rhett begin the novel as divided and opposed to one another; they end united and unified as characters. Melanie and Scarlett, likewise, begin the novel as opposed opposites and end the novel united and unified. Division begets reunion.This theme, division and reunion, is especially powerful when you consider the historical context of the novel. In my view, it is no accident, but rather a careful decision on Margaret Mitchell's part, to time the action of the novel from April 1861, the start of the Civil War, the ultimate symbol of division, to September 1873, the end of Reconstruction, the ultimate symbol of reunion. It is a breathtaking historical backdrop for a novel whose dramatic power is derived from characters experiencing division and reunion in their lives.It is curious that Mitchell's novel has born the brunt of belittling and contemptuous literary criticism over the years. When it debuted, it sold millions and won the Pulitzer Prize; no film, before or since, has ever been so widely anticipated as the 1939 film was. Its massive popularity, I suspect, and Mitchell's melodramatic writing style have contributed to this contempt. However, when one considers the thematic breadth of the novel, its impeccable structure, and the awesome scope of its narrative force, \"Gone With the Wind\" is a singular and astonishing achievement. I believe its universality, its appeal from the 10-year old to the 95-year old, is best explained by the themes of child v. adult and division v. reunion. I also believe that it is these themes that explain why it captivates us after 71 years and will continue to captive generations to come.",
            "I saw the movie before I read the book, and I thought it would be too much to read a book that was so long. But I was enthralled by the 2nd page, by the descriptions and the dialogue. The rest of the novel kept me enthralled because of the unconventionality of Scarlett and Rhett, and the messages about war, the finished past and the unavoidable future of the South in the mid-1800's. I loved the richness of the descriptions of the Old South, which made me feel so nostalgic even though I'm not even from the South! Also, I found the many characters to be well-developed and each major character had a distinct and sympathizable personality.My favorite parts are the ones with Scarlett and Rhett at each others' throats, before and during their \"courtship\" and even after they were married. Their dialogue is hilarious and clever, though admittedly the wit is all from Rhett and the amusement comes from seeing Scarlett brought down a few notches. Though it hurts to know that even though Scarlett FINALLY matures enough to dump Ashley and realize she needed to change, Rhett is no longer willing to give her another chance. It seems whenever Scarlett is actually sincere about something nobody believes her or is willing to give her the benefit of the doubt (except Melanie of course). What's great about the novel is that if one was one of the characters, he would just see Scarlett on the surface: selfish, conniving and coy, but with the narration, one can see where Scarlett is coming from, and actually sympathize with her actions. She was definitely a woman born in the wrong era. She would do just fine in the 21st Century.Scarlett is very much my favorite character, because even with her insensitivity, selfishness, and materialism, she is oftentimes the strongest person in the passel of main characters. She worked to the bone when she returned to Tara, knowing that her hands would have to be ruined in order to eat and live and provide for the family that looked to her for leadership. Sometimes it seemed she was the only practical, level-headed person in the whole book (excepting Rhett), especially since people like Suellen were just refusing to work because it was \"beneath\" them, refusing to admit things have changed and work had to be done. Scarlett knows what she wants and has the sense to go ahead and try to get it.Although, many times Scarlett's selfishness comes up so unexpectedly I burst out laughing at the outrageousness of her personality. For example there would be a long conversation or narrative about how the past was so beautiful and peaceful or about a nice thing a person has done, and the book has Scarlett completely overturn the comments with her contemptous thoughts on the contrary of what was just described. Her problem is that though she sees what's in front of her, she doesn't get the POINT of what she's seeing. Hence the character of Rhett. He is so much like her, but he is able to see what she misses. He points them out to her plainly, and in Rhett Scarlett meets her match. He has what she's missing. As a result, another piece of the novel comes together: through Rhett, Scarlett is able to mature and bridge, to an extent, the gap between the ideals of people living in the past and those living in the present. Unfortunately, this maturation is not without consequences.Because of Scarlett's headstrong personality, I found GWTW endlessy amusing, and I think it was meant to be - in showing the huge gap between the over-the-top, in-the-moment practicality of Scarlett and the immaterial dreams of yesterday held so tightly by Old Southerners like Ashley, Melanie, and the rest, Mitchell tells us that both ways of thinking have their benefits and faults. It's not good to hold on to the past without moving forward, but only worrying about current physical security without holding tight to family and identity will cause pain and loneliness in the future. The messages are many in GWTW, and none of the 1000+ pages are superfluous. It was a pleasure to read, to laugh at the witty dialogue, sigh with sadness or nostalgia, scoff with annoyance at characters' actions, and feel the pain of the bitter ironies that define the lives of characters like Scarlett and Rhett.GWTW is not just a love story to me; it's so much more than that. It makes you think about what's past, but warns you not to dwell on the memories. Also, issues about war, race, and gender are definitely touched upon, oftentimes subtly, and it makes for great analysis. I can see why this novel won the Pulitzer Prize. Many issues are laid out all at once in front of you, forcing you to acknowledge their presence, whether it's painful to do so or not. \"Gone With the Wind\" made it to my \"favorite books\" list by page 150. It's an amazing literary work; a real masterpiece.",
            "This book has created intriguing characters. But the main characters like Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett are admired and glorified to a fault. Scarlett O'Hara is tough, practical and no-nonsense. But in essence, she's a villain with these qualities. She steals her own sister's boyfriend, emotionally abuses her children, marries men for money and spite, and cheats on everyone and anyone. Seems there's nothing she would not do for money and for herself. Surely she has certain qualities that are needed in a war to survive, but it's not the war that made her selfish to the core. It simply brings out her selfishness on a larger scale.",
            "I love this book. Scarlett is cunning and manipulative and sometimes ridiculous. But for all her flaws, she is a survivor and incredibly strong. Her story is beautiful, perfectly balanced and perfectly written.I so wish that Margaret Mitchell would have written more. Apparently one perfect book was enough for her, but it wasn't enough for generations of her fans!",
            "I've been pressured to read this book since about 5th grade. Everybody in my family has read it. I thought, \"What's so great about this huge book about the war? Boring.\" I finally picked it up this year. Definitely not boring.16 year old Scarlett O'Hara was not necessarily the most beautiful girl in Georgia, but her emerald eyes, 17 inch waist, and stubborn yet flirtatious attitude attracts all the men except Ashley Wilkes. The one man she thinks she truly wants. She has almost the perfect life; living on a huge plantation named Tara, and she's finally old enough to wear gorgeous dresses to various parties. She has the perfect slave, Mammy, keeping her in check throughout the story. Ashley has a party at his plantation, Twelve Oaks, to inform the town he is getting married to his cousin Melanie. Scarlett first puts on her flirt into overdrive to try to win him back, but when that doesn't work, she goes crazy breaking dishes and screaming while she should be upstairs napping with the other ladies. A mysterious man with a bad reputation just happened to be watching the whole thing. Rhett Butler. He was not intimidated by her like other men, he just laughed in amusement. But, the marriage does not stop Scarlett from getting what she wants. The Civil War doesn't either, it just greatly impairs it. Scarlett has to figure out how to live off of nothing and still keep her charm with the few men that are even around, not at war. She has to watch everything she loves break down to pieces before her own eyes; her family, Tara, and her wealth.Scarlett is such a brave character. She is a stubborn and selfish American heroine. She always says, \"I'll think about it later. After all, tomorrow is another day.\" This is an inspirational and true statement everybody should remember. People didn't know exactly how wonderful of life they had before the war, before they lost everything. I think all people experience this feeling. The knowledge that nothing will go back to the way it was. Miss Melly acts like nothing happened and hopes for the best. Scarlett on the other hand kept fighting herself and did things even a man wouldn't do to get her life back together again. She started her own business, married men for their money to help her family, and rode in carriages without an escort! That was scandalous and unheard of in the 1800s. It's the stubborn Irish coming out in her. She always wanted the best for herself. Not necessarily the people around her. But then there's Rhett who keeps popping up throughout the book giving Scarlett expensive gifts from Europe. Scarlett despises him for his smirks and smart attitude, but does she find she loves his sarcasm and money? Does she love him or hate him? You don't know until the last chapters.America was not joking when they voted Gone with the Wind as it's favorite novel. A classic. It's definitely a page turner. (All 1030 pages) You get a feeling of the other side of the Civil War. In history books the North was always the good guys. The Confederates hated the Yankees and their ways. I mean, who would want to have to free such devoted and motherly slaves like Mammy?This novel almost makes you mad because it doesn't go the way it's supposed to be. They should go back to being rich and happy! You want to pop into the book and get things all straightened out so it can be a happily ever after ending.I loved Gone with the Wind for many reasons. First of all, it made me realize that people in the old days were just the same as they are now. The characters are so real and have real life thoughts. Scarlett thought, \"If I have to steal or kill - as God is my witness, I'm never going to be hungry again.\" The people are not saying the perfect things at the perfect time like most books. Also, I loved the side stories with Scarlett's sisters, Ashley's relationship, the war, Rhett, the babies, and Scarlett's determination. It truly is one of the best books out there.",
            "Why is this novel the second best selling book in the world? Because every character evokes deep emotion to the reader whether love or hate. The complexity of the personalities written by Mitchell is amazing in itself, but place on top of that a writing style that flows like poetry and you've got in your hands the most fun a person can have with paper. Vivid descriptions of the Southern landscape, the Old South traditions, the Southern gentility, and the graceful way of life pre-Civil War are second to none. I have lived in the South my whole life and much of the lifestyle Mitchell relates in GWTW are accurate and still exist in one form or fashion. The South is the only true culture left in America and this is a window into how it began and what it was like in its peak. Traditions die hard down here but they are dying fast, get romanced by life south of the Mason-Dixon before it gets washed away in a flood of \"progress\".",
            "If you've ever read any classic like Pride and Prejudice you will love this novel. My friend once mentioned this novel was fantastic so I got my hands on a copy. Boy was I surprised to see how long it was and how small the font was. But it was completely worth it in the end. Margeret Mitchell really gets the point through with her novel. All the characters, such as Scarlett, feel so real throughout the whole book and everything is so thoroughly explained that you feel like your actually there. I also enjoyed the history in the book because I'll soon be studying the Civil War at school and this novel really helped me understand it in an enjoyable way.There are also many timeless lessons that are valuable for anyone.So anyone who loves romance, don't mind how long the novel is because in the end it's worth it. I urge you to go out and buy a copy NOW. :>",
            "To put it simply, this is the best book ever written. you have not lived until you have conquered this masterpiece of prose. For some, the length is intimidating, but it goes fast, so dont use that excuse. This book is a romance novel, a war story, a documentary all roled into one. there is something here for everyone.While reading this book, I found myself wishing so badly to be more like Melanie. Unfortunately, I am more of a Scarlett myself. I suspect most readers, if they are to be honest, would also admit to this. Yes, she is cruel, materialistic, unyeilding and rather spoiled. No, she isnt one to be envied. But still, there is something about her that one cant help but relate to. perhaps its because we watch her grow from a careless young lady to a hardened, stubborn adult. We know her story. we know her hopes and her fears and what drives her so far, and we cant help but admit that if we were in her shoes, wouldnt we have a similar response? all the same, one feels very little sympathy for her in the end, as she loses everything that matters, and is left with nothing but her money.Rhett, as another reviewer said, is certainly the tragic figure in this story. He is ultimately driven to accept the lifestyle that was originally so repulsive to him and that he worked so hard to avoid. ah, but for some there is some pride to be found in not being recieved! He loves Scarlett so much, yet due to her blindness to her own emotions, and the general reservations between them, their marriage fails. He tries to pour all the love and emotions he would otherwise show Scarlett onto Bonnie blue, but when she dies, there is nothing left for him. Its ironic, hes a big man, a strong man, a man to be afraid of...yet one almost cant help but to pity him.Great book.Read.",
            "Published in 1936, can any serious reader expect Gone With the Wind to mesh with 21st-century sensibilities? Of course not. Therefore, it may be wiser to open this book, put sensibilities aside, and let it rip because Gone With the Wind is simply a classic. Margaret Mitchell's Confederate sympathies hold little in the way of ambivalence. The dream-like plantation lifestyle, it's total devastation, and the abject humiliation of it's adherents under Reconstruction are starkly protrayed. Amidst the tragedy of civil war, Mitchell places a bevy of unforgettable characters whose inner strengths and weaknesses receive vivid definition - the interplay of which is truly sublime.Gone With the Wind is ultimately a story of traumatic loss and dogged perserverence, overcoming disaster, peeling oneself off of the cold, hard floor. To be sure, there is wicked condescension, biased justifications, premises so one-sided they defy belief, but through it all Gone With the Wind stands with Tolstoy's War and Peace in it's ability to bring the social costs of war to the surface in a manner both eloquent and disturbing. This book should be read by all. 5+ stars.",
            "GONE WITH THE WIND effortlessly uses the English language in ways I never thought possible, to tell the sweeping timeless story of a strong woman who stuck it out. People who say they don't like her are missing the point. Books are supposed to entertain, not preach. Scarlett may be selfish and stubborn and materialistic, but she is not boring. She lights up the pages with her vivacity. Give me an interesting heroine over a moral example any day.For more great books about Reconstruction in the South (and a girl who is in some ways exactly like Scarlett, and in others her polar opposite) go to littlecolonel.com and read the out-of-print Little Colonel series for free. Offers a new perspective on Scarlett's time.",
            "This is my favorite book of all time. Everyone should find time to read it. I realize it is 1024 pages of very small print and also that there are sixty-three chapters; however it is amazing. I realize too that it is in some cases a bit racist and there are people who are offended by that; to them, I privately say, \"Grow up\". Gone With the Wind is not about slavery. It is not about white supremacy. It is not even really about the South. It is about how war destroys people. You could take it and apply it to any war. I am by no means a white supremist, but those feelings need to be pushed aside while one enjoys such a wonderful book. I do not agree with Scarlett, or Melanie, or Ashley, or Rhett completely, but I can't help but tear up as I watch their world disappear again and again. It is a million times better than a history book to understand the causes of bigotry in the South after the war. As for Scarlett, she is infuriating, bullheaded, selfish, and childish, but I cannot help loving her anyway. Perhaps my favorite lines, though, come from Ashley, lost soul though he is:\"It's a curse--this not wanting to look on naked realities. Until the war, life was never more real to me than a shadow show on a curtain. And I preferred it so. I do not like the outlines of things to be too sharp. I like them gently blurred, a little hazy...It isn't that I mind splitting logs here in the mud, but I do mind what it stands for. I do mind, very much, the loss of the beauty of the old life I loved. Scarlett, before the war, life was beautiful. There was a glamor to it, a perfection and a completeness and a symmetry to it like Grecian art. Maybe it wasn't so to everyone. I know that now. But to me, living at Twelve Oaks, there was a real beauty to living. I belonged in that life. I was a part of it. And now it is gone and I am out of place in this new life, and I am afraid. Now, I know that in the old days it was a shadow show I watched. I avoided everything which was not shadowy, people and situations which were too real, too vital. I resented their intrusion. I tried to avoid you too, Scarlett. You were too full of living and too real and I was cowardly enough to prefer shadows and dreams.\"Everytime Ashley says what he truly thinks, it makes me cry. I never cry about anything, but I cry over Gone With the Wind. It's not that I want to be a part of that world, the pre-Civil War South, because I don't...it's just that Margaret Mitchell's words are magic, creating characters so real that I can't help but long for them to have what they want.",
            "...into the ad hoc matriarch of a shattered plantation family. Scarlett O'Hara makes you wince at her infuriating shallowness earlier in the story. You can spot it in a conversation between herself and Ashley Wilkes, the man she wants to steal away from Melanie Hamilton. Ashley comments that Rhett Butler (who Scarlett has just seen for the first time) looks like one of the Borgias. Scarlett asks which family they are--she doesn't know them. Ashley patiently explains that they're Italians. \"Oh,\" says Scarlett dismissively. \"Foreigners.\" The type of prideful ignorance that my own working class demographic (\"crackers\" back in those days) expresses like this; \"I'm dumb as hell and proud of it.\" One thing the movie doesn't capture by a long shot with Vivien Leigh as Scarlett and Olivia DeHavilland as Melanie is that these girls are teenagers, antebellum \"valley girls\". So actually, what do you expect? Basically, Melanie beats Scarlett out for Ashley's affections becase she is nowhere near as immature. But Scarlett's father frequently comments on her \"willfulness\", possibly without realizing himself that it's a clue to a titanic courage in his firstborn. In the ensuing story, the Civil War grinds up people and land. Melanie, Scarlett's onetime despised rival, becomes dependent upon her. Ashley is destroyed in spirit as well--a rich dandy doesn't have the moxie to endure war when it lands in his backyard. The main reason Scarlett ends up getting involved with Rhett is that he's the only man with her level of guts. Scarlett reminds me of Pat Conroy's \"Great Santini\" character--at first you can't stand her, you thank God no one like her is close to you, but when the chips are down, she's a survivor. And people associated with her survive as well. One thing this book points out is that the ugliness of war is a force of human nature, and people who think themselves insulated from it, or \"above war's barbarism\" wind up finding out the hard way that they're dead wrong. Now if only our present-day sheltered middle class and \"thinking people\" could face that inescapable truth...",
            "I love Gone with the Wind. I love the experience of reading it than watching the movie. The book has a lot of characters that were not part of the movie. For example, Scarlett O'Hara had a son with her first husband, the brother of Melanie Wilkes.Another example, in the movie, during the escape of Atlanta, Scarlett, Rhett Butler, Melanie and her baby, and a slave escaped the burning city. The book includes a small boy slave (I forgot his name) who accompanied them to Escape from Atlanta and he has a role who was known to complain and nag Scarlett.I love the movie, but the book is very detailed with each character, especially their personality and family background.",
            "Preceding the Civil War, talk in Atlanta is rife with apprehension and speculation that warfare lies in the near future. Gone with the Wind revolves around the initially idyllic existence of a belle, Scarlett O'Hara, her unsteady marriage with the scandalous Rhett Butler, and her unforeseen reality during the heart of the Civil War. The sentimental page-turner demonstrates inspiring courage, outrageous fervor, and dramatic life alterations, in an emotional episode...brought to life!",
            "This books is one of my all time favorites that I read over and over again. Over the years I have bought many copies and love to give this book as a gift for birthdays. It also makes a great hostess gift! The descriptions in this book are so amazingly colorful and wonderful that you see the fabric, feel Scarlett's corset, taste the food. You run the whole gamut of emotions. Every time I read it, I laugh, I cry, I rage at Scarlett and fall in love with Rhett Butler. This book has always been an education and I always find something new to marvel at every time I read it. Buy this book, buy two and give one to a friend!",
            "I love this classic book. In the movie, the cast does a great job of making them realistic.However, several decades removed from the reading, I find something happening each time I hear the music, or see pictures of Rhett Butler. Romance, yes. But also an immense sadness. A sadness that suggests the main characters could change nothing even if they wanted to do so, that they were predetermined to fail. I hope we have more control over our lives than they.A second sadness emerges; the unending optimism of Scarlett. It begs the question: Could her life have been different if at any point she had accepted the inevitable? Tara really could not change the inevitable, but could she?I love this incredibly sad story, and appreciate the history it relives for us all.",
            "Absolutely my favorite novel. It's a long one, but everyone should read it...men and women. Not only is is accurate historically, but it is also educational and interesting. The novel is far richer than the movie, and although the motion picture is a spectacle....the book puts the movie to shame. Read the book, and watch the movie again afterwards. The differences are astounding....but that is what keeps the novel interesting to modern readers. It's isn't the exact story we have seen on film on TCM again and again. Again, everyone should read this book. It has literary value, historic value, and pleasure value.",
            "GWTW-I discovered it on the shelf of my highschool library & having never heard of it, I decided I would read it. I was completely unprepared for the ride! While we all want to be Melanie, the truth is-we're all a little Scarlett on the inside! I have since read the book many times (and of course own the DVD) and never tire of it. A definite book for gals-you get a glimpse into southern life at the time of the Civil War and experience a love story of enormous preportions. &#34;Fiddle Dee Dee&#34; is our catch phrase around the house! LOVED IT&#62;",
            "Not only is this book very moving, but it is one of the most popular historicals ever. Albeit, I did think it was long and I sometimes got tired of reading about struggle after struggle and pain over and over, this is the kind of book that shows the strength of people. When you get done with this book, it will leave you satisfied.",
            "Gone With The Wind is a passionate,heartthrobbing,beautiful,romantic tale.I saw the movie when I was 4 but it didn't make much of an impression on me because when I began reading it in bookstores when I was 6 I was immediatley enthralled with the story of Scarlett O'Hara,the sweet Southern Belle that when the War made many hard changes in her life she became a woman that did what she felt like and didn't listen to other peoples disapproval.Margaret Mitchell has brought many hours of joy to me as I read from her wonderful book every day of my life.I love Scarlett very much as the main character but Melanie is more dear to me.She is a beautiful,shining,kind woman that always saw Scarlett's and Rhett's good.She goes to show what we have lost from that era.Many people hate Ashley and think he's a wimp but that's only his potrayal in the movie.In the book,he is like Rhett but takes diffrent paths in the same situations.All the characters in this book,the lovely description,and the era make this book\"my favorite book of all time\".",
            "This is one of the most fascinating book that I have ever read.In its sweep, it focuses not only on slavery but also on the impact of war (however justified or inevitable) in people's lives. Scarlett's character is brilliant. Her transformation from a butterfly to a tough woman who loves her land, her struggles against poverty and her determination to rise above it, her passionate nature are just some of the remarkable features of this book. Its almost as if in the character of Scarlett, the author has put in all the dreams, hopes and aspiration of America of the mid 1800's. The description of life in the south makes the book all the more enchanting. Above all, its a great romance- A wonderful summer read. Scarlett's character, could be the voice of many women across the world even today.",
            "It has been said that all fantasy books are &quot;Lord of the rings&quot; progenies. If true, then all romance books have &quot;Gone with the wind&quot; roots. Every hero worth fantasizing about has Rhett's dash and every heroine seems to have Scarlett's spunk.I first read this book after years of loving the romance genre. It was already some 5 decades written and the author was long gone but I remember thinking: &quot;Wow, so this was how it all started.&quot;",
            "This is a book that really made me think about human nature, about how we sometimes get stuck with an idea, a person or a memoire that no longer is what we think it is. Like Scarlet spending her life loving Ashley with all her heart, but what she really loved was an illusion, ironically the illusion of what Rhett truly was.",
            "There ae some books you read, love and remember forever. This was one of them. If you hesitate to read this just because it is such a popular book, or you think that it's a romance novel, DON'T. I read it a couple years ago, well after I was out of highschool. I didn't think that I would care for it. Boy, was I wrong.I was hooked just a couple pages into the book. I felt like I knew these people. I could not put the book down. It was one of those books you just can't wait to read and you drag it with you wherever you go, in hopes of being able to sneak in a page or two.Read this book. It will leave an imprint on you. I wanted so much to keep reading after it stopped that I tried to read the &quot;sequel&quot; (written by a different author) and was unimpressed. I returned the book after reading the first paraghraph. There's nothing like Margaret Mitchell's Scarlet.",
            "Review of Gone With the Wind By Chris WilliamsThe novel ''Gone With the Wind'', by Margaret Mitchell, is one of the stories that has stood the test of time and is still loved by many people. It is used as a building block for many modern love and war stories. This story is about war and about a woman's struggle to obtain the man she loves, or the one she thinks she loves. The main character, Scarlet O'hara has an inner conflict of who she loves, while a civil war goes on around her. It's a traggic story of how she marries men while thinking she loves another, Ashley Wilkes. The other main character, Rhett Butler, really does love Scarlet more than anyone else, but when Scarlet finally realizes that she loves Rhett, and not Ashley, it's too late and he leaves her. Both Rhett and Scarlet are very selvish throughout the story. Rhett's only concern is how much money he can make off of the war, and all Scarlett cares about is trying to win Ashley's heart away from his wife, Melanie Hamilton. This plot kept me reading and it kept me very intrigued, I kept wanting to see what else would happen to keep Scarlet from realizing she loved Rhett. Scarlet's struggle and the loss of her and Rhett's daughter Bonnie were key factors in keeping this story exciting. I think anyone should read this book, boys or girls could enjoy this classic novel about love and war. It is one of the best books I have ever read in my life.",
            "I LOVE this book! It is one of the only books I know of where the dialogue is so great that the dialogue in the movie was taken almost word-for-word from the book! And this definitely was the perfect role for Vivien Leigh, one of my favorite actresses.I just acquired a 1936 hardcover version of the book. I love old books and this will go terrifically with my collection. I feel like this copy could be the one Vivien Leigh read over and over before she got the role. She kept telling everyone she was going to get it, and they kept trying tons of other actresses for the role, finally giving it to Vivien Leigh!Gone With the Wind is an epic novel of great proportion, set in the dwindling Old South. A southern belle who doesn't believe in war or anything but her own affairs strives to control her passion for a married man while marrying three men for money. Her third marriage, to Rhett Butler, is complicated by their passionate, obsessive love for each other, which makes the book and the movie what they are. A classic, the book is also contemporary because many women today can find their own selves in the book. I feel an affinity for Scarlett. Hopefully, many other women are like the wonderfully kind Melanie Hamilton.",
            "The thing i just love about this book is the fact that the novel is literally identical, to the film and that is no mean feat, at times it can grate slightly, but the book is so astoundingly written that you overcome that, she mitchell has that incredible deepness that only people from the deep south have when telling a story and no one else has the ability to convey.It has every thing war, when war was romantic,a dashing rogue of a hero, and of course the herione and was there ever a herione like scarlett o hara.One of the most important times in americas history and all this played in front of the backdrop of the deep south.in one word astounding.",
            "Easily the best piece of American fiction I have ever read. It is not only one of the most touching love stories of all time &quot; Did it ever occur to you that I loved you as much as a man can love a woman ?&quot; is one of most beautiful things I have ever heard a man say to a woman - it is an amazing depiction of Civil War history, told from the southern perspective. And Rhett just spoils you - because you keep comparing every man you meet with him and they just don't come even close. Despite the fact that I'm a woman, when I read the book, I identified far more with Rhett as a heroic character then I did with Scarlett, because he is so unabashedly honest about why he does things, and he has courage to say and do things because he believes in them, even if the community he is a part of is too shortsighted or too willfully blind to see the truth of what he says. Scarlett is just a hardheaded egocentric little brat, and the only admirable part of her personality is her neverending grit and determination to survive against all odds during Reconstruction despite incurring the wrath of her society. But personally despite the fact that Rhett thinks they're right for each other, because they're both rebels, I personally think she's too stupid for him, she just never thinks about anything except what she wants and how she's going to get it. But I suppose going by the time in which the book was written women were expected to be stupider than men. Of course, in some parts of the world, including where I come from, it's still considered a good thing. Rhett is the best thing that happened to Scarlett, that's definete, though whether she's the best thing to happen to him is questionable. Maybe if he'd been able to stretch her mind and her heart a little while they were married I would think she was good enough for him. Aside from the personal story which has resoundingly real characters and the epic tale of the Old South, this book ( and the movie ) serves as stunning anti-war statement. It makes you realize how terribly futile and a waste of effort, resources, and most of all people, war can be. Anyone who misses this book has missed out on something wonderful. And as far as the end is concerned, it was really no more then she deserved after ignoring him for years and years, but of course you do want to know they eventually end up together, because you know that they will make each other happy.",
            "If you're a fan of the movie, you HAVE to read the book. It is packed with details the movie doesn't even touch. Plus I think the book is actually more entertaining, believe it or not. Reading the novel enables you to better understand the principal characters and the environment of the Old South. The movie, even though it is 3 1/2 hours long, is really a huge abridgement of the novel. So much is missing from the film. After you've read the book you'll understand what I mean. Finally, if you do read the novel, prepare yourself, because it is quite long and requires concentration to keep track of the vast amount of characters and scenes. Anyway, this is the best novel I've ever read, and I generally don't read novels.",
            "In the book Gone With the Wind, Margaret Mitchell accurately portrays both the struggles and triumphs of living in the Civil War-torn South. Through the characters of Scarlett, Rhett, Ashley and Melanie, she shares with us the many opposing viewpoints of the Civil War. Gone With the Wind is a book that is timeless due to its amazing ability to stun readers with its stark truth. Everyone can relate to at least one character: hot-headed, poverty-fearing Scarlett; her husband, the child-doting blackguard Rhett; gentle, sweet Melanie, whose love for the Cause is greater than anything; and and Ashley, the hater of all wars. For these reasons, I rate Gone With the Wind five brilliantly shining stars!",
            "&quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; is one of my favorite stories. As a writer and publisher I admire not just the craft of Margaret Mitchell but also that of her publisher. You do not find such excellence in editing and proofreading in today's books. This is one of those books so good, you find yourself turning again to the first page as soon as you've finished it!--Linda Donelson, author of &quot;Out of Isak Dinesen: Karen Blixen's untold story&quot;",
            "This was the best book I have ever read. I admit that it starts out slowly, but the rest of the book is well worth it. After reading the first chapter, I thought it was the most boring book in the world. But I kept on reading because of all of the wonderful things I have heard about Gone With The Wind. I was unable to put this novel down! I was engrossed in the story of the Old South. I highly recommend this book. It will be an experience you will never forget!",
            "Gone With The Wind is one of my favorite books as well as a favorite movie. Margaret Mitchell has relayed thestory as though she was actually there. How does she know so many small details? Are they real or imaginary?Well, fiddle dee dee! They do seem real. This will be the 4th time that I have read the book. Saw the movieat age 14 on my first date. Cried and cried. And when we broke up that boyfriend told me that frankly, hedidn't give a damn.",
            "Loved the book. If only Rhett and Scarlett could have been on the same page at the same time. I know they loved each other. Scarlett is so strong if only she could have stayed out of her own way.",
            "I have read this book a few times, seen the movie 32 times, so I LOVE this book. I learn something new about the civil war and the customs of the time every time I read this story. It is so beautifully written. This particular edition I purchased is a true gem. It is beautifully bound and truly a book I can pass down through the years. It was every bit as good as the seller said it was!",

            "My most favorite book and move of all time. I had not read the book since high school and 50 years later, it still is my most favorite book. I also read &#34;Scarlett&#34; and &#34;Rhett Buttler's People&#34; - sequels to Gone with the Wind. Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!",
            "If you're like me and Gone with then Wind has ranked as your favorite movie of all time, you won't be disappointed with this read. All 1,037 pages while worth the read. And I was pleasantly surprised how much more detail and different the book was than the movie. As awesome as the movie was, the book is even better! A must read for all true southerns!",
            "Most incredible read. I highly recommend it to all age groups. So beautifully written it was so though I was brought to scene of the story.",
            "Love the book and the movie. The books so are I am only about a quarter of the way through but it is great",
            "An American classic historical novel. Not only a great story, but also lets you feel the changes wrought in society by the U.S. Civil War in and near Atlanta.",
            "Margaret Mitchell clearly captured the heart and view of the Confederacy during and after the Civil War. Her vivid descriptions of people and places make it easy to visualize the story. Her attention to detail and accuracy make GWTW believable window into the lives of 1860s Georgia.Her style of writing is easy to read and lazily draws you back to the Antebellum South until you find yourself an intimate observer of a lifestyle based on an economy of slavery. Mitchell's book doesn't apologize or campaign for the institution, it just presents a picture of what was.I find I revisit Gone With the Wind every ten years or so, and each read brings a new light to a classic novel.",
            "Its an unforgettable experience. When i read this book, i was not aware of any hype about this book. I just remeber the day i read this book in the library, back in India. Its a sunny morning. I just picked this book from the reference section, as i was waiting for some card or something, and started reading it. It was 7 in the morning, Few minutes would have gone,i think becuse, i have shifted myself a little. Suddenly somebody tapped me on the shoulder. Its the librarian. She said its 10 at night ans she is closing the library. She allowed me to take the book with me and I read it on and on until 8 in the morning, which was when i finished it. For 24 hours without food and sleep, without even a silghtest glance away from the book.Wahw Its truely an incredible experience.For one whole day i was beside the Scarlett, mind and soul.It is at that moment, i decided if Americans are down to earth as those characters, then it should not be very bad place and i came to America. After i came here and what i found, Its totally different story!!!",
            "I read this amazing novel approximately two years ago, since then I have read it several more times. It only took me about one week to read, I was so wrapped up in it that I put off homework to read it, I simply couldn't put it down. Believe me I don't read anything that fervently, other than Gone With the Wind. It is so descriptive, it wraps you up in this amazing story of love lost and lives, wasted on petty things. I personaly felt for the characters, being a hellraiser myself, I truely felt for Scarlett's plight and pain. I think that if you are a person who can be unaffected by all the media hype put into things, and just read this book you will be swept away by it's dazzling imagry and depiction of life and love and loss.",
            "I am turning 13 now, and I first read this book when I was only 11 years old. It took me a while, but it was worth it. Gone With the Wind is the best book I have ever read so far! I loved it so much. It was very interesting, and I couldn't put it down. At some really exciting parts, I felt almost as if I were in it. This book was definitly the best book I have ever read and I recommend it to anybody.",
            "Gone with the wind was a story about a sothern girl who live in the southern part of the united states. The story tells how her life was before, during and after the civil war, She started as a bratty teenager who turn into a heartless woman,who hurt her sister and push a way a man who turly loved her. She let moeny take over her mind and soul. The stroy also goes on to tell how the civil war had on the south part of the united states.. this is a good book to read.",
            "one of the clasics and most loved books. my mom's favorite (and now mine!) she forced me to read it to improove my english and after a while i loved it! the story is sooo great, the characters are very interesting and are beautifuly descripted (as everything in this book- situations, etc.) if you liked the movie you'll love the book! Mitchell has done a great job! i can't describe the filling of reading it! it truly carries you away for a while! you think you're actualy there. it's a wonderful book!!!",
            "I loved this book! It was written in a descriptive language, but it was a level that everyone could understand. Maybe that's why people love the story. There is always one character (at least) that you can identify with. Just a warning, don't read it and expect to know all about the Civil War. It will talk about it, but it concentrats (spelling, sorry) more on Rhett and Scarlett than the war. Some say that it was racist. Slavery was wrong, there is no doubt about that, but there were always different kinds of masters. The masters in GWTW were obviously kind ones. This presents the way the South saw the war, which was very VERY hard on them. Read it and do yourself a favor. Just a suggestion, though, watch the movie first (which is also excellent) and then read the book so you won't be dissappointed with the differences.",
            "Yes, I would recommend this book to my friend because I think anyone who loves to read about history would love this book. And also anyone who loves to wear ball gowns would love to read about all the costumes Scarlett wears in this book. Over all anyone could love to read this book.",
            "I must admit, before I read the book, I watched the movie! And I liked it so much, I picked up the book and read it cover-to-cover in a matter of days! I absolutely could not put it down! Scarlett is my all-time favorite female charactor, and the whole setting is wonderful. If you have not read this book yet, what are you waiting for?",
            "I first read this book at 16 and it was the first (and about the only) book that would make me get butterflies in my stomach. Mitchell's language is very easy to read. Although some of the characters have what I consider character flaws, by in large the novel is quite entertaining.",
            "This is the best book ever written. Margeret Mitchell is the best author of all time and Gone With the Wind is both the best novel and movie of all time. I can't get much better than this description of the South. It never has a dull moment and the only ones who don't fully enjoy it is those who cannot understand it.",
            "a book about romance usually bores me. It's no more than datings and marriages and divorces and remarries and who loves who. But definitely not this one. Mitchell has set an example on how to write a great romantic novel. And it's not merely a romance, it's a historical romance. And Mitchell was not merely an author, either, she was a historian. I see this book from three perspective; as a reader, a woman, and a college student majoring in International Relations. As a reader, I surely recommend this book to anyone, especially those interested in Civil War, American History and last but not least, romance. But one small tip, you might consider reading this book during your long break, since it's hard to put it down. As a woman, I view Scarlett O'Hara is a pure material girl, until life gives her valuable lessons about losing all the people she actually loves all her life that she did not realize before. But Mitchell created a good balance by adding a lot of good personality traits; hard working, courageous and brave. I admire especially her fast maturity she got after the O'Haras lost their once prosperous plantation and her high ambition to bring it back to a great plantation after Civil War did a damage to it. Also, Scarlett values richness not just for the money and pleasure it brings, although she did say several times that money is the most valuable thing in life. She also values richness to satisfy her dreams to see the world. As a Southern woman ( well-bred too ) on her time, Scarlett surely was one of the few who values brain beside beauty , which she shows by running her second husband's store and lumber yard and not a bit pay any attentions to other Atlanta ladies who despise her. Scarlett might be full of airs and graces, but she keeps it in the right place and the right time. Thirdly, as an international relations student, this book is qualified as a history book on the Civil War. Mitchell added a great deal of details not only about Civil War but also about slavery, which brought me to give more credits to her. A lot of book about slavery in the South view black slaves only as those who were looked down by their white masters. But not in Gone With The Wind.Mitchell viewed them as part of the family who had their white masters' full trust, like Pork, Mammy and Uncle Peter. It is the first time I found out that they also had something as social status in those days by being owned by different kind of white masters.",
            "This novel is a great piece of historical fiction, and it's not just for women, either. Set in the American Civil War, the story is about the life of a Georgian Southern Belle who is abruptly thrust from her pampered plantation life into the harsh realities of a very brutal war. Only her courage, strength, and resourcefulness get her through the wartime travails. That, however, is only the beginning of her struggles. After the war Scarlett faces the challenges of poverty, loneliness and death. She ends up being married three times (and burying two of her husbands), owning her own businesses, killing a soldier (and stealing the money and goods in his pockets), and generally doing everything considered unladylike at the time. Fictional characters set in an historic time, this book is a classic in every sense of the word. I've read it countless times (I still get something new out of it each time) and it should be in every well-read persons library. The movie of the same name follows the story closely (although some things had to be left out in the interest of time), stars Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable, and is widely regarded as one of the best films ever made.",
            "This has to be the best book ever written. You abosolutly will love this book. While Scarlette acts like one you would detest, you can't help but love her and all the other characters. If you've only seen the movie, you are in for a huge suprise. Lets just say Bonnie is not the only baby.",
            "This novel is a spactacular piece of work! At first the size of it scared me a bit, as it would most people my age, but boy am I glad I decided to read it! Scarlett is an amazing character, and the history is great. If you haven't read this classic, you are really missing out on something.",
            "Although I'm only 13, I have already read this compelling novel twice and am trying buy the book so I can read it even more! You feel like you are Scarlett's shadow, following all her movements and peeking into her mind and seeing her reasoning for her actions. My fave book!!",
            "This is a book that I believe everyone should absoluely read. From the first page to the very last you are entrolled into the deep south. The literate is beautiful as long as the glorious love story. I spent all my free time reading this book and was always thinking about Scarlet and what would happen next. This is the book that I would recommend to anyone, a lover of literature or not. When I finished the book and wiped the tears from my eyes, I was sad it was over. I wanted to go back and live in the time with Scarlet and never wanted it to end. Once is never enough with this masterpiece.",
            "This book was really good-it seemed to come alive as I read it. The main character is really amazing-not a friendly person-but she does stuff every one else was too nervous to do. Even though she grumbled all the way. Read it- but skip Alexandra Ripley's Scarlett. I'm sure she did her best, and GWTW is not an easy book to follow up, but it is nowhere NEAR this book.",
            "What can I say that hasn't already beign said? I think this is the most entertaining book of all time, not to mention historically accurate...I read it for the first time when I was 16 and in high school, and to my surprise, when we studied the Civil War a few months later in school, I already knew most of the battles, generals and dates! LOL :=)...this book is a gem.One more thing...though I think the movie is an absolute masterpiece and a must-see, I nevertheless think it doesn't do the book justice. It ommits too much. The movie doesn't show us Gerald's story and how he ran away from County Meath, Ireland straight into Georgia, Ellen's heartbreak when Phillippe Robillard was murdered and her resolve to run away frome her memories; but mainly, and what truly makes me sad...the movie doesn't develop the myriad other characters. What I mean is, it focuses on Scarlett, Rhett, Ashley and Melanie. However, the novel tells us of India and Honey Wilkes, Cade and Cathleen Calvert, Tony and Alex Fontaine, Sally and Dimity Munroe, the four Tarleton girls...you get to know so many stories...and since I truly loved all these characters, I missed them in the movie. Of course, there would have never beign enough time in a movie to cover all this...but, perhaps a miniseries could :=).P.S. By the way, in the novel, Brent and Stuart Tarleton were two very cool, masculine guys, as opposed to the dancing idiots we are shown in the beginning of the movie ;=) !",
            "This book is so overwellming we dont know how to tell you. even the begining of the book starts out wonderful, ful of detail, characteristics and a sense of humor. the plot is wonderful, and its not at all like an ordinary book. it shows emphuism and spirit as well as a sense of characters and people. this is a wonderful book and trust me if u think its to long, it isnt it actally is to short. u just have to start reading it, then youll get what i mean.",
            "This book is very attention grabbing it keeps you interested and is one of those books where you always &quot;just have to read one more chapter!&quot; Margret Mitchell is a true genius, and a very gifted writer. If you haven't seen the movie yet, I suggest you read the book first, you'll apretiate the movie more! The motion picture that was produced is the only one I know of that truly lived up to the book it was made after",
            "I first read this book when I was a teenager. It has never lost its appeal to me. This epic saga emcompasses all of the major elements -- love, war, history, and memorable characters -- particularly the charismatic, witchy heroine Scarlett O'Hara and her male counterpart, Rhett Butler. Starting when Scarlett was sixteen, and the belle of the county, with dozens of beaus, she quickly moves with the times when war sweeps the antebellum South. In love with bookish, sensitive Ashley, she sees him off to the Civil War while marrying someone else, just because Ashley married someone else. She is quickly widowed, and journeys to Atlanta to stay with relatives. She has her eye on Rhett Butler, a stockade captain who plans to make money out of \"the fall of a civilization.\" For everything about the old life is being swept away in war -- \"cotton, slaves, and arrogance.\" Over the course of the novel, she slowly discovers who she truly loves, and goes for him. But he is too proud to reveal his true feelings for her, as she stubbornly clings to another man. Saving her plantation home from carpetbaggers, she decides to marry Rhett. It takes two tragedies for her to find out who has been saving her as a damsel in distress all of these years, and that he \"loves her to distraction.\" The novel is full of truths and themes that coincide again and again -- love triangles, the fall of an era and who survives the times in style, and friendship, family, and true love.",
            "Gone With the Wind was a fantastic book. It's about this young woman, Scarlett O'Hara, who is living during the Civil War-in the south. Her rich and perfect life is ruined once the south loses the war and she is thrown into a time of starvation and misery. She becomes a widow and has to face those troubles as well.Mitchell created the character, Scarlett, wonderfully. She had spunk, determination, intelligence, and selfishness-traits that made her personality interesting. She does what ever she needs to get her by. Then there's Rhett. He's this dashing man who is no gentleman. I have to say, he brought a little bit of light into the dark parts of the book. He seems to be just a rude, mischevious man at first, but later on, Mitchell makes his character more full, shall I say. His character is deep and full of emotion and feelings-I really can't describe it.Then Margaret Mitchell created a bond and passion between these two characters. It was a wonderful romance, with love and anger-a sort of bittersweet romance. I felt I could connect with these characters.I loved this novel; I couldn't put it down. I read it at a young age, 11 to be exact, but I was into it none the less. It kept me hooked for 7 weeks until I finally finished it. It's long-really long-but absolutely worth it. I loved it, loved it, loved it! This book tied together historical fiction and romance, my favorite types of books, into one novel. It is a book not to be forgotten-ever.",
            "I am only 11 years old. Still, no one stopped me from reading the classic, Gone With the Wind. I encourage myself. When I started reading the book, I got so caught into Scarlett, Ashley WIlkes, Melanie, and Rhett Butler, that I felt as if I were living with them as well! When I got to the end of the book, I felt as if Margaret Mitchell had left out something very valuable, like she hadn't really meant to publish the un-finished book! I am getting very crazy about Gone With the Wind, and it's truly the first book that I can ever say sincerely that was my \"Favorite book\" ever! For anyone who thinks Gone With the Wind's words are too small, or that the book is too \"mushy and gushy for us,\" it's not! It's a nice, sad romance novel that I shall remember forever. Please read it. I am currently asking for the book, in hardcover original edition, for my birthday.",
            "Scarlett: you love her, you hate her. Rhett: the lovable rogue that every romance hero is measured against. An epic romance set in the antebellum era, &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; gives you a portrait of the timeless southern belle who has it all, loses it all, gets it back and - loses it again? Mitchell's fans will forever regret that she never got the chance to answer the question.",
            "This novel definitely stands the test of time, still as good as it was when I read it over 20 years ago. A great romance combined with great historical detail. Rhett Butler is still my favorite character, brilliant, sarcastic, flippant. So many people do not read this because of the movie, but the movie is a pale imitation. Please Read It! You won't regret it.",
            "I had not seen the movie before picking this up to read, so reading this book proved to be a real treat. I was immediately drawn into both Scarlett's and Rhett's characters. The way in which their lives wove in and out of each other's was beautifully told. Mitchell presented them as real multi-dimensional people, with both good and bad qualities. When I saw the movie after completing the book, I was completely disappointed with it. While the movie stayed fairly true to the book (not changing anything important), it DID omit several things that I think were crucial to understanding Scarlett in particular. (I won't ruin it for your readers.) I HIGHLY recommend this book, even if you've seen the movie. It has quickly replaced The Count of Monte Cristo as my new favorite book of all time.",
            "When I first started reading this book, I was like, &quot;ok, great, another borefest...&quot; but Gone With the Wind soon became one of my favorite books of all times! Scarlett and Rhett were some of the best characters I had ever encountered. A 5 star timeless classic!",
            "I just finished this book yesterday, and I can't stop thinking about it. Seriously an amazing story. The writing, the characters, the details, and the historical context were all perfect!I LOVED this book. Everyone should read it!",
            "I first read GWTW when I was a teenager and recently reread it after reading several books about strong women. The book is just as good as I remembered. Stories about brave women who keep moving forward have always inspired me. If you have never read GWTW, do yourself a favor and take the leap. Mitchell takes you right into the heart of a time that affected all Americans. Living in Atlanta where the book was set makes it even more appealing to me. After you finish this book, take a chance and read about other strong women that are alive and well, even as I write this. I was blown away by Mayada Al-Askari, in Mayada, Daughter of Iraq.",
            "I just loved this book! Filled with human drama, emotional conflict over basic values, and set against a war for civil justice. I saw the movie seven times! But the book was seven times better! I plan on reading it until the pages wear so thin that I can see right through them! Gone With the Wind beats any other book I've read including like my math book. This is the right way to study history! Signed: An enthusiastic 12 year old! ;-)",
            "This is one of the best fictions I have read in American literature. It narrates the personal struggle of our not always likable but always resilient and resourceful heroine Scarlett O'Hara, and her relationship with the cynical and worldly Rhett Butler. It is also a sweeping saga of the people of the American South (mostly two locales in Georgia: Tara Plantation and Atlanta), spanning from antebellum to Civil War to the Reconstruction. Michell's writing is superb; it is full of details and nuances to the southern life, especial life in the plantations and life in Atlanta. The personalities of the characters are consistent and believable. Even descriptions of minor events and characters are vivid, such as the conversion between Gerald O'Hara and Mrs. Tarleton and her daughters on the way to the barbecue, from the chorus of the girls' shrieking and arguing you really get a rich and lively picture of antebellum Southern life. Of course, we shouldn't confuse the author's nostalgic and overly-romanticized view of Southern plantation life with reality, but this is a fiction, not a historical study. I find it hard to fault the author for painting a picture from the perspective that she chose (that is, a white plantation owner's perspective), just like you cannot criticize a painting of peaceful rural scenery for not exposing the garbage dump and outer house.But the book is not without flaws, and I see two major ones:1. Racism. I don't think anyone can really defend the author for this. It is one thing that her characters say and think in racist terms, but she also expressed such opinions numerous times in the narrator's voice. Some defend her by saying that it is because of the time (1920s-1930s) that Michell wrote this book; that may be true, but it does not exempt her from such criticism. I would rather say it is a \"flaw of her time\" than \"not a flaw because of her time\".2. The reconstruction part (Part Four) of the book is a little dragging. Some tangential characters such as Will Benteen and Archie introduced in this part are an awkward fit to the storyline and they certainly do not add much to the central plot (not surprisingly, they were completely eliminated in the movie). In this period Butler's role also became more shadowy, except at the end when he rescued the men from their ill-fated Shantytown revenge. I get a sense that Mitchell was really critical of the reconstruction and she was just drawing this out to give herself more room to air her criticism.Nevertheless, even with these flaws, it is really an exquisitely crafted piece of work. It will always have its place in the Alta of American literature.",
            "It started very slow for me, with Scarlett's fleeting thoughts about her dresses and balls. Then every time it became intriguing the conflict resolved itself, except for the conflict between Scarlett and Rhett which only gradually compounded. The d&eacute;nouement was poignant and well conceived-- perhaps it's just the romantic in me but I choose to see the end as just the beginning.",
            "I loved that book and i couldn't put it down. It is one of the few books that just keep you occupied in your mind long after you finished it.",
            "I never read the book before, saw bits of the movie and have heard so much about it that I thought I should buy it and add it to my literary collection. It's thicker than other versions and the print is small, if that is no problem then go ahead and buy it. My version had a few weird quirks like accordian pages and uncut pages which caused it to protrude from the book and there were ink smudges as well.Content wise, I found the book to be well written and I enjoyed Margaret Mitchell's use of imagery. The words flowed, the book was interesting and of course you're going to love Rhett Butler. This isn't a true depiction of slavery and you shouldn't use it as insight into how life was like during the Civil War, although it might give you some idea and it's interesting to read from the Southerner's point of view. Obviously there will be some annoying aspects. I found it difficult to understand the slaves and skimmed through most of their dialogue and of course you might even get annoyed that the slaves were depicted as their most loyal pets that never question their masters and didn't want their freedom.But if you considered what time it was written and by whom, then it shouldn't dampen your enjoyment of your book. It's a book everyone should read. It really is good literature and worthy of the prize it won.",
            "Why would someone want to read a story about some spoiled rich girl? It is all in the art of the storytelling, and Mitchell is a master at the craft. It has been 16 years since I read this story and I can still remember the first sentence. As soon as I read it I was hooked. Although this is mainly a love story there is more to it than meets the eye. Mitchell takes us back in time into the very midst of the civil war. It is viewed from the perspective of Scarlett who cannot fully comprehend what is going on around her, yet the reader can feel an indescribable sense of loss through her story. During her trials, she perseveres and discovers a sense of strength within herself previously unknown. Great historical romance.",
            "I really can't describe how I feel about this book and about Scarlett. She is a character without parallel. You can't help admiring her even when you deplore her for her failings. Amazing.",
            "I loved the movie. It's actually one of my favorite movies but the book puts it to shame. The book is brilliant. It's masterfully detailed without belittling it's reader. Beautifully tragic.",
            "No other piece of work has ever captured the Old South quite like \"Gone With The Wind.\" I highly recommend this classic to any person who wants to learn more about this vanished world.",
            "I was amazed at how interested I was in a classic - I have always thought and saw them to be pretty good books -although some modern ones definitly outshine them. But Gone With the Wind was a tearing, heartbreaking classic, the book so heartfelt. I could certainly relate to almost all things in the book. It truly showed a real look into humaity - something I think many people need to do these days.",

            "This is one of the best books ever.",
            "(4.5 stars, actually)I've never seen the movie all of the way through; every time it's been on I've either tuned in after it started or had to eat dinner, go to bed, or something that necessitated my having to interrupt my viewing of it. Reading the book finally got across the story in one piece. I normally dislike what Hollywood does to books adapted for the screen, but after reading the book, I agree that this is one of the few exceptions. And if you liked the movie, the book will be even better because of all of the characters and events left out (such as Scarlett's older two children Wade and Ella). One thing the movie was right to leave out, however, was the stomach-churning racism.I have no problem with an author having characters spout viewpoints that are racist (sexist, anti-Semitic, homophobic, etc.), but here those viewpoints aren't just limited to their dialogues and inner thoughts. There are a LOT of editorial commentaries on, for example, how wonderful slavery was, how the only good slave is one that was happy to be a slave, and all of the old stereotypes about African-Americans (sexual predators, lazy, childlike, superstitious, easily frightened, snoops, liars, thieves, you name it). The word &quot;Negro&quot; is never even capitalised, and many times the other n word is used to refer to them, as in &quot;a niggery smell&quot; and &quot;trashy free-issue niggers.&quot; I know that in 1936 no one was saying African-American or even Black, but at least you could capitalise the word Negro or not use the word &quot;darky&quot; so often! Many of the African-American characters even call themselves and members of their own race the n word. These slaves support their white masters, hating the slaves who dare feel themselves equal to whites and who wanted to be free. There are also two anti-Semitic slights; on page 734 it says of Hugh Elsing (who is incompetent and not very smart in business) &quot;Anyone could Jew him down on prices.&quot; On page 759 Rhett asks Scarlett if she might have some Jewish &quot;blood&quot; in her as well as Irish blood because of her love of money. The real reason Scarlett hires convicts to work in her mill is because they're cheaper, easier to exploit, and less &quot;uppity&quot; than the &quot;trashy free-issue&quot; former slaves. What other book with such racism on nearly every page is still in print today?Most Southerners were Crackers and white trash, not rich aristocrats like Scarlett and her friends, yet there's not one good word to be found about the Crackers. You'd think the aristocrats were in the majority and that barely any slaves were ever mistreated or had just cause to run away. They didn't even see how ironic it was that they were in the destitute position that the Crackers and slaves had been in for generations. The racism gets even more frequent and ugly in Part Two, the Reconstruction era. You'd never know that the KKK were a terrorist organisation; we're supposed to applaud these racist murderers and feel bad that the Yankees have taken over control? The only Southern state to avoid martial law was Tennessee, because they ratified the 14th Amendment. But of course, the other Southern states were too proud and angry to do that. And they got what they wanted before long; Reconstruction ended, African-Americans were effectively barred from exercising their Constitutional rights to vote for almost a hundred years, the Republicans (who were the progressive party way back when) were hounded out of town and threatened away from the polls, and the rich white men regained monopoly over the polls. The way it's written, you'd think the newly freed slaves, the Republicans, and the &quot;Scallawags&quot; were the ones going around terrorising people instead of the Democrats and the KKK! Still, the racism isn't the main point of the story, so I can overlook it to a point since the rest of the story is so great.The characters in the book are even better than in the movie; here Rhett isn't some charming rake, he's downright nasty, sleazy, seedy, suspicious, like an interesting-evil villain on a soap opera, the bad guy whose motivations are interesting and not mean for the sake of meanness. He's an incredible match for Scarlett, a strong empowered woman in her day and age, not afraid to flount social conventions by going out in public pregnant or shortening the period of mourning after her husbands die, a woman who has the smarts and the guts to run her own businessess because her second husband is too soft-hearted and incompetent to run them properly himself. Ashley is also a lot better in the book; he's such a doofus in the movie, but here we can understand why Scarlett is in love with him all of these years, why he inspires such passion and devotion in this fiery woman, a woman who wouldn't have spent so much time and emotion on the wimp he's portrayed as in the movie!The book does a great job at showing a Southern pov in the Civil War and Reconstruction; it would have been perfect if there hadn't been so much repugnant racist editorialising and just presented the viewpoints of these people from a vanished way of life in an unbiased way. It just looks unprofessional, besides racist, for an author to constantly inject personal opinions into the text.",

The ending was disappointing, sad, and flat. Who wants to be left hanging with a book this good? No one! I plan to read the sequel, Scarlett. I figure the story line can't get much worse than how it ended in Gone With the Wind. Read it once just for the experience. You probably won't want to read it again.",
            "Ugh -- By the end of this book, you're going to want to slap Scarlett silly. I'm angry that I wasted the past month of my life reading this book. Mitchell must have been getting paid by the word because she goes on and on and on about nothing. This book could have easily been 600 or 700 pages shorter. The romance between Rhett and Scarlett is not believable. A cold, drab book. Save yourself the agony: rent the movie.",
            "I have to admit one thing about this book. She got her Civil War facts right, which is more than we can say for some authors who have tried writing novels about the war. Other than that, I have nothing good to say about this book.Scarlett is one of the most annoying characters you'll ever read about. I realize she's supposed to be that way, but frankly I didn't care what happened to her or anybody else in this book. She got on my nerves right from the start.My biggest problem with the book was how racist it was. Critics of Mark Twain call his books racist, but Tom and Huck are probably accurate portrayals of kids growing up in that time and place (at least regarding their thoughts on slaves). To have Tom Sawyer make a comment that sounds racist to us is one thing, but in this case the author shows her own racism. A slave who came back south after visiting Boston with a Union officer complains about being expected to sit at the dinner table with the white people, who obviously didn't know that the black people were inferior and should eat in the kitchen. This was probably her view when she wrote it, but if you could go back in time I doubt if you'd have found any slaves who didn't want their freedom, or who didn't want to be treated as equals by the white people of the time.I've never understood the popularity of this book or the movie. If you want to read a good Civil War novel try something by Howard Bahr or \"The Killer Angels,\" or \"A Soldier's Book,\" or \"Enemy Women,\" or \"The Red Badge of Courage,\" or \"Shiloh.\"",
            "Along with D.W. Griffith's \"A Birth of a Nation,\" this nostalgic and wish-fulfilling \"riches-to-rags-and-back-to-riches-again\" romp across Civil War history is more than just the archetypical racist American novel. Together the two constitute a kind of sub-cultural \"power-duo,\" that captures perfectly the mindset that ushered-in a century of American Apartheid, and arguably that still governs much, if not most of American culture. \"Gone With the Wind\" is literally \"cotton candy\" for the Conservative/racist/Southern American mind.In the most syrupy and sophomoric of prose (perhaps ever written by an American author), Mitchell lays it on heavily. Scarlet, the archetypical southern bitch flaunts and wields her unearned entitlements with great immoral facility, demonstrating that even when down and out, \"being white\" still \"counts\" for more than anything else. Even when ravaged by the Northern Yankee soldiers, being a \"Southern white woman\" still demands royal treatment, and commands the regal stage always hovering well above and over all the lower animals, and especially, and most notably, over all the blacker ones.Let us admit it up front: Gone With the Wind is an important novel only because of its slightly transparent racist subtext, which still resonates with a large reservoir of American thought, habits, feelings and culture. And although the structure of racism, which the book appeals to, still remains pretty much intact and unperturbed, it is no longer respectable to acknowledge it, or most of all to speak of it in other than \"coded language.\"Griffith's movie, and Mitchell's book are perhaps the first \"coded\" version of racism that captured perfectly the American mindset, and thus are both valuable in this respect alone. It is in this sense only that Gone With the Wind is perhaps the best of this genre - eventually spawning the like's of John Jake's series on the North and South, etc.Meaning no disrespect, and noting that it won the Pulitzer Prize, being the best of this genre does not suggest that the book is being measured against a very high standard. But despite this and despite it's mean-spirited, amoral and wish fulfilling subtext, it is not easy to deny that this novel has earned its place in the pantheon of American history and literature. Since it remains such an important nostalgic representation of the racist American way of life, and is the best of its genre, it deserves at least four stars.",

            "Hell, I just wasted the better part of my Sunday reading the last couple of hundred pages of this trash, always in the hope that somewhere, there had to be this twist which would make the book worth reading, but it just never came. I ended flinging the book across the room, disgusted. Character, heroism, intelligence, thoughtfulness? Things Scarlett certainly lacks can all be found in books like Inception (Harbinson) or even better: A Town like Alice (Shute). Please don't waste your time as I did....",
            "My father browbeat me into reading \"Gone With The Wind\" when I was a teenager. To this day I can't understand what all the fuss was about. Scarlet is such a spoilt snit that I couldn't care what happened to her. I guess this is one book you either love or hate, so I recommend that you check a volume out of the library and read a chapter or two. If you hate it, you've lost nothing but a little of your time. If you love it, well, there's no accounting for taste.",
            "Written during the Great Depression when Americans needed escapism, GWTW and the resulting movie it spawned are primarily responsible for distorting many Americans impressions of slavery, as well as trivializing the horror of the Civil War. If you like your history covered with moonlight and magnolias and sugar-coated beyond all reality GWTW is just what you are looking for. After all, its only fiction. Problem is, too many people over the years have come to regard it as almost gospel. In the end, GWTW is little more than a cheap attempt to create an American version of Tolstoy's &quot;War &amp; Peace.&quot;",

Each volume in this library has a beautifully decorated binding (similar to expensive leather bound books but much more reasonable in price) and when dispalyed as a set, the effect is stunning. I bought this copy as a Christmas gift for a friend in Austria who is an avid reader and book collector. As a European, I felt his library was incomplete without the greatest American novel ever written, Gone With The Wind. The copy is authentic and even though fairly old, it was in great shape! I highly recommend this seller and this set of masterpiece volumes for anyone who is considering assembling a library of literary master works.",

I should have read the comments closer and I would have known it was not a hardback--in which case I would not have purchased it. I do not feel it will remain in good condition for long and I am worried that the binding may work loose with reading and also will not store well on my shelf. I do not understand why this book was not offered in a hardback edition, after all, I would think most people purchase them to add to their collections and plan to keep them for many years.",
            "The book actually provides a well-balanced explanation of southern attitudes and responses to the Civil War, reconstruction,their \"culture\",womens place in society and class consciousness among both blacks and whites. Great history. But Scarlet and Rhett do get tiresome, I do understand better now what made them tick.",

            "My old paperback copy of \"Gone With The Wind\" was falling apart and so I decided to download it onto my Kindle. What a pleasure to read it again in this format! Readers who are curious about the author Margaret Mitchell might be interested in reading her biography \"Road to Tara\" by Anne Edwards.",

I started to read the book, thinking that I would hate it. But as the story line progressed, it grew on me more and more. I was enthralled with the strength and courage that Scarlett had. This book was way better than I thought it would be. But the ending, which made me cry, dissapointed me. And I threw a fit because I read such a long story with such a horrible ending. But I now realize that I was just too young to read this book in 7th grade. I'm in 8th grade now and maybe sometime soon I'll read it again and understand it better. After you read this book the story will stay in your mind forever. My favorite character, strangely enough, was Rene Picard.",
            "When I first got GWTW to read and saw how long it was I said to myself this is going to be bad and take forever to read, but I went on to read it not knowing why. Many of my friends thought I was crazy reading it, and frankly so did I. Well I started to read it and really got into it. It was so exciting and thrilling I never wanted to put it down. The story of Scarlett O'Hara really touched me and made me realize everthing that we take for granted in life. Also how if you want to be noticed in life and be remembered than be different. Scarlett did many bold things during the war, and even though she had trouble keeping husbands she finally fund a true love one whom she thought she hated. This book was full of surprises and throughly heart warming. It will make any reader make his or her outlook on life so much better, and give them more hope in a &quot;wacky&quot; and strange world like ours.",
            "Last Christmas, I received Gone With The Wind, and before I even went back to school, I had finished it. I read it all day for a week, and when I finished, I felt like my heart had been squeezed. It was so amazing. I have persuaded friends to read it, have posters of it hanging in my room, and simply love it!!! This is one of my favorite books!!!",
            "Just finished reading all the reviews people posted on GWTW and I'm overwhelmed by the love people have for this book. I'll admit it's not my all time favorite (that honor belongs to By Love Possessed, by James Gould Cozzens), but GWTW is still one of the greatest literary experiences a person can have. It's the type of book one simply disappears into, you have no concept of the outside world--your world is Tara, Twelve Oaks, Atlanta, and your friends are Scarlett, Rhett, Melanie, Ashley, et al. You forgive them their indescretions and love them for their humanity. Oh, and I hated the Alexandra Ripley sequel.",
            "I love this book. It is so heartbreaking, tragic, and romantic- it just kind of draws me to it. One of my best friends took three years to convince me to check it out of the library. Finally I did and I wish now that I hadn't waited so long. I'm 13, and I think this book is awesome, and I don't even like romances, and I haven't even finished it yet!!!! This is a must-read for anyone with a flair for the dramatic, and anyone who doesn't like it can just shut their mouths!!!",
            "The thing that stands out the most in my mind is how different it was from the movie. All the little extra things that happen in the book that don't happen in the movie (i.e. Scarlett has more than 1 child) Anyone who loves the movie owes it to themselves to read the book. Don't be put off by the number of pages. You'll come away thinking, Gee I only knew 1/2 the story!",
            "WOW. Possibly THE BEST book I have ever read. My mother took me to see th rerelease just recently at a theater in Dallas, and when it was over I didn't want to leave. I mean, the movie was 6+ hours long and I still wanted more!! So I went and bought the book. My favorite part has to be(besides the fall of Atlanta)the ball in which Rhett auctions Scarlett. It is a perfect example of their feelings for each other. I love all the characters. Timid Melly, Rash Scarlett, Careless Rhett. A must read!!!!",
            "This novel has it all! Where else can you read about love, honor, tradition and free enterprise? Given that she is a woman with charm, beauty and brain's, it's no wonder that the men in her life naturally &quot;flocked&quot; to her. I have read GWTW several times, and I still find myself more enthralled each time. I admire Scarlett's survival instinct, and her raw ambition. GWTW will forever be a timeless american classic!",
            "This is a timeless movie, people of all ages love it. I love the ending, it makes you use your own imagination on what happens after Rhett leaves. The so-called sequel was the biggest mistake the Maragret Mitchell estate could of ever made. As far as I am concerned, that book was no sequel, but a seperate book altogether. They can say whatever they want about Titanic, but let's see if it can last half as long as GWTW.",
            "I first watched the movie when I'm 14. Just totally obsessed by it and started to read the novel. I'm now 17 and had read the novel 3 times in Chinese and one time in English and watched the movie for 5 times. It is (will be) the best novel I had read... the novel is better than the movie, more better. Dont' read or watch the sequel!! You will disappointed. Scarlet and Rhett only live in Gone With The Wind. When it ask &quot; How do you rate this book?&quot; in this review. I just can't stop laughing. Can it be rated by stars?",
            "Margret Mitchell uses wonderful descriptions to show a way of life that has long disappeared from time. The characters are fantastic and the conflicts in the book are numerous: Scarlett's love for Ashley, Rhett's love for Scarlett, the plight to salvage a lost cause. I saw the book as more than a love story. It shows the many emotions people go through as they mature and change with the world they are presented with. Gone With the Wind should be a required book for anyone who enjoys this genre. The movie is also good, but it doesn't include everything the book has to offer. I laughed and cried, and even though it's long (around 1,000 pages), I loved every moment, and wished it were longer. (It got really good at the end and then it ended)",
            "Mind blowing! The book was amazing!! One of the best experiences of my life was reading it. The movie did not do anything much tho' the casting was superb. The sequel was pathetic, Alexandra Ripley: go boil your head! You're nowhere near the real thing!",
            "Gone With the Wind is, without a doubt, my one and only obsession. Since reading it at age 10, I have attempted to acquire everything that I have found to be associated with this extrodinary book. I am now 16 and my love for Gone With the Wind is still exceedingly strong. Alexandra Ripley's so-called sequel was good but her Scarlett and Rhett did not suit the originals. Margaret Mitchell was a superb author with a genious for portraying saucy, touch-me-not characters like Scarlett and smooth,arrogant ones like Rhett. Throughout the book Scarlett's insistance that she would always love Ashley and Rhett would never have that privilege perfectly led up to the ending where she finally realizes that she only wanted Ashley because she could not have him. Gone With the Wind is the best book ever written and in my mind that fact will never change.",
            "This is the best book in the world. If you haven't read it, you have to! This book is so real. You feel for Scarlett and cry with her and laugh with her. It's to hard for me to write in words how wounderful this book is. You have to read it to fell and understand it. If I were you I would drop everything and run to the store and buy, buy, buy it!",
            "When I first picked up Gone With the Wind, I thought that I would be reading it for the rest of my life. To be true, it only took a few weeks to finish and it was the one of the best books I have ever read. I thought that Margaret Mitchell was perfect in her way she described the Civil War with a romantic twist with it. I ended up reading this book for my Honors English class and it was worth every minute of it.",
            "'Gone with the wind' is one of the greatest love stories ever written. It has withstood the test of time and has emerged as a novel, absolutely unforgettable. I am not even American, yet Mitchell's art of writing and the vivid and real-like descriptions enrapture the reader's imagination crossing all regional boundaries. This book has to be bought and not borrowed, to enjoy its splendour completely.",
            "This has got to be one of my favorite books. Historically accurate and breathtakingly written, you get a real feel for what it was like to live in the Antibellum South. I actually finished the book thinking how much I hated Scarlett as a character, but her journey through life was a magnificent ride. I was actually glad that this book was so long, as I turned page after page and didn't want it to end. It's an accomplishment to finish such a lengthy work, but it was well worth the effort. I love this book.",
            "Gone with the wind was one of the best novel i have read so far. The story was so excited and you can't just quit reading it.It holds your emotions through out and you'll never get bore. The character of Scarlet O'Hara was the dominant one in the story but i don't understand why she always behave Rhett badly when he always loved her so much. The most sympethatic character was of Melanie who dies at the end; and she was the one who was taking caring of every body in the home. Ashely character was not bad but i don't know why he always think about the old south. Overall the story is the best.",
            "I simply love this book! I read it when I was 14.Its still the best I've ever read.I'm now 45. The film was good (seen it more than 5 times) but the book is even better. The sequel was a disappointment, the film Scarlet even worse. Nobody could ever write and feel like Margaret Mitchell.",
            "It takes you through the story of a girl that has everything and wants just what she can't have, and through the story of how her world fell around her. About Scarlett and her men, but never having her one love",
            "Gone with the Wind's anti-hero is captivating and complex. Scarlett is complex in her own mind, tormented about what she wants vs what's right to do, while she fights to survive during and after the Civil War. She is selfish and aware of it. Adding to the complexity of Scarlett, is her kindness that she affords others despite her selfish desire. While she is the daughter of a slave holder, she remains loyal to caring for her former slaves after the war and has a developed relationship with Mammy. Unfortunately, the social thread of America, and much of the world from Bible days going forward, thought nothing wrong of owning slaves. However, that social paradigm shifts as the story continues. Scarlett might be from a wealthy family, but she is still a female that bucks societal trends and owns and operates business. On occasion she is outright ruthless with men. In the end of the book she is \"punished\" for her misdeeds. However, her husband is not.It surprises me that many people compare GWTW to Birth of a Nation. The problem is we are viewing GWTW as if it can be held to today's value system. It does not. It cannot. It's not a book about human unity or human dignity. It's a book about surviving crisis and how some American's got through a war that killed 12% of the US population. In the 1920s and 30s the KKK was very strong in the South and perpetuated stories about black attacks on whites and many political groups argued that blacks were not fit for society. Using genteel approaches GWTW presents strong women who helped the south survive the war, it also showed blacks as \"southerners\" and caring people (Scarlett's life is saved at least twice by a black character in the book), it also suggests that war is not a wise solution. Scarlett gets away with voicing unpopular opinions \"war is a waste of time\", \"the south should just free the slaves\", \"why should women always stay quiet around men?\" because she's portrayed as an anti-hero. If she were a do-gooder she might come off differently. Pretend she had Melanie's \"kind nature\" combined with her practical and self serving criticism of \"states rights, sexism, & war\", she would be seen by many readers in the 1930s as almost being an abolitionist sympathizer. The book would have failed at that point in delivering it's message about survival. The message would be lost. Furthermore, it wouldn't express what many southerners already felt, a kinship and love of the land. When you read the last paragraph of the book you get a picture of what prevails in the south, the love of the earth, southern life, quiet country evenings and the simple relationship of Scarlett and Mammy (the only person she has left: her father and mother died, her friend Melanie died, daughter died and her husband left). Scarlett also realizes too late that she is in love with Rhett and losses him, just as the South realized too late that \"states rights\" cost them what they loved the most.",
            "GWTW, the great American epic, certainly earns its reputation by being a big sweeping novel of the collapse and rebuilding of the American south. Mitchell's research about the many battles in and around Atlanta is evident, as is her knowledge of Southern plantation and urban life. But despite all of her research, her personal bias is evident and clouds her recounting of history. Mitchell is a product of her times, Southern born and bred 70 years after the civil war. She believes that slavery was not so bad, and the slaves were treated like family and were protected and cared for. Her descriptions of free slaves in Atlanta makes one cringe, and she devotes half of chapter 37 to this narrative with quotes like, \"There they conducted themselves as creatures of small intelligence might naturally do. Like monkeys or small children turned loose among treasured objects...\" Another of her characters, Big Sam, a former slave on Tara has tried freedom and doesn't like it and is trying to make his way back to Tara where he knows he will be cared for again. Nowhere in the book does Mitchell make reference to the hard and inhumane lives slaves lived, and the fact that they were property with no rights or lives they could call their own. She even tries to justify the existence of the KKK, saying that the free blacks were running so amuck over of the whites that the Southern men, who had been stripped of their rights by the Yankees, had to do something to avenge these wrongs.Putting aside all of Mitchell's personal bias about slavery, I did enjoy this book and ultimately felt it was a many layered love story between Scarlett, Rhett, Melanie, and Ashley, all intertwined in matters of the heart. Scarlett, the central character and most interesting by far, is a modern woman ahead of her time. She is outspoken, strong-willed and a shrewd business woman. She does whatever it takes to get what she wants in affairs of business and the heart. She is a fully developed character with a range of emotions from pride and pettiness to compassion and understanding (although she tends to lean more toward the former emotions). At times we thoroughly dislike her, others we can relate to her, sometimes we pity her and occasionally we even cheer for her. Mitchell also spends time developing her other major characters, Rhett, Melanie and Ashley, and by the end we feel as if we really know all of them.Despite its 1,000 pages or 41 hours on audio cd, which I listened to, I never got bored, and in fact didn't want to end. The story always moved right along. Someone was always dying, getting married, having a baby, going to or planning a party, plotting, scheming, or getting into or out of trouble. It is melodrama at its best and I am so glad I actually read it instead of just seeing the abridged story in the form of the movie.",
            "wow. loved it. i will definitley be reading this book again and again. i always loved the movie but the book is simply amazing. such complex and interesting characters. its hard to believe the age of the book the style of writing seems ahead of its time. sorry for typos, on my kindle.",
            "I read this book the first time at the age of 13 and 10 years later I love it as much now as i did then. This story is an emotional rollercoaster that will make you hang onto every word. The characters are vibrant, the settings rich, and the tale a timeless one. The ultimate love-hate relationship story.",
            "he falls for a bad woman and thinks that she will turn good for him. But she does not. The latent goodness that he imagines never comes out. He does not mind her bad qualities and in fact admires them. But he does not want them applied to him, at least not all the time. He thinks she can separate them out and give him her good qualities, and just enough badness to make the relationship exciting. It does not work. It works only in romance novels, where the heroine falls for a rotter who is nice to her only while still remaining \"difficult\" but not too much. In this case, where the woman is the bad one (unusual), the author resisted the temptation to give us the happy ending.Rhett likes Scarlett both in spite of and because she is selfish, thoughtless, greedy, a bad mother, shallow, narrowminded, often ignorant and not wanting to learn anything, and lacking in self knowledge. She is also hypocritical, which is actually one of her good qualities. At least she acknowledges that there is something there in the world that is better than her, values superior to hers, characters better than hers, that she should at least pay lip service to. And it's not just lip service. She feels guilt and remorse. She wishes she was better. Let's not be too hard on hypocrisy. It keeps people from worse sins and it protects the innocent.What are her other good qualities? Determination, persistence, courage, shrewdness, resourcefulness, and loyalty to her family, and some notion of decency that keeps her from more seriously bad conduct.Rhett likes her. He finds her fascinating. He sees where she is vulnerable and loves her for that, too. He just wants that she would love him. But for her to do that she has to be a different person. Rhett falls into a classic trap, that the bad person will become good for the one that loves him. Scarlett is too foolish to realize what Rhett offers her, how valuable it is. One problem she has is not wanting to submit. He is willing to submit himself to the loved one, but she is not. She does not want to become dependent on anyone, seeing it as weakness. She is afraid of losing power. He will risk it but she won't.With Ashley, she will be the strong one. So she is not scared of Ashley. With Rhett, he is strong too. And he knows her and can see through her. That scares her. She can't put on airs with him. But Rhett although he teases her does not want to degrade her or change her, except to the extent she will love him. He is willing for her to go her own way. He just wants some honesty from her, so they can be comfortable together and have consensus, so they can get along day to day. He seeks it from the wrong person, however, because Scarlett is not honest about him, herself, or Ashley or Melanie. Rhett fails to see that a person like that cannot be honest with him either.Even at the end when she realizes it has been Rhett all along she still does not get it. She makes a contemptuous remark about Ashley. Rhett corrects her right away. No, he says, Ashley is not contemptible. Rhett is intelligent. He can respect things he does not share in or agree with. He can see the value of Ashley, though they are totally different characters. Scarlett, once she no longer is in love with Ashley, which she never really was, now despises him. She goes in the total opposite direction. That is typical of her and shows a small mind. It also shows that she never knew anything about Ashley. Rhett has a code of honor. Scarlett has no honor.Yet, we like her.If she was just a little more open minded she and Rhett would make a fine pair. If she could see Rhett for what he is, a ruthless harsh man with a code of honor and much kindness in him that he would lavish on her if given a chance. But she does not until it is too late and he has had it with her, with trying to give her love that she never would accept.It's one of the great love stories and the main reason, I believe, the book is still read.The other reason is the description of the old south and the reconstruction era. While I don't agree with all of the author's values, her writing is masterly. She makes you feel what those characters felt. She makes you sympathetic to people with totally different values from your own, which is no mean feat. The reader sees that the characters are wrong about slavery and race and the southern lifestyle, yet feels pity for them. The reader does not root for them to win, yet hopes that things will turn out well for them. When Rhett takes pains to ensure that his child will be accepted by the \"right\" kind of people, the old guard, you feel the same as he does, although you know that it is nonsensical. The old guard will die and it is well that it is so. But you admire Rhett for what he is doing. The book is a testament to the power of good writing, the power of art, the power of a good story. The book is compulsively readable. It is a good example of why we think art is dangerous.The author poured her passion into the book, the passion of the defeated south, and it all comes through on the page. Some parts of the book that go on and on about the south's wounds during reconstruction are tedious as well as historically not factual. For instance, it is not true that the freed slaves had all that power. But when she turns to what the characters feel, she makes you view them with sympathy, even love. The feelings in the book are genuine.",
            "My husband recently bought this copy for me when I showed him the copy I had one my book shelf... The one I have was printed in 1954. It had been read so many times that the spine was missing, pages were loose, some missing, pages stuck together, but I still kept reading it over and over.",
            "what I liked about gone with the wind:Lively description of pre- and post-civil war Southerners, mainly former plantation owners, who were left with no slaves and no money but still not surrendering.Scarlett O'Hara's bold way of overcoming the practical difficulties, even though it was sometimes unpleasant. But overall, to me, it was persuasive.Description of Scarlett's personality was really good and consistent. Thoroughly shallow and thorougly immature. (If there is any doctor or medical student in your family, please go and read about chapter of personality disorders in psychology book. I think Scarlett falls under the category of histrionic personality, as far as I can remember.)Other characters are also well pictured and attractive.Using Belle Watling as contrast to Scarlett, and also Melanie as contrast. Maybe Melanie would have made a better heroine.The end. I guess Scarlett cannot deserve an innocent happy end, but it was good to see that she recognized the truth about Ashley and Rhett at last, ironically via Melanie's death.what I hated about it:Justifying racism, especially KKK. Mitchell's point of view was really disturbing, even after making allowances for her as a pre-war Southerner from heart. OK, Scarlett was the heroine and she might have felt and thought that way pretty much. So Mitchell sticked to it.I agree that the significance of Civil War cannot be reduced to only one point, slavery issue, but Mitchell advocated for plantation owners too much.Rhett made peace with Southerners too easily, while with Bonnie. Also too romantically.Overall, it was good reading, but a little too romantic and inaccurate after all. Good mix of history and romance. If it were for only one of them, it would not have made such a hit. Plus, the force of characters. Mitchell did the best job about characters.",
            "Overall Rating: B+Like all books for which I see a movie adaptation first, I feel as though I was somewhat tainted by the movie. The book is similar though there are some discrepancies in the plot. These details (Scarlett O'Hara's other children by Charles Hamilton and Frank Kennedy, Will Benteen's involvement in Tara, etc) were good deletions from the book for the purposes of the movie production but, like all book to movie transformations, the extra details add an enormous amount of depth to the story.The prose is descriptive but, in parts, not as grand as I expected. Again, perhaps this is the taint from the movie but because the film was so beautifully produced, I expected the same feeling of grandeur from the text.Scarlett O'Hara is an incredibly interesting character; she comes off as a heartless and greedy but also shows an immense amount of passion. She isn't a likable character in most aspects but she does inspire a good amount of admiration for overcoming circumstances well beyond her control. Men play only a passing role for the most part; Rhett Butler is probably the most well developed male character but even he is predictable. Melanie Wilkes is the most pleasant surprise, showing more strength of will than was even broached by the movie. This is most certainly a character driven novel as there are long stretches of time in which very little action happens; on the other hand, there is so much to digest in the last few chapters I felt as though I was always a little behind.There are a few sequels/alternate story lines but, honestly, I'm not interested in the least. I enjoyed the story but it didn't inspire the obsession for me that it has for others.I always try to appreciate the context of language and story when I'm reading story set in another time. That being said, I couldn't help but cringe at the blatant racism displayed in a matter-of-fact way in the story. Racial epithets are frequent throughout the book and the ignorance and idiocy of the slaves/former slaves is taken at a given. This isn't to say it isn't an important part of the book as it was the sentiment of the times but, still, a little hard to listen to at times.I would recommend this to anyone who has a great love of the movie or for those who enjoy long, sweeping epics. In audiobook form, its an enjoyable listen but it is quite a slog.Audiobook Details:The reader, Linda Stephens, had a good balance of accents (she even sings the songs included in the book) and voice depth for the male characters. As much as I enjoyed her reading, the length of the book was so long it would have been refreshing to hear a few other voices. The number of characters in the book is small enough that this would have been an excellent cast production.I didn't recognize any of her other work but I would recommend her as a reader if you enjoy obvious voice acting.Run time was 49 hours, 7 minutes.Published By Recorded Books",
            "This book is wonderful! In history classes we always heard the Civil War from the North's perspective but this book gives us a glimpse into the South's feelings and the changes undergone there. But my favorite part about this book is the descriptions, the plot, the well-developed characters, the language of the times, and especially Scarlett herself. You won't be sorry you read it!",
            "Without a doubt, the best book ever written. I really felt like I was there, no, not even- I felt like I was her. I could understand what she thought, and would say, even if i thought she was a horribly selfish, blind little fool. The only real merits she had was being able to stick to something and get it, and to survive awful things. I was embarrassed for her,I could see the love that Rhett had held out to her, and wished I could tell her before she ruined the lives of everyone around her, not only herself. I felt the love that Melly had for her, and I wished I could be like Melly. The first 5 times I read it,in 7th grade, I cried really hard. Now, in 9th grade, I'm still it's biggest fan. My friends all think I'm obsessed, and maybe I am, but I love this book!!. Alexandra Ripley never should have tried to write a sequel, because it didn't match the facts, or what we knew of the characters. Scarlett may have chased after Rhett, without a doubt that's what she'd do, but she wouldn't go and have affairs with people, and Rhett wouldn't have married Anne. Anyway, what I'm trying to say, is that this is the best book, anyone who hasn't read it is missing out, and anyone who didn't like it is crazy!",
            "This is the best , I live in the south and I get very upset when I hear people say ,oh that book just show's what slavery was all about . That is when you know that, they have not read it. You would have to blind to not know that it's all about a very strong woman. It's wonderfully written .",
            "When I was twelve, I approached Gone with the Wind with reverence because I had repeatedly heard that it was the best novel ever written. A few days later, I closed the book on the last page, and all I felt was letdown. This is perhaps the greatest danger to succumbing to hype.Gone with the Wind is interesting and certainly very readable (I've read it several times since). Scarlett O'Hara is like Becky Sharp, mostly unlikeable, but still admirable for her gutsiness.While reading the book, it began to dawn on me that most of the gush over Gone with the Wind that I'd heard was about the movie rather than the book itself. I went to see the movie. I was appalled; the casting of the four main characters just didn't seem to fit. I already had a fixed notion in my mind of what the characters were like so probably no actors could meet my expectations. If I had read the book or seen the movie without any expectations, possibly I would've liked them better.",
            "Gone With the wind is a beautiful story about love,perseverence, and a woman's determined mind accompanied by an undecided heart, in a story where she learns to grow and fight through hardships, as she matures and prospers during the civil war.",
            "At times the book vvas tedious and i had the urge to skip pages, vvhich i did. i felt that at parts she dragged the story out too much; parts vvhere she used a page or tvvo to describe vvhat the day looked like or vvhat furnishings vvere contained in a room; these vveren't necessary. i like to knovv the setting of the story, but a vvhole page dedicated to descriptions? hmm...Despite this i really enjoyed the story. it offered a different point of vievv of the civil vvar. the pros and cons of slavery. it vvas interesting. i found that i liked the characters: scarlett and rhett..*smiles* they vvere memorable. very endearing characters.It vvas a romance story that rather sticks in my mind. the story vvas about scarlett and her life..yeha it sounds boring and at times it vvas but...read it. you might like it. just give it a try (read the vvhole book) and then decide if u like it or not. but don't read the story if the only reason is because someone or you yourself forced you to read it. u'll probably hate it if u do.Someday vvhen i've forgotten most of the details of the book i might reread it, but for novv i'll go back to my vampire chronicles.enjoy",
            "I agree with many reviewers that the book is an interesting, engrossing novel. The character development and descriptions are very good, and Mitchell does a good job of describing the motives that drive the characters. I also appreciated the fact that Mitchell did not write a typical &quot;happily ever after&quot; ending. However, I find it disturbing that very few reviewers noticed or commented on the extreme racism in the book. If you believe Mitchell's description of the KKK, you would never know that this was a racist, terrorist organization (and still is). Also, according to Mitchell, only &quot;trashy&quot; black people wanted freedom; the &quot;quality&quot; black people wanted to remain slaves!! These are obviously Mitchell's views of black people, and not just the characters' views. Mitchell took pains to write that not all Yankees were bad and that many were ashamed of the corrupt reconstructionist government they had to uphold. In a biography of Mitchell's life, she is described as refusing to attend a class with a black student who has been admitted to her college. I only hope that most readers noted her obviously racist views and realize that slavery was not as she described it.",
            "Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind is the most remembered Civil War love story of our time. The story of Scarlett O' Hara begins on her father's Georgia plantation, Tara. She was raised as a southern woman should be only the War turns her life upside down when she is forced to marry one man after another in order to keep her beloved Tara. Of course none of these men were her true love, which is Ashley Wilkes who is married to a women whom Scarlett cannot stand. Rhett Butler is a man who is disgraced by his family and most of Georgia for his ungentlemanly deeds. Rhett is captivated by Scarlett's strong will and is determined to make her love him. Scarlett has been through death and starvation and only focuses on never letting anything else ruin her already tarnished life. Scarlett's blind love for Ashley prevents Scarlett from seeing Rhett's love for her. In the end, Scarlett finally recognizes whom she truly loves but it might be too late.",
            "at first when i saw how thick GWTW was, I felt like i couldn't finish it. But, by watching the movie, I wanted to read the book. I have nothing bad to say about this book. It's amazing and a person can connect with one of the character immediatly. Scarlett is the one, who is vain, and likes to get her way with everything. Rhett is a great guy... just that his love dies out for Scarlett in the end. the funniest character i consider to be is Mammy. A book that should be in everyone's library.",
            "Scarlett O'Hara is born to an Irish father and Southern belle mother in 1840's Georgia. Pampered all her life, Scarlett pursues the love of Ashley Wilkes, only to be rebuffed. Wounded, she seeks to hurt him by marrying his fiance's brother, Charles Hamilton. When Charles dies in a military camp, Scarlett moves to Atlanta to live with Ashley's wife, Melanie, who doesn't know that Scarlett loves her husband.Rhett Butler, a dashing scoundrel, meets Scarlett for the first time just as she has revealed her love for Ashley. Knowing that a 'true lady' would never have done such a thing, Rhett recognizes the scoundrel in Scarlett and is immediately attracted to her. Throughout his exploits as a blockade runner, he pursues Scarlett while she pines fruitlessly for Ashley.Set against the swirling backdrop of the Civil War, Gone With the Wind is meticulously researched and exceedingly well written. Descriptions of upper class, white, Southern life are fascinating, and the plot is, of course, wildly compelling. Will Ashley leave his wife for Scarlett? Will Rhett reveal his love for Scarlett? Will Scarlett return Rhett's love? How do they survive the great toll the Civil War takes on their lives? A classic page-turner.",
            "\"Gone with the Wind\" - Book ReviewThis is a story of love, of loss, and of courage. Margaret Mitchell created an amazing story, romance saga of love and the most sentimental portrait of the Civil War. \"Gone with the Wind\" in my opinion is deserving of a five-star rating, because it is by far the greatest story ever written. Mitchell's \"Gone with the Wind\" is the story of Scarlett O'Hara, a spoiled southern beautiful woman, whose life is suddenly caught up in the turmoil of the American Civil War. Through her fights during the war and the six years of Reconstruction that follow, author showed her life pass through three husbands and three children. Within this background, we observe Scarlett's conflict against external and internal conflicts, her losses, gains, and hopes. Author described bright vivid characters and relationship between people, but she did not attach great importance to some problem, such as slavery; the book is very interesting and I certainly would recommend it to just about anyone.\"Gone with the Wind\" by Margaret Mitchell is a war novel, a historical romance, a comedy of manners, a bitter lamentation, a cry of the heart, and a long, cold-hearted look at the character of this one lovely woman. It is undoubtedly the classic novel of Civil War. The major characteristic that enables it to achieve its seriousness also criticizes Scarlett O'Hara to a life of unrequited love and dooms her potential for happiness with Rhett Butler. Mitchell created the character, Scarlett, wonderfully. She had spunk, determination, intelligence, and selfishness-traits that made her personality interesting. If Scarlett needs something bad enough, she will not hesitate to throw away proper social conduct or her own personal goals. She does what ever she needs to get her by. Then there is Rhett. He is this attractive man who is no gentleman. He brought a little bit of light into the dark parts of the book. He seems to be just a rude, ill-behaved man at first, but later his character is deep and full of emotion and feelings. Margaret Mitchell created a bond and passion between these two characters. It was a wonderful romance, with love and anger-a sort of bittersweet romance. Although Scarlett is a strong and independent woman, most people can relate to her because she makes mistakes like a normal human. This book examines different types of strength. Whether it is Mammy's honorable courage and dignity, or Rhett's keen level-headedness, or Melanie's Christian devotion to people, each person has his or her own root from which they draw their strength.The perspective is strength because it permits the author to vividly portray the destruction of Southern society better than any battlefield-centered novel could. Unfortunately, it also leaves the author, and therefore Scarlet as well, incapable of understanding the male characters. They are merely personalities that fade in-and-out of the background to shape the narrative. While they are characters that can stand up off the page and cast a shadow, there is no tone or timbre in their images. Some author's descriptions of the reconstruction are degraded. For example, blacks were only happy being slaves. Big Sam says he had enough of freedom and wants to go back to Tara. He even states doubtfully that while in the north whites wanted him to sit at the table like he was their equal, but he could not do it because he is not the equal to whites. At one point Mitchell is describing how the southern whites hate the Yankees so much because the Yankees have money and food and power and they do not, yet she does not have any sense of irony to see that the whites are in the position that they put the slaves in for centuries.If someone loves historical fiction with a little romance, this book is perfect for their. The writing is superb, and the plot is dramatic and sad, but it includes enough of Scarlett's triumphs of strength that sets it apart from all other books. Scarlett O'Hara is the perfect Southern belle who is incredible to read about. How she attracts men with her charm and little helpless acts is unbelievable. She is used to having slaves serve her and she treats them with little or no respect until she needs them. One cannot stop thinking about how much they would hate Scarlet if she was real, but they are not able to stop feeling sorry for her and they want to help her to realize how stupid she is. This is a must read for any person who loves classic literature.\"Gone with the Wind\" is really one of the world's most well written romance novels. Set in the backdrop of the American Civil War in the eighteen century, it tells the story of the people who fought for survival during the War and the Reconstruction Period through sheer shrewd wits and cunning business methods. Margaret Mitchell is an absolute talent. She was nowhere close to the cheap romance writer many had portrayed her to be- she was a realist. She was actually writing about how human spirit and determination, how it can be applied to help one over such obstacles. Mitchell's book broke sales records. Within a year of publication, 1,383,000 copies had been sold. Today, sales stand at over 21,000,000. In 1937 \"Gone with the Wind\" was awarded the Pulitzer Prize.",

Half the time I feel like shaking the chracters and the author for the blind racism that was breathed in like the air. That is why I gave this nook only four stars. Yet I would recommend including it in reading for college age or above as and example of these attitudes but accompanied by works of African American author covering the same historical period.",
            "Epic about the Civil War and Reconstruction and a southern belle named Scarlett O'Hara. She goes through three marriages, children, murder and incredible hardships but pulls through. A lot of people don't know this but it won a Pulitzer Pize for fiction in 1937. Everybody knows about the movie that came out in 1939 and is now a classic.I'm not a fan of romance novels OR historical fiction but I LOVE this book. It shows truthfully (I heard) what the South was like before and after the war. It explains the rites and passages of that era...but never in a boring or leaden manner. Author Margaret Mitchell does it in a matter of fact manner that makes it easily accessible. She makes the characters seem like real people (even though Melanie is a little bit TOO saint-like) and draws you into their troubles and worries. Also I've seen the movie at least nine times and this compares favorably to it. There are some significant changes--Scarlett is 16 in the book, she has THREE children and is desribed as not being pretty (which Vivien Leigh certainly was in the movie), but they're minor. In fact the book helps explain some things that were left out of the movie and clarifies some of the actions of certain characters. But, even on its own, it's a GREAT book. VERY long but never dull. A classic. Pick this one up. Ignore the dreadful sequel \"Scarlett\".",
            "After finishing Margaret Mitchell's first and only novel, the one that landed her a Pulitzer Prize and was adapted into a film that is considered one of the best movies of all time, I felt what was to be expected: completely exhausted. Obviously a book this size cannot be completed in one sitting, and (since I was determined not to rush it) it took me the better part of two weeks to get through it; two weeks to struggle through the American Civil War and its aftermaths, not to mention the tempestuous relationship between four larger-than-life individuals: Melanie Hamilton, Rhett Butler, Ashley Wilkes and the infamous Scarlett O'Hara.Of course, I use the word \"struggle\" in a good way, as this is a book that sucks you up into the trials and tribulations of the time, and spits you out the other side. By its end, I was completely drained, something that no book has left me sinceTess of the D'ubervilles: 2500 Headwords (Oxford Bookworms Library).Scarlett O'Hara is a young Southern belle, one of the most popular debutantes in her community. Although she has power over almost every single young man she knows, one continues to elude her. She has loved Ashley Wilkes since she was fourteen years old, and reacts badly when she hears that he is to be married to Melanie Wilkes - a timid young woman that Scarlett despises.After loosing her temper with Ashley (after her declarations of love to him are not reciprocated, despite an admission that he *does* care for her), she is humiliated to find that their encounter was secretly witnessed by the amoral Captain Rhett Butler, a man with a bad reputation who seems oddly amused at Scarlett's conduct. Furious at both men and incapable of understanding either, Scarlett is barely of aware of the political tensions rising around her.Yet Scarlett is about to be swept up in a conflict far beyond the confines of her heart: the Confederacy and the Yankees have declared war, and her entire world is thrown into chaos. Life is whittled down to its most basic elements: hunger, death, love, birth, morals and - paramount to this particular story - survival. In particular, a question that arises during the story is (particularly in relation to Scarlett), what is survival worth?In creating Scarlett, Mitchell has created one of the most intriguing literary figures of all time. Spoilt, selfish, practical, driven, determined, passionate and often unforgivably short-sighted, Scarlett is an individual whose desire for comfort and security gradually erode away at any sense of right and wrong, her development as a complete individual, and her even personal dignity. Just as Macbeth had his ambition and Othello had his jealously, Scarlett's fatal flaw is her inability to *understand*.She does not understand any of the three most important people in her life (Melanie, Ashley and Rhett), she does not understand her own people or what drives them (she is frustrated at their blind ability to the Cause), and she does not understand the sacrifices that must be made in order for her to find contentment...that is, she does not understand until it is too late.This is character study at its most nuanced, for Scarlett is totally believable and understandable, even when she's doing morally reprehensible things. At the beginning of the novel, her faults are somewhat amusing - the fact that she hates the war mostly because it deprives her of the luxury that she loves, and that she loves Ashley even though she finds him unfathomable.Later though, it takes on a more tragic air, as inner peace continues to elude her and we gradually discover the loneliness that comes with total self-interest. It's beautiful, haunting, heart-rending stuff.However, as it seems with every famous book, there is some controversy and it largely concerns Mitchell's treatment of the pre-war South. Mitchell would love to have us believe that the pre-war South was a golden age of chivalrous landowners that treated their ladies like jewels and their slaves like children. When their society is swept away by the winds of war, we are meant to feel grief, as though a living thing has been snuffed out and its memory slowly dying in the remnants of the people who are left to linger on. Ultimately the book is what it is, and I would certainly still recommend it despite some of its dated and overly-romantic views of the South.I actually watched the movie before reading the novel (it was want wanted me to get hold of the book), and I must say that the two go hand in hand. After reading the book I realized how spot-on the choices in casting the movie were, and it was interesting to see what elements of the book the screenwriters decided to cut; semi-important characters like Will Benteen and Archie, and events like the Yankees raiding Tara and circumstances surrounding Gerald's death. Most surprising in the book was the fact that Scarlett actually had three children, one to each of her husbands. The movie kept only Bonnie, and to be honest, I could understand why this decision was made, considering Wade and Ella have very little to do in the story, and are largely ignored, by the author as well as their mother.Ultimately, the driving force in the book is not the attention to historical detail, the clear and vivid prose, or the weight of grandeur and importance that lies on every page; it is the complex and fascinating relationship between the four major characters: the angelic Melanie, the noble Ashley, the rakish Rhett and the driven Scarlett - and I don't just mean how Scarlett relates to each of them. Just as intriguing is Rhett's admiration and protectiveness toward Melanie, Melanie's blind devotion to Scarlett, and the fact that Rhett and Ashley are uncannily similar in thought, though not deed. The quartet makes up one of the most tangled and intriguing set of relationships ever put to paper, and that alone is worth the time it will take to read \"Gone with the Wind\".",
            "Atlanta, Georgia- No other book has defined the south more than Gone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell. Growing up in the south, I deemed it was time to sit down and read this classic which is in celebrating seventy five years in print.In the 75th Anniversary addition, Pat Conroy write a preface where he chronicles how this book was a bond between he and his mother as she would read it to him and how it profoundly influenced his writings.With over a 900 pages, it is a brick of a book but it does masterfully captures the consequences of what we refer in the south as \"the war of northern aggression\".The principle character Scarlett evolves from a young women ready to be conquered by a wide array of suitors. Her love Ashley has been wooed away and she spends a lifetime trying to pave her way. The allusive Rhett Butler fails to conquer this steel magnolia who always keeps hope alive by reiterating that tomorrow is a new day.Gone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell takes you to the allure of the gentile world of the south.

            "Gone With The Wind gives whoever reads it a very good story but it also teaches you a lot about the Civil War. The story starts at the beginning of the Civil War and it follows the life of Scarlett O'Hara for around 12 years. She is 16 at the beginning of the book.For about ten years of her life she thinks she loves Ashley Wilkes, only to realize that she had never loved Ashely and had tricked herself into thinking she did. At the beginning she tries to get Ashley to marry her instead of his fiance, when he doesn't, she marries Charles Hamilton.Throughout the story she and everyone around her loses everything that was dear to them. Almost everyone lost immediate family members in the war and Scarlett's mother , Ellen died from a fever and her father died after being crazy following Ellen's death. Scarlett struggled for a long time trying to keep her plantation, Tara, together. Scarlett and her family nearly starve for a long time until a man named Will helped them with the farming.Then, Scarlett married her sister's fiance for his money. He died a short while after. The night after his death, Rhett Butler, a man that the town hates because he was a scalawag, asked Scarlett to marry him. After a while she said yes. Within a few years, Scarlett gives birth to a baby girl and Rhett Butler loves her more than anything else. Scarlett loves her, but she never shows it, so Rhett raised Bonnie one his own. Everything is fine until it takes a turn for the worse. Bonnie dies and Melanie Wilkes, Ashley's wife dies. It was then that Scarlett realized how much she loved Melanie and it was then that she finally got her life straightened out.Overall, I think that Gone With The Wind is and excellent book. I would recommend it to highschool students.",
            "What else can be said about this great American epic? The classic coming of age book for many girls here in the South when they turn thirteen, it contains the whole story of the War Between the States amid a compelling love story. You will be glad when you read the book that you don't live in a time when you had to be in mourning for seven years. But, you will miss the era when honor, cause, and respect where such important issues.",
            "Even my husband enjoyed this one! This novel is the perfect combination of romance and action! If you have only seen the movie you haven't gotten the rest of the story! Once you read this one you will be hooked and Scarlett will have to be next! Enjoy!",
            "Gone With The Wind the American classic is a story of love and war in the 1860's. The main character Scarlett O'Hara was a bold women who fought the hardships of the war and also putting up with the man who infuriated her the most Rhett Butler. Rhett Butler was a rich man from Charleston who fell in love with Scarlett during the war. He also had a opinion about everything which Scarlett hated because she was very hot tempered. An incident in the book that made Scarlett my favorite character and also why I like the book so much was when Rhett Butler left her, Mammy and Melanie in the middle of the road when they were going back to Tara from Atlanta.The reason I liked this part so much was she didn't give up and she told Rhett how she felt and how she hated him for doing that. In those days girls really couldn't say their opinions but she did it any ways and showed she was strong . She was very determind to get what she wanted and she did. I really liked this book for many reasons. It gave you a description of how the war really was and it made you realize what they went through when they fought the war. Another reason I liked the book was the characters. Scarlett was a good example because she was a very lively character.Also Rhett Butler he was very good because he was very mysterious and you never knew what he would do next. I would recommend this book to people of all ages. The reason i think this is because it is a great love story and it gives you a understanding of how the war was really . I would defitnetly read this book again.",
            "Me being 11yrs. old didn't think that I would like this book. Boy was I wrong. This is my favorite book of all time! The only thing that I didn't like about the book which I know almost everybody will agree with me on is that it ends so suddenly not even giving you a hint to the outcome. Margaret Mitchell is so good that she can even capture an eleven yr. olds mind with an adult book. This book is easy to put people you know in the characters spots and just sit there all day and daydream a new ending. Did I mention that I loved this book?",
            "If you think you know what this book is about because you've seen the movie then think again. Each time I have read it I discover something new. So many richly complex characters and scenes were left out of the film due to time constraints. It is my favorite book of all time, one of those rare works of literature that you can open up to any page and immediately become engrossed in.",
            "This is the best book of all time it is a love story and a story about survival. Scarlett is both a villain and heroine",
            "This is a great book! I love it. You should read it. It took me one year to finish it.",
            "I never really considered reading this book before and I'd never seen the movie. I'd intended to, see the movie that is, but I'd never even thought about reading the book until a friend had it sitting around and wasn't reading it so I said \"what the heck, what's the drama all about?\".Having the forward done by Pat Conroy certainly helped as he is one of my favorite all time authors, so I dug in. I can't believe I'd never had this book recommend to me before, especially since I'm an outspoken hater of Lincoln (may he and Sherman burn in hell forever). I mean I really hate murderous invaders so hating Lincoln is easy, I never understood how people can make a hero out of both Washington (fighting for self rule) and Lincoln (invading to stop self rule), but I digress.What was really amazing about this book is that Mitchell managed to give a history lesson and wonderful historical flavor without ever actually \"telling\" the reader, she just \"showed\" us and it was wonderful and delightful to read.The is so much rewritten history and people really don't understand much of what they believe or even why they believe it so anyone that thinks they know the about the invasion of the South in the War of 61 and they haven't read this, they are not being honest in what they say they know, they can't be. The way the characters show how life was compared to what we are often taught or simply left to believe because we view things through modern lenses is really an amazing feat and the reason why this is such a good novel.Now to the love and the hate and the clash of personalities and the human nature and on and on, I can't say enough about how great this book is. So much popular modern writing is just trash, or fluff, compared to this depth of characterization, and here's a little clue why: modern writers tend to give us hero's with minor flaws, Scarlet is written very sympathetically, one can't help but love her, and love her deeply in fact, yet she's often wicked, she's certainly totally self absorbed and in modern times we'd probably call her a complete narcissist, BUT we the reader simply can't help but love her.The race relationships in the book are very insightful and give the reader understanding into the culture and mores of the time, and read with a view to the future one can see the root of much of today's racial problems in America, the South was destroyed by the North, the slaves may have been freed in one quick stroke, but they were free for what? The economy was destroyed, enormous wealth was destroyed, and the seeds of resentment and hatred were watered, not just in the hearts of the Southern white upper classes, but in the Northern whites, the poor, the blacks and everyone that suffered huge loss by the actions of state in it's conquest for power.I wish I'd read this book sooner, but now that I have I'll continue to recommend it to any one interested in a great novel of American and Confederate history, and of love, love the universal, the love of family, the love of a woman. Love and hatred, two sides of the same coin and separated by slivers of fate.",
            "I actually read this book. Hard to believe because I'm not used to being bombarded with great detail and historical happenings. Not into it really. But this book was hard to put down. It was slow reading because the detail had me visualizing so much that I had to re-read a lot of passages but when I finally got through it, it was well worth the journey. Highly recommended.",
            "I first read this book when I was in 8th grade. It was for a reading program. I don't remember how long it took me to read it, but I remember thinking it was the greatest book I ever read. I have often tried to convince my friends to read it, but because of its length, they refuse. Let me tell you, the story of Scarlett and Rhett is one of the best out there. It was beautifully written by Mitchell, her descriptions of the characters are extremely vivid as if you are right there in the book with them. I recommend this book for everyone, whether or not this is your type of book. Every page will draw you closer to it and the life it shows. But ever since I have read this book, I've read it at least 3 more times since then. And it always takes me by surprise and pulls me along with it.",
            "As an author with my first novel in its initial release, I am amazed at my recent rereading of GONE WITH THE WIND. I find it hard to believe (though I've known it forever) that GONE WITH THE WIND was Margaret Mitchell's first novel. She pulled it all together here with strong characters, a remarkable plot, and fabulous writing centered around the crucial event in American history. This novel, we all know the story, has become a foundation of American culture. It deserves to be. Read this novel, or read it again, if you haven't for awhile.",
            "When I read Margaret Mitchell's classic &quot;Gone With the Wind,&quot; I was in the eighth grade and as impressionable as a young teen can be. It was my favorite for a long time, and I can still pick it up and reread it without getting bored. A cousin really loves it too, or I thought she did till I learned she loves the movie and had never read the novel. Well! She's read it now, and discovered that not only did Scarlett have other children, she also has ways and feelings you'd never know from the film alone.One example is the maid in the O'Hara household named Mammy. Though she is indeed in the movie, she is a much rounder character in the novel. On her deathbed, Scarlett stays by her side unselfishly, nursing her to the end. Other slave characters are more prominent in the novel also, such as some that move and marry. Vivian Leigh did justice to her role, as did all the others, but still, all pale in comparison to the depths they possess in the book.Screenplays are so different to read than novels that they don't seem to compare either. Sometimes a novel reads so visually that you believe the author had a film version in mind when writing it. One that struck me as such recently was &quot;The Horse Whisperer.&quot;The opening scenes with the girls on horseback, the slow-motion effect of the wreck, all of it, was like watching a movie instead of reading a book. The ability to write this way may be a great talent that most don't possess.What are you thoughts on novels to film? I'd like to know. And, if you've never read your &quot;Gone With the Wind,&quot; try it today and see what you missed in that favorite of yours.",
            "I love books, and I love history. It seems that this book was a godsend for me! Wars have never interested me, the civil war, of course seemed like a no brainer: Yankees=good, Confederates=bad. But this book has made me realize that both sides suffered. It wasn't a no-brainer...it was difficult for everyone. Girls and boys, Women, Men, everyone! So many people suffered, and were hurt. This book is a wonderful mix of adventure, romance and history, weaved together to make one of the best books of all time.",
            "I first read this book, 2 years ago, in 6th grade and loved it. This is one of the best books I'v read, along with Little Women. I love reading books about the past. The caracters were very different from most books. They wern't perfect. I also loved how Scarlett could get any man she wanted ,and did, with the exception of Rhett. It had every thing a good book should have.",
            "I have never had the concentration to sit through the movie all in one go - but I found the book, all 1000+ pages of it, compelling. Other reviewers have commented on the amount of detail put into this book, which makes it all the more real. And we are forced to sympathise and feel for characters that behave in what those of us living in the year 2000 would regard as most sexist and racist behaviour. It really gives you some understanding of how people lived and regarded each other at that time, and the different class and race structures which existed, with interesting insights into the interactions between the people who owned plantations and the slaves who worked on them. And of course, we have the character of Scarlett to contend with - one of the most spoiled and most motivated heroines ever described. I wished so much for her to open her eyes and see what a waste of time Ashley was, and how much Rhett loved her, but she is too immature to realise all this. I am debating whether I should read 'Scarlett', the recently written sequel, or just imagine her living her life out with Suellen and Will, her children and her money. A sign of a great book is the way it stays with you long after you've read it, and I often find myself rethinking passages from this book. I would recommend it for anyone.",
            "I'm a 12 year old and a little while ago finished reading GWTW. It was my favorite movie for the longest time and I decided I wanted to read the book. All my friends bet I would never finish it but I did! It may be long but there was never a dull moment. Read this book or see the movie! Actually, do both!",
            "i am completely in love with the book Gone with the Wind! Mitchell does an amazing job at using such descriptiveness as to put you right there in the story. It kept me up for nights on end as i couldn't get enough of it. This book is full of amazing characters that you grow to love and to hate. My personal favorite, Rhett Butler, made my heart skip a beat every time his name was mentioned. It is an excellent civil war romance that i could read over and over again!",
            "Being a Yankee, I never got why so many white people in the South are STILL so bugged about the Civil War and its aftermath. Well, after reading this book, now I know: those ornery white people down there are descendents of Scarlett O'Hara and Melanie Wilkes (and all those tough old white ladies, the &quot;old cats,&quot; as Scarlett calls them) and by God they just ain't never gonna FORGET! Every American (especially all you Yankees) should read this book for a better understanding of the point of view of rich white Southerners during and after the Civil War. (You still won't think they were RIGHT, by the way, but you'll understand them.) Plus, Scarlett O'Hara is a total piece of work. You've gotta get a load of all the stuff she's up to! This is a chick who could rule the freakin' world!",
            "I remember seeing this film about 40 years ago in Las Vegas. It was showing at the Las Vegas Cinerama next to the old Bonanza Hotel. It took me a couple weeks to read this book, but I really enjoyed it. Mitchell's depiction of the South after Civil War was very accurate as some of my family was from Arkansas and Mississippi so I have some idea of what that mindset was. This is a book that I will probably read i again sometime. I also found that ordering a used book through other dealers via Amazon was very effective and very easy. I will certainly use this service again.",
            "My sister recommended this book to me, saying that \"it was the best book she has ever read\". I knew that this book was amazing, judging from what my family has told me for so long, but I didn't want to read it for one reason that reason being, \"the book is over 1000 pages!!!\" So it's been lying on my shelf for more than a few years until I finally decided to read it. It took me 2 weeks to read (whereas it took my sister 5 days) it and boy, did I have an amazing time reading about Scarlett, her family, Tara, Captain Rhett Butler, Ashley Wilkes, and every body. I especially enjoyed the Southerners points of view about slavery. After readin historical books, all from the Union's point of view, I realized that I've been missing out on a lot of info on the Civil War. I've always thought that Southerners treated their slaves with cruelty, based on what I've read from other histocial fiction books, but after reading this one, I found out that slavery wasn't all about whippings, beatings, and any other kind is mismanagement.Scarlett has to be my favorite character. She is headstrong and stubborn, yes, but she fights for what she believes in and does everything to save Tara, even if it meant hurting family members. This books was dramatic, however, such as whatever someone gained, someone else loses something that is very dear to them but I guess that adds more \"zest\" to the whole story.This is, \"the best book I have ever read in my life\". Well at least in my 14 years of living. If you have the slightest interest in reading this wonderful, enchanting classic, go ahead. I did and I don't regret it.",
            "Wonderful story!! Margaret Mitchell did an amazing job in her research to make this book as accurate as possible. This is one of my favoritr books!",
            "As it always has, GWTW sweeps you up in its story about a woman who faces down adversity and never blinks. Scarlett may have flaws, but when trouble comes, she's the one everyone turns to for answers, and she's the one who has solutions. For many women, especially myself,it's still the most compelling American novel of all time.",
            "I had already read this book, I just reread it because i needed to add it to my kindle. Remains to this day my favorite book!",
            "Absolutely beautiful antique book. Crisp pages, tight binding, and that \"old musty book\" smell well all love. Couldn't be more happy with the service and speed of delivery. Love it!",
            "I remember going to the old Orpheum Theater with my mother and my best friend to see \"Gone With the Wind\" 'in the summer of 1969. I was so excited to see my first grown up film. I can see the maroon curtains unveiling the movie screen as the lights dimmed. Not a sound could be heard, but the opening strains of music and there was Tara! I was smitten. Laura and I sat through the second showing too. Exhausted, but roiled up was I when I got home. On my lonely supper plate laid my very first copy of Margaret Mitchell's GONE WITH THE WIND! Needless to say, I wolfed down supper and went to my room and began reading the book that I've had a love affair with since that summer day.With each reading I notice something I've missed in prior readings. I still find Slavery to be the abomination as it has always been. And it must have been harder to read about a mere 75 years after the end of the Civil War in 1936 when GONE WITH THE WIND was first published. I'm not surprised that this epic historical novel won the Pulitzer Prize in 1937. Mitchell has created a multitude cast of characters, giving each their own distinct voice. The reader can tell the difference between Pork, Mammy, Prissy, and Uncle Peter and that is credit to Mitchell. But even minor characters sound different. Tara, Twelve Oaks, and Atlanta also become fascinating characters too. As Tara represents the ability to change as the new South rises in defeat of its old genteel feudal life style where every man, women, and child are free to live as they want. Twelve Oaks reflects the Old South that is forever torn asunder. It is Ashley's South. He doesn't fit in with the change. He and Melanie are perfect for each other. She understands him and the dream that was the Old South.Rhett Butler hates that Old South because it tossed him out and turned its back on him. His bitterness fuels his pleasure as he sees its demise as Atlanta burns and his pockets are full of Gold. He is the most transformed character in GONE WITH THE WIND. I'd never observed his transformation as I did in this reading. No wonder the 35 year old fell for the fiery self willed 16 year old Scarlett O'Hara. Not only is she spirited, she possess a dogged determination of those who seem to get their way most of the time. It is Scarlett whom Aunt Pitty and Melanie feel safe in the absence of a man in their Atlanta household. It is Scarlett who makes sure her kith and kin are safe, housed, and fed. She tells us that she'll never be hungry again no matter if she has to cheat, steal, or commit murder. So it's no surprise that she marries for convenience after she had married to make Ashley miserable and silence wagging tongues at Twelve Oaks. I felt sorry for her boys; she really was a mother only to her precious Bonnie. And how on Earth could she have loved a wuss like Ashley Wilkes when she had a grown man who loved her? I'd like to think that Scarlett O'Hara Hamilton Kennedy Butler got her man back after she returns to Tara. The land always gives her strength and regenerates her spirits. But I wonder if she realized too late that she loved Rhett and really belonged with him? Well after all, tomorrow is another day.",
            "I bought it for my kindle, because its summer and there will probably never be a better beach read or a better book ever anyway. Scarlett still steals your breath with her personality and Rhett still makes you swoon and this is still the best book I ever read.",
            "When I began this book, I began something that I didn't know how to end. I began a journey, and as this journey came to a close, I nearly came unravelled at the seams. I'm serious. This book is ruining my life a little bit right now, and I'm just not sure what my refractory period is after finishing a truly, devastatingly good novel that also breaks my heart.I will say this as a foreward to a very long and very emotional review- this book is quite problematic for me and I'm sure for many others as well. I am a girl born and raised in the North and there are some things, even fictional things, that I am uncomfortable with. That's just who I am. I absolutely applaud Mitchell on this masterpiece, but I also raise an eyebrow at her. There are offensive things in this book, mind you, and it takes awhile to get past them.We all know the basics of this 1,000 page Bildungsroman. Scarlett O'Hara, sixteen years old, the charming Southern Belle on her plantation Tara, blissfully ignorant and delightfully simple, devoted to her one true love, Ashley Wilkes, while courting several other \"beaux\" and enjoying her sweet life. Then the war comes, and then Ashley marries, then Rhett Butler appears, and suddenly, the novel begins, and I was swept away by its tide so fast I didn't know what hit me.My first reaction to Scarlett was overwhelmingly negative, which I'm sure is the common reaction. She is just so overwhelmingly simple. She cannot grasp scarcasm or irony or metaphor, she hates books, and she detests any talk of politics. And she prefers the chaste and simpering affection of men to any kind of female companionship, save for the love of her precious and doting mother Ellen. And for some unfathomable reason, she is absolutely devoted to Ashley Wilkes, a sappy pretty boy who is already engaged to be married. Scarlett is the protagonist I usually shut the book for. I don't identify with her, nor did I originally want to. She was cute, sure, and I was swept away by her first dance with Rhett, but I still didn't like her. Then, about 200 pages in, she becomes a heroine.I will always consider Scarlett O'Hara one of the bravest women I've ever read. She is strong, she is willful, and she does what needs to be done, no matter how unsuited she is for the job. When she had to help Melanie Wilkes give birth, sweet little Melanie whom Scarlett hated with fire, amidst burning Atlanta, I was on the edge of my seat. When she was abandoned by Rhett and had to fend for herself, Melanie, the baby, and her child, she just fought, and she survived. And I felt like there was hope for the rest of the story.Not only was Scarlett a heroine, she was a clever one. She married her second husband for money and used that money to make more money for herself, while presenting herself in \"unladylike\" ways, such as -gasp- leaving the house while pregnant! Quelle horreur! I loved this part because it wasn't just cheesy romance or adventure, it was relevant and interesting and very smart. Scarlett was blossoming, maybe not to others as much as she as to me. She was beginning to grow so multi-faceted. Now I have this strong, brave, brilliant woman, and what does she do? She breaks my little heart. All because of Rhett Butler.Rhett Butler was a conflicting character for me. To most women, he's a god. He's manly, rough, and a little dirty, but he also tries to know what women want and he loves hard and deep. But he's kind of a jerk and I go back and forth between loving and hating him. He doesn't take Scarlett seriously and he seems to think too highly of her reasoning skills, and I don't think those two ever really knew each other at all. Not to mention the fact that he probably raped her. He does redeem himself at the end, at least he mostly does, and then my heart ached so bad and I wanted things to be different so badly. I felt like I was the one who'd lost my chance. I was the one who didn't get my love, not Scarlett or Rhett. I hurt for them, for the evils they saw, for the harshness they lived, for the children and friends and family they lost. I was brought close to them and then I was torn apart. Mitchell made me love what could have been, and then when it wasn't, it was a loss that I am still recovering from.There are so many characters you fall in love with in this novel. Scarlett is probably one of the most multi-faceted characters I've ever read, and I think I love her. She is cold, powerful, manipulative, spiteful, delusional, childish, and shameless, but she is also hardworking, stubborn, idealistic, charming, hopeful, sensical, practical, and intensely brave. She grows in some ways and stays the same in others. She knows how to get what she wants and she knows how to stand up for herself, but when she learns a lesson, she learns it too late, and I just want to shake her. She is infuriating, but she is also infuriatingly real, and I will never forget her.Melanie is another character I will never forget. Her sheer devotion and faith and loyalty to Scarlett is achingly bittersweet, since she is used like Scarlett's puppet, but the scene of her death killed me. That is the only time Scarlett states her outward affection for Melanie and it was perfect. The bond they had was really interesting. I loved Will Benteen and Aunt Pitty and little Bonnie Butler.Now let me discuss why I am hesitant to discuss this novel with everyone. \"Gone With the Wind\" is unfathomably racist. I don't care if it was set in a time period. I don't care if it was the environment or the social commentary or even if Margaret Mitchell was racist or not, the language and characterization of the black slaves in Georgia is REALLY offensive. Like Alice Walker has said, white people use the altered way of writing a black person's speech to highlight that they truly know better and that it only makes the black characters look silly and uneducated. In novels with British characters, we don't use different spellings or exaggerated syntax. I HATE when white writers do that. It is embarrassing. I don't like it when people say that this novel was telling the story of the \"real south\", because it doesn't matter if it is real or not, it doesn't need to be glamorized. I'm glad Mammy is such a devoted person. I'm glad Pork is so proud of himself. But I hate that it is somehow attached to their status as slaves.Also, I'm pretty sure Rhett raped Scarlett. She ended up melting into him and enjoying his attention, but he would've done it whether she melted or not. I know that and I think Mitchell knew that. It makes it hard to love Rhett, but then again, there isn't an unconflicted character in this novel.Is this book problematic? Oh, yes. I completely understand the criticism and I won't hesitate to criticize it myself. But sometimes, problematic literature is also beautiful, and well-written, and emotional, and touching. This is one of those books. I will never forget this story. I am changed by it. I was reading it last night and when I read the part after Scarlett fell down the stairs and she calls for Melly but Melly can't come because Rhett is crying in her lap, I started crying. I really was crying because it was too much, and this is what the book does to your life when you set out on the journey to read it. Take the journey but pack a lot of provisions, and keep your mind open but sharpened, and let yourself enjoy it while still taking the time to think and reflect.Now, because I just have to- The girl I was before I read \"Gone With the Wind\" is truly gone with the wind.",
            "I read Gone with the Wind many years ago, so it was a pleasure to read it again. I only gave it 4 stars because I almost always wanted to have a \"talk\" with Scarlett. I am so glad she \"grew up\" finally at the end... a little too late, but better late than never. I loved the history that Mitchell sprinkles through the book. I also enjoyed seeing how some things never change. Such a pleasure to read.",
            "\"Burdens are for shoulders strong enough to carry them\"Tara Plantation, near Jonesborough, near Atlanta, GeorgiaKatie \"Scarlett\" O'Hara is the most charming Southern belle, gathering the attention of beaux all over the surrounding areas. But when she learns the man she had been psuedo-courting, Ashley Wilkes, is marrying Melanie Hamilton from Atlanta, his cousin, she schemes to win him back. When he refuses, she immediately marries Charles Hamilton in spite. But Civil War has come to the South, and Scarlett quickly finds herself a widow, stuck in Atlanta, with a child, unable to be the pretty belle she had been a few months prior. Will Scarlett ever get Ashley? What about the strange Rhett Butler character, who is constantly tweaking her? Will Scarlett and her family survive the war?Let me preface my review with this: I don't read a lot of historical fiction or chick lit or romance or anything. My speciality is science fiction, fantasy, and urban fantasy. However, this book absolutely, positively blew me away!At first, I found the novel a bit slow. There were so many characters, and at first, it seemed like nothing happened. But that wasn't to last. Quickly, I became interested in Scarlett's schemes to snatch Ashley away from Melanie, all the while hating her for her bad behavior. By the end of the book, there were points were I was in near tears.Scarlett wasn't my favorite character. She was a rude, bitter, selfish woman. But I completely understood her predicament. To the reader, she was completely honest, despising her first husband's death (and life!), her dislike of children (don't see that much in romance do we!), her dislike of women's poor station (always having to act \"silly\" in front of the menfolk), and taking the reigns of business to make a life of her own. So while I didn't like her, I also didn't hate her. I understood what she was trying to do and found myself rooting for her against the odds. She is a brilliantly written character, so dynamic, multifaceted and full.Melanie Hamilton was probably my favorite character. This might seem odd as she does come off as a Mary Sue--perfect and sweet to everyone, always right, yada, yada--and I hate Mary Sues. But I really never found Melanie a Mary Sue. Scarlett repeatedly downplays Melanie's beauty. Melanie is strong-willed and works diligently, but tires easily (such as when she works at Tara in the cotton fields). Like Scarlett, Melanie was definitely not a 1-D character. She appeared weak on the outside, while maintaining strenght in the face of danger, in the face of childbirth, in the face of hard times. She was a true inspiration to me.Rhett Butler made me so furious, sometimes I wanted to slap him like Scarlett! But other times, he was so charming and debonair, that I wanted to melt in his arms like butter. I loved how forthright he was, how practical and realistic he was, and yet how at times, his passionate nature came through (joining the Confederate army at the end, for example).Side characters, such as Miss Pittypat, Mammy, Dilcey, Pork, Uncle Peter, Mrs. Meade, Belle Watling, and more, jumped out at me. They felt like real people, people influenced by dreams, desires, and feelings. Probably one of the sweetest moments was when Dr. and Mrs. Meade were talking and she mentioned she would rather him be at Belle's than dead. Given what Mrs. Meade had been through, what she held dear, it was particularly poignant.I could go on endlessly about the amazing life lessons and themes and symbols in the book. Quotes about the status of women at the time, about changing with the changing times, about strength of character, about being who you are, and about what is really important in life abound in this book. Most of the ones that really touched me may be found on my profile page, though the whole book is brimming with it.As this deals with the South during the Civil War, there is much talk of slavery; one of the reasons, I believe, it has been so frequently placed on the Banned Books list. Some people believe that it shows slavery in a favorable light, that blacks were/are children that need to be tended by whites. My opinion is this: it shows how many white Southern plantation owners viewed slaves. Not all slave owners were Mr. Simon Legree of Uncle Tom's Cabin. Conversely, not all slave owners are like the O'Hara's. Yes, there are a lot of black stereotypes (Mammy, Prissy, etc.), but this is a snapshot into the past. You can't take this book and try to force modern views of civil rights and racism into it. However, I do believe it makes a brilliant discussion piece: comparing Scarlett and other Southern whites' views of blacks with other accounts (such as Uncle Tom's Cabin or the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn).All in all, this is a brilliant book, made more excellent by the narrator, who deftly interprets the Southern dialect and accents for the listener. I thoroughly enjoyed it and was heart-broken, but inspired, when it ended. I highly recommend, even to those, like me, who aren't big into historical fiction.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*",
            "If you think this is chick lit, think again. Its thousand pages are so insightful a portrait, almost an expos&eacute;, of Cavalier society that I wonder at the book's popularity in the old Confederacy. It also sustains the lovely device of delivering the author's commentary through a pair of reverse-image channels, Ashley Wilkes and Rhett Butler, twins in their perceptions of the South but opposites in appearance and manner. The amazingly shallow Scarlett O'Hara carries on without quite noticing Ashley's and Rhett's joint narrative, flattering the reader's ability to see what she doesn't.Mitchell's portrayal of the races is as offensive as reality, which is saying a lot. Since we would rather that things had not been so and as we try to make them better it's useful having a baseline document like this, even though it can't properly imagine black slavery from the inside.About the last third of this long book changes tone as the author seems unable to maintain the same novelistic approach to Reconstruction as she did to the war. Mitchell's outrage boils over and the prose becomes somewhat expository.One cannot help being impressed by the continuation of that outrage for so many decades past the 1860s and 1870s. It prompts curiosity to learn more. Remember that Abraham Lincoln broke with the Republican Party late in his first term over post-war policy toward the South. As the GOP became the party of the Army (which it remains) it adopted a hard line that Lincoln rejected. Instead, Lincoln chose a southern (but anti-secessionist) Democrat as his running mate in 1864 under a \"National Union Party\" banner.What would it have meant, to blacks and whites, if Lincoln had been able to impose his own post-war policy? (And has any American ever faced decisions as awesome and consequential as did Abraham Lincoln?)Yet for all the book's historical and social interest in the end you can't around its marvelous sequence of set-pieces. Consider: Scarlett the pampered 19-year-old driving a dying mule and buckboard through the night and the following day amid the terrors of war with the lives of Melanie and her new-born constantly in the balance, only to emerge into her childhood world made desolate, her neighbors burnt out of their homes, her mother dead and her father helpless, her sisters ghostly from disease, broken soldiers roaming the land, and nothing to eat anywhere. How many of us can even grasp the idea of famine in an isolated rural area? Goodness gracious!Gone with the Wind leaves many images that will endure.",
            "If you loved the movie, you'll love the book. But be warned, the actual book itself (the hardcover published by Scribner) is shoddily made. The binding is falling apart and the pages are coming loose as I read it. I'm hoping it holds together until I'm finished reading it.",
            "This is a classic-- wonderful on so many levels and if you haven't read it then you owe yourself this treat. As a teen I was engrossed and ended up reading it several times over the years. ** small spoiler** As a younger person I always knew that Rhett came back to Scarlett. Later, when I got older, I was less certain that there was a happy ending for the pair and haven't read it since. But I still give it 5 stars because it is brilliant and beautiful and moving.",
            "I have read Gone with the Wind at least 10 times. Every time it is read, I find something missed previously. And every time I read it, it means something different to me. It has motivated me to read other books about that era of time and so I have learned a lot about the Civil War era and how important and significant it was for our country's history. I don't feel that the main thrust of the book was romance, but as in most lives, romance occurs some time, and the people of this novel also find some romance. Scarlett moves from one phase of life to the next with a realists mind except when it comes to Ashley Wilkes.All in all, it is a long book, but one that you won't forget.",
            "This book is a classic. One that I believe all southern women should read and pass down to their daughters. It is a story of love, loss, and an age in which we could never fully understand. That being said, this version's printing is not the best. On nearly every page, there are words or letters that are not fully printed. The hardcover, binding, and dust cover are in wonderful shape. The packaging and delivery, too, were outstanding. The only drawback I see is the printing not being 100% clear on each page. I think if you are interesting in purchasing a hardcover copy, you may wish to try a different version. I hope this is helpful.",
            "Well, I'm 41 years old and have finally read this classic! I'm so glad I read it! It will definitely go down as one of my favorites ever read. Margaret Mitchell is a genious writer who really made me feel like I was right there in the south with all of the wonderful characters!This book is filled with romance, war, politics, friendship, business dealings, deception and so so much more! Lots of characters that entertwine and so much fun to read!I couldn't put it down! It is a big book, but well worth it!Read it! Read it!",
            "Ageless story giving a digestable history of the the American Civil War, a feeling of what it was like to live at that time and an entrancing love story. Loved this edition too, good paper and easy size to hold for a long book.",
            "I read this book as a tween and loved it. I didn't know enough to be offended by Mitchell's whitewash of slavery. I hated Melanie and Ashley, and I loved Scarlett and Rhett, even though I thought Scarlett was some kind of a moron to have the hots for Ashley. When I became a novelist, I realized that my love/hate experience with the characters demonstrated just how crafty Mitchell had been in creating her characters because by then I'd met a bunch of readers who loved Melanie/Ashley and hated Scarlett/Rhett. Something for everyone? You betcha. And her \"I'll think about that tomorrow\" ending was also a brilliant move, equally satisfying to readers who want Scarlett to get Rhett back and those who don't.",
            "I have read GWTW many times and have always longed for an adequate recording of this book. So, when I saw this book on CD at the library I checked it out. What a disappointment!I was so sure that a company with the stature of Recorded Books would select only the best narrator. This should have been given to Flo Gibson--someone with the vocal and acting chops to really do justice to both the narative and character portrayal.Just because someone can act well, it doesn't necessarily follow that she will be a great reader. This actor does, in all justice a fairly good job with Scarlett. However, her pacing and phrasing during the narrative portions was mediocre at best and GWTW has a lot of narrative. Secondary characters are not treated with much differentiation of vocal dynamics, expression or seemingly thought about character. The phrasing was particularly poor and down right irritating at times. It sounded as if this reader gave no preparation to some passages and sat down with the book to read aloud passages that she was seeing for the first time. I am really suprised that the editiors let this pass into publication.The only reason I gave it two stars is because the reader does an adequate job with Scarlett and seems to get the accent dead on. \"Reading\" this performance was so tedious that I did not finish the book. I certainly would not buy this performance. Read the book instead.",
            "Absolutely fantasic. This book was so good, even though I couldn`t stand Scarlett most of the time. All the different characters were ejoyable to read, and Rhett`s character had so many different layers that I was always trying to figure out just how much he cared for the unworthy Scarlett. READ THIS BOOK.",
            "Only on page 328, but I am already obsessed! I have received little support in reading this novel. In fact, when I tell people I am reading GWTW each person has replied, \"Oh wow. I've never read it but I saw the movie. Such a great love story.\"To be honest I find myself annoyed! I could never imagine a movie that could substitute this book. And, yes, a love story, but just as well a historical narrative of the grueling life during the civil war through the mind of Scarlet. This leaves me to wonder how could a movie encompass the pages and pages of her thoughts? I am almost too afraid to see the movie for fear it will not live up to my expectations.Anywho... Amazing novel thus far. I highly recommend to those age 12+. In fact, my 16 year old, second cousin recommended it! I'm so proud of her!Best,Kim",
            "I wasn't quite sure whether I would enjoy Gone With the Wind. It's a large, forbidding book. But I loved it. Most of you are probably familiar with the basic story: the main character is Scarlett O'Hara, a spoiled southern belle in the time of the Civil War, and her desire to get everything she wants, through any means possible. A huge book, there are many characters in Gone With the Wind. Scarlett manipulates many men, but the ones she really cares about (Ashley, and later, Rhett), she can't. When she gets something she wants, she doesn't want it anymore. Scarlett is always frustrated, and is always making plans for the future. In some ways, this wasn't what interested me most about the book. I loved the setting. I just read A Soldier's Secret (admittedly, in a whole different class of literature), but anyway, that was from the Union perspective of things. In Gone With the Wind, none of the Southern ladies think that there's going to be a war. And when war does break out, they think that they're going to \"lick\" the Yankees in one battle. But the \"Yankees\" thought the same thing: that the Confederacy would be beaten immediately. Instead, we have a long, drawn-out, brutal, four year conflict.The Southern culture described in the book was interesting too. Among rich Georgia plantation-owners, there is a code of conduct, a certain way of behaving. The ladies can't say what they really think, a widow must wear black mourning clothes for years and never have any fun (Scarlett is in this predicament when she's only seventeen), etc. etc. Rhett Butler challenges all these things. He openly admits that he'd work for the North if he got paid more, he doesn't believe that the South will win, and he mocks the patriotic \"brave\" men of Georgia who fight. But at other times, he can be really cruel to Ashley. It was interesting to see how different life was among wealthy people back then.As for the characters, Scarlett is spoiled and used to getting her way, and she's from a slave-owning family, and yet...sometimes you sympathize with her. She genuinely cares about Ashley, she does have feelings, even though she's not very intelligent (though good at flirting with men.) Most of the deeper ideas expressed by some of the other characters go right over her head, and I was really frustrated by that. But my favorite character was probably Rhett. He's not afraid to challenge the system and say what he thinks, and he always seems to pop in the most convenient situations (for him, at least.) Rhett, when he meets Scarlett, makes her begin to challenge the way of life a bit. When he meets her, she's in mourning for a husband she was married to for two months and who she didn't care about. Only seventeen, she is desperate to be able to go to parties again, and he helps her do that. But he's complicated too. Underneath that mask, he's not as smooth. I think the white characters in the book were very well portrayed. Melanie, the wife of Ashley, is also a very sweet and kind woman, though she always misconstrues what Scarlett is thinking. Melanie always believes the best of people (which perhaps is not always wise), but that makes her a lovable character.However, you have to remember that the book was written in the 1920s and 30s, and set in the 1860s. There are plenty of stereotypes about blacks, and some derogatory words for blacks (darkies, the n-word). I find it very hard to believe that some of the slaves turned servants never wanted freedom, independence, or money. You just have to be aware that Mitchell is obviously very biased, and not believe everything she tells you.Gone With the Wind is a timeless classic and I would definitely recommend it to everyone. You can read Becky's excellent review of it here. Gone With the Wind does take some commitment as it is almost 1000 pages long, but it's a rewarding read.You can read all of my reviews at my blog, novareviews.blogspot.com.",
            "Perhaps you've heard of Gone With the Wind. In movie form, this work is quite stunning and fun. In print, it's breathtaking and provides bone-jarring visuals as well as a rich and well-developed story not often encountered.Mitchell's portrait of pre-during-and post Civil War South gives depth and intelligence to the people of the land, while simultaneously giving voice to their faults and well-intentioned geniality of that day and age.Characters like Scarlett, Rhett and Melanie gain personality that the movie does no justice. Although you know Melanie is going to die, when it finally hits, there's a true sadness that this rich personality we've traveled with is now leaving us. And in the end, Rhett still does leave Scarlett, but it's about more than not \"giving a damn\" and we feel sorry more for Rhett in this scene than for Scarlett (although we are glad that she finally gets it!)The characters almost disappoint as well, as they do everything we wish they wouldn't and do not behave as we want our characters to, thwarting their happy ending every step of the way. But Scarlett's real and honest love for Tara surrounds the novel and holds every element of the story together.In the end, there's only sadness upon finishing this novel in that there will never be a sequel by the late Margaret Mitchell, and perhaps even if there were there'd be no duplicating the magic that she created in this true and poignant work.",
            "I bought an original book 1936. I am just a little more then half way through the book. I'm so glad I didn't live back then. I wouldn't have been near the woman Miss Scarlet was. But when I was growing up I didn't appreciate history. That's why I wanted to read Gone With the Wind. Great history lesson. Sad but that was then",
            "Simply this. GWTW is one of the best books I have ever read. Never thought that would be the case, as I assumed it was just a book about romance and that's not mt preferred genre. But here is the unfortunate truth: while I was completely captivated with the book, I loathe the way it ends. It is like the author just got tired of writing it and decided to wrap things up quick with a few bittersweet insights. So, 99.9% of the book is five stars, the rest, being the very end, gets zero stars.",
            "Gone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell is a timeless classic. It is a wonderful tale that keeps you truly enchanted by the life of Scarlett O'Hara. Gone With the Wind takes place before, during, and after the Civil War in Georgia. It starts out at the beloved Tara, but soon finds itself in Atlanta. When Scarlett speaks of everything going on you can't help but feel the emotion she feels.At the beginning of the story, Scarlett wants Ashley as her husband. However, Ashley is to be married to Melanie, his musical and intelligently inclined cousin. Scarlett ends up marrying Melanie's brother, Charles, even though she still loves Ashley. He soon dies in the war and leaves her with a baby boy. After the war, Scarlett marries her sister's fianc&eacute;e to keep the Yankees from getting Tara. He later dies in a Ku Klux Klan raid and leaves Scarlett with a baby girl. A year later, Scarlett marries Rhett Butler and has a baby girl with him. Soon Rhett leaves Scarlett forever because she still loves Ashley and she needs to sort out her life.",
            "I love the movie so much that I just had to read the book. Now after reading the book I feel like the movie does not follow the book as well or as much as I thought it should. I think the book was a beautiful very complex story and I appreciate the language that is used. The time that the quthor used to explain the thoughts of the characters truly showed her love for each one.I enjoyed the highs and the lows of each character and there was no one that I loved or hated through out the book (except ashley) :). In a time where Twilight and Harry Potter are all that people want to talk about I once again appreciated the journey I took reading this book.#TeamRhett",
            "GWTW remains the classical view southerner's have always thought life was before the \"War of Northern Aggression\", as so many call the Civil War. While life in the \"big house\" was opulent for some, it was bought and paid for by the inhumane life of countless slaves. As a southerner who family never owned slaves - we were too poor!, I enjoy the fantasy that is GWTW, but always have a sickening feeling in the pit of my stomach knowing that the life Scarlett lived was nothing like the life of the average farmer's daughter. Just as the \"robber barons\" of the north enjoyed oppulent living from New York to Newport, society can not afford all for some and nothing for the many. By the way, the book is still VERY LONG!",
            "What can you say about a classic except for simply wonderful. The storyline, the characters, the descriptions of the old south. The civil war and it's horrors, the price you pay for decisions you make. Above all an amazing love story. A classic that will play forever.",

            "I've read this book a few times now. I always find something new. It is definitely a fascinating read no matter where you grew up. Margaret Mitchell's take on race relations is thought-provoking. Her characters cling to you years after reading it.",

            "What can i say? The book is better than the movie, but even though one cannot on screen (seeing the movie in any other media except the large movie theater screen will never be the same. For instance, the burning of Atlanta, does not and will never have the feeling and movement, and the right reaction on any other medium. Anyone who has seen this cannot disagree, I hope!Otherwise, I believe all has already been said on this, and I would not think Miss Mitchell would appreciate a review as long as her work which is set apart from all other literature. It IS in a class by itself! Thank you very much, WilesWales",
            "This has been my favorite book since I was a child. The book is so much better than the movie. I encourage anyone who has only seen the movie to make sure they read the book.The story starts out with a young Scarlett. She is a spoiled young woman who has never had to work for a thing in her life. She is different than many girls her age, because she thinks for herself. The setting is one where women were still property and a womans role in life was to be a wife and mother. Women didn't need any more ambition than that.Throughout the story, we watch as war changes Scarlett's life forever. Never does one scene happen in a battle, but you can feel the impact of the war in the various characters during the story. The author, Margaret Mitchell, gives us insight into the personal history of other characters in the book. This helps us to understand their motivations.The Scarlett in the book shows her human side more than the one in the movie. In the book it becomes obvious that Scarlett was doing the best she could to survive a terriable situation the world thrust upon her. In the movie, she seems like just a selfish b****. More than one scene in the book brings tears to my eye when I visualize what Scarlett was going through.",
            "My favorite book of all times. The description of the civil war helped me get a feel for what happened during those terrible times.",
            "It's remarkable to feel humbled by art, and that's what happened when I opened Gone With the Wind. I am humbled to be a reader of something so beautiful and full of intricacies that remind me what makes great literature, and moreover why it is so crucial.",

            "Margaret Mitchell's epic novel &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; defies all ratings. It deserves far more than a mere ten. I read this book when I was 13 years old, and discovered the most unforgettable story with the most vibrant, LIVING characters ever written. To me, Scarlett O'Hara, Rhett Butler, Melanie Wilkes, and all the others are truly real people. The movie &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; is undoubtedly the greatest film ever made, which it could hardly help being with such a story to work from. This book can and should be read by anyone who loves to read, because it is simply too good to miss.",
            "This book is possibly the greatest piece of literature I have ever set my eyes upon. Although it took me about two weeks to read it, I lived through a decade of history and watched as Scarlett O'Hara struggled against and won over every adversity in the midst of the Civil War. I felt as though I were right there watching as the drama played out before me. Never before have I had such a complete and accurate view of history and been fooled so completely into thinking that characters on the page were real people that actually lived. If one does not read this book, then it is a complete loss to him or her for they have passed up the chance to experience, rather than read, a book",

For as long as I could remember, my sister had been talking about this book and how it had altered her opinion on classic literature. So, in fifth grade, i saw the movie, adored it got a hold of the book and read it to the very end. Even now, my parents remark about my &quot;Gone With the Wind Period&quot; when I thought of nothing but GWTW and read everything I could on the subject. I ordered cards, I got the script to the movie, I even read the biographys, letters and pictures of Margaret Mitchell. It's a awsome movie, a brilliant novel, and, to sum things up, probably the most influential book/movie of my childhood, it helped make me into the person I am today.---Cynthia Christina Vanci",
            "I am only twelve years old, and most people my age aren't at all interested in love stories. I am always interested in a good book, and most of my picks are action or mystery. I have read hundreds of books in my life so far, some of them poorly written, some of them average, but many of them incredible. These books have captured my imagination, but Gone With the Wind took my soul. I almost made a new lake out of my tears when Melanie died. And I loved Mammy! She added some of the funniest parts to a book I have ever had the honor to read. I am still wondering how she'll ever get Rhett back after what happened. I haven't read the sequal yet but I intend to do so. In fact, I am trying to order it from Amazon.com as soon as possible. I don't care if dozens of people didn't like the sequal. I HAVE GOT TO KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT IN THE STORY! That's also one of GWTW's strong points. Most people won't read more than the first chapter, but if you decide to go the extra mile (or two) you will find yourself dodging bullets in Sherman's seige of Atlanta. If there is one weakness to it, it's in the movie itself. It followed closely to the story line, but strangely the guys making it forgot about little Wade and Ella, and almost forgot Will entirely. But even worse, they got Mr. O'hara's death completely mixed up. And some of the guys that they got to play the beaux didn't know the first thing about acting. Charles Hamilton may have been an idiot, but surely he wasn't that dumb! Sorry, I'm getting to into the movie (I just finished watching it for the first time today). Still, despite the movie's sad mistakes, Gone With the Wind has swept this twelve year old boy off is feet and into the civil war in Atlanta! This isn't a rental book. This is a buying book",
            "Being raised in the south myself, I feel a kinship to Scarlett O'Hara. Margaret Mitchell's book has keep me captivated since I was a child. GWTW was one of the first book reports I gave in jr. high school. The teacher couldn't believe that someone of my age could have read such a book. Although it took close to a week to read it, GWTW has stayed in my mind and heart in all the years that have followed. No book has made the impression that this one has made on me. I don't believe there is one that could. The first copy of this book I ever got has long since had the ink rubbed from its pages. It was well worth the time that is takes to read it. It is TRULY a classic",
            "I have read this many times, and love it better every time. Rhett Butler was my first love ever, thanks to Margaret Mitchell. I still have a little crush on him. She made the characters so real that I feel like I grew up knowing them as my friends",
            "How do you rate a work of art? By the amount of people who have fallen under its spell? Or by the amount of hours one spends reading it, and then reviewing it? Gone with the wind has already been rated a ten, and its flame has not diminished an iota. I am fifteen, and I have yet to read a book which portrays civil war, and love, as well as Margaret Mitchell does in Gone with the Wind. I am fifteen, and I have yet to love a heroine as much as I love Scarlett O' Hara. Melanie is good, but Scarlett is alive! Her spirit and unflagging determination awakens in all of us the right to survive. We all need reminders of the horrors of war, and of the fact that while mostly the men go off to war, it is the woman who has to stay home and somehow make do with only the bare essentials of life, and hope...........................I recommend everyone to read this book, it is the best!",

            "Margaret Michell's GONE WITH THE WIND is a tragic saga that can never be forgotten once read. Scarlett O'Hara is headstrong, intelligent, bold, and beautiful but she also makes mistakes. She is selfish and lives for the present. Rett Buttler is one man no woman can ever forget. He is the perfect father and lover whom is first consumed wholly with Scarlett and then driven away by her. Scarlett's frivolousness will be turned over and over in your mind. If you want to read a truely absorbing, romantic, historically accurate book let this one be your first choice",
            "Being a freshman in high school, my opinions are not usually taken for notice, however, I challenged myself in reading this book and found myself all the stronger a person for it. It truly gives the Southern point of view like nothing lese described to us Yankees. Amazing!",
            "i thought that this was a great book because it was a trying time in our history, and through that one woman got through everyhting. loosing her mother, father, and almost her land, that her father won, and worked. throgh everything, scarlett got her life back. even though the way she did it was not a great way. but rhett was great to her, and she realized that she really loved him when nothing else could be done. too little too late.",
            "Gone With The Wind can be praised in so many words, so many sentences, so many paragraphs, so many pages, that I could simple sit here in front of my computer all day and night raveing on it's every spender and glory. With every word that i put on the screen would bring an even bigger smile to my face. This is not just a book, no it's not even a legend, it goes so farther than that. The word to describe this masterpeice has not been created because nothing till its puplication could have deserved it. I often find myself tring to react to situations in the manner that I think my beloved romodel would have. I have built dreams around this book! I plan to move to the south and live happily knowing it was the base for such workmanship!! I Love The Book!!",
            "I hesitated in reading Gone With the Wind, thinking it would be boring and long. It is long, but definitely not boring. I loved all of the characters -- each with their distinct personalities, strengths and weaknesses. I couldn't put the book down. The film does not even capture one tenth of the gloriousness of Margaret Mitchell's words.",
            "I loved this book. It couldn't have been better. I think that Alexandra Ripley (who wrote Scarlett:The sequel . . .) was wrong to try and &quot;fix&quot; GWTW. It can't be fixed. She didn't realize that Rhett's and Scarlett's relationship couldn't be fixed. GWTW was perfect, and I think Scarlett was cool even if she was spoiled. She's very pretty in the movie. =)",
            "This is by far the best book I have ever read. It is the epitimy of what a love story should be. My favorite character from the book is of course, Scarlett O'Hara, because of her passion for life and her southern charm. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone.",
            "Gone with the wind is the best and most unbelievable book I've ever read. It has so much going on and the characters are so interesting you are drawn to them and their lives. Despite the fact that the book is over a thousand pages, I was sorry when it was over! It was amazing.",
            "I think this book was a wonderful story and very, very well written. The author did a great job of descibing every detail right down to the size of Scarlett's dress. From the moment Scarlett O'Hara met Rhett Butler to the last page the story was filled with excitement, joy, and sorrow. This is the best book I have ever read and I would reccommend it to everyone",
            "The atory is written through Scarlets eyes . It tells of a spoilled southern Belle's life when the war begins and after it ends. While reading the book you also get a feel for the changes that the south went through. while Scarlet is defenatly a girl with spirt she is also a selfish mule. In Mammy's words &quot;a mule with a hores harness. I would defenatly say that the book is written for anyone with any heart at all.",
            "No matter where I am or what i do, GWTW is the most amazing book I have read since The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Ms Mitchell is an artist painting for us what Tara and Atlanta are like. She sculpts for us the flavors of the characters and has a certain way of stimulating all of your senses at once. You can taste, see, hear, smell, and almost feel the world that has been created. Not many authors successfully pull this off here in this world of TV and Movies where it is all right there for you and you don't actually have to think about it.",
            "This awesome book takes the reader back to the 1800s and the Civil war era. Its main characters include Scarlett O'Hara Hamilton Kennedy Butler, from whose point of view the story is told, the charming and fickle Rhett Butler, Ashley Wilkes, the object of Scarlett's affection, and his wife, Melly. I say, if you read only one book in your life, this should be it!",
            "Margaret Mitchell's characters are very real and life like. Scarlett is never portrayed as perfect. Rather, the change from the young belle of Tara to the poverty-stricken lumber dealer and then to a lady sitting on a mountain of wealth shows her faults. The infamous Captain Rhett Butler always finds Scarlett. As her hatred for him increases, the more the reader sees the love between them that she is blind to. There is so much in the book that the movie doesn't include. I'm glad it is so long, for it brings longer enjoyment.",
            "I started to read the story a month before its realease to the theaters on june 26 (my birhtday)and I just fell in love with scarlett and the story being 15 now.I just finished it 2 days ago and that must be the best book I have ever read I think i'll read it again in the future,I would defenitly recomend it to anyone.",
            "Having seen the movie more times than I can count, I decided to read the book. I can only say that the book was not a disappointment. Scarlett O'Hara is the kind of character that you hate one minute and love the next. I was inspired by her determination to survive, but shocked at the schemes she came up with. While the book may be rather long, you won't be able to put it down once you start it.",
            "GWTW is, by far, the greatest romantic piece of historical literature ever published. It takes into account the psychological drama of an egotistical teenage girl coming of age as her world falls apart. Scarlett is portrayed with many imperfections (just as we all have), but in the end she sees the error of her ways. It is an American classic because of its representation of our societies obssession with self, and I believe everyone can see at least a piece of themselves in her, which is what makes the story so compelling. I read it for the first time at the age of 13, and 12 years later it continues to stand as the greatest novel ever written in my mind. I recommend it to anyone interested in analyzing a seemingly bad character and finding the reason behind their actions.",
            "Gone with the Wind was truly the best novel I have ever read and by far my favorite. Margaret Mitchell described every little detail so one could see it vividly, even if it was only in one's imagination. The characters were very much like real people and that is something not all author's are able to accomplish. The sequel, although it was a good effort, could not compare to the original. I think Gone with the Wind is a novel that everyone should read. If you haven't already read GWTW, then you don't know what you are missing. :-) :-)",
            "This book is incredible in every way! When I read it the first time, I became obsessed and was transported back to that era. I thought about it so much that even now, over 3 years later, when I read any part of it, I feels so familiar, a little like coming home. As large as the novel is, you won't regret a single moment you spend reading it. I recomend Gone with the Wind to anyone, especially anyone who loves to be transported to another time and place!",
            "Every time I read this novel, it makes me stop and think how there could be so few genuinley talented people on this earth, with someone like Ms. Mitchell to set such a fine example. Her ability to make the characters jump out from the pages is astounding. Her description of raw, human emotion move Scarlett from haughty, capricious and naive, to indignant, through livid and past loquaciously melancholy. This novel is unforgettably and extraodinarily real, penetrating, and poignant. And as for the sequel, A.R.'s 'Scarlett', I think it was great. Obviously not as good as the original, but the effort was recognized and well noted. (I hope that doesn't in any way sound patronizing). I recommend both novels to all ages, and regardless of what type of books you usually like to read. Guaranteed, you will love it!",
            "I am thirteen, and have just graduated 7th grade. I have read Gone with the Wind twice in the past year. I do believe it is the best novel I have read or ever will read. The first time I read Gone with the Wind, it took me four days to read. (the complete unabridged version). I did not spend all day reading it because I was in Kyoto, Japan siteseeing. The second time I was in school and had homework and other things to do so it took me a week to read it again. I also have read Scarlett it also was very good, but not as good as the original. If you haven't read it yet give Gone with the Wind a try!",
            "When i was reading this book, i thought about it and its characters day and night. I even dreamt about them! Thats how good it is! While reading it, it seems as if you are transported to that era and the characters are there in front of you. It is an immortal novel and people of all ages will continue enjoying it. Even those like me, who are not Americans will enjoy it because it is a novel for all nations. Every nation passes through a revolution or massive change atleast once in its history which turns the structure of its society upside down as shown in this novel. All the emotions portrayed so beautifully in this novel like love, hate, determination, a will to fight and struggle are universal. Without any doubt, this novel is the best that i've ever read.",
            "This is the first phrase in the book to describe the spoiled Scarlett O' Hara, who was made immoral by Viven Leigh in the movie verison of ' Gone with the Wind' ( 1939 ). The book is 1024 pages, which is long, but the book is so good, you wouldn't even realize how many pages there are, and you'll be asking for more.The story is about a spoiled Southern Belle named Scarlett O' Hara, who lives in Georgia on her family Plantion, and basically lives the life of a southern belle of her time ( mid-1800's ). Scarlett gets anything she wants, all she has to do is bat her eyelashes. But the one man she wants, Ashley Hamiltion, she can't give. No matter how hard she trys, she just can't get him, and to make matters worst. He's marrying the mousy-type Melanie. Scarlett than goes through the rest of the book, trying to get Ashley through revenge and through her love. Along the way, she meets the handsome Rhett Butler, the man who truly wants to be the only one for Scarlett, but knows he never can.If your fan of the movie ( like I am before I read the book ), then you would notice BIG differences between the two. But the book describes each character perfectly, Scarlett is even more interesting to read about. For movie fans, hearing Scarlett's thoughts is even more of a treat. I'll recommend this book to ANYONE.",
            "Margaret Mitchell was born in Atlanta in November 1900. When she was around thirteen, her family, affluent but not wealthy, moved into a big house on Peachtree Street, one of the principal settings for Gone with the Wind, which she began writing in 1926. The Macmillan Company published Gone with the Wind in May 1936; it won the Pulitzer Prize in 1937. The movie, which won ten Academy Awards, premiered in Atlantic City on December 15, 1939.I read the &#65533;Special Commemorative 60th-Anniversary Edition&#65533; (paperback) purchased from Amazon.com in February 2003, which commemorates the film, not the book. The back cover of that edition quotes the Washington Post claiming it&#65533;s &#65533;The greatest love story of our time, the story of Scarlett O&#65533;Hara and Rhett Butler&#65533;.&#65533; I suspect the person who wrote that saw the movie, but did not read the book. If it&#65533;s the love story that interests you, I suggest you buy the video. If you want to understand the origins of the South&#65533;s point of view though, at least the upper middle class Georgian point of view, then read this book.I was raised in Connecticut and have been often perplexed by the notions of some of my Southern white peers, puzzled for example by the intractable bigotry of intelligent people who are unwilling to understand that they ought to know better. Conversely, I&#65533;ve admired the generous, unselfish, seemingly pointless hospitality given me by a Southern adversary, a rival, so incongruent that it smacked of hypocrisy. Having read Gone with the Wind, I&#65533;m less perplexed and puzzled now. These people were bred on deep roots.Margaret Mitchell fashioned her novel from stories about slavery, the Civil War, reconstruction and abolition told by those who had survived those dramatic events. The people who lived through those terrible times, or their children, told those stories. From these tales, Margaret Mitchell painted a broad panorama of a culture in forced transformation: The brutal and reprehensible conduct of the Yankees, the greed of the carpetbaggers, the noble origins of the KKK, and the corruption of the North&#65533;s reconstruction. It is Southern noblesse telling the story of their decline. Margaret Mitchell is their apologist.The paperback version I read has 1024 pages of small type with narrow margins. Mitchell&#65533;s writing is sometimes exciting, but often it&#65533;s tedious. Descriptions tend to be excessive, and dialogue is often more like monologue. This style may have been fashionable fifty years ago, but I&#65533;ll deduct a star for it today.",
            "WOW~ There is barely enough words to describe how great it is, so I say, Thank You Margret Mitchell, for such a wonderful book. To say the least, I've read so much romance that I can literally guess what happens at the end of each novel (and Jane Austen counts) but this one is just fantastic. However I only gave it four stars because of1)how many man Scarlett has married-Charles, Frank, Rhett~2)I cannot give it four and a half starsI must say thought, to those who love this book, steer clear away from the supposed sequel: \"Scarlett: The Sequel to Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind\" or \"Rhett Butler's People\" It is just a horror to see such a great book have such a terrible sequel for an ending.Anyways, for those who have not yet read this book, HAPPY READING!",
            "What can I say? This one is a classic! A very good historical romance set in the south during and after the Civil War. I cannot help but love and hate Scarlett O'Hara, both for her feisty spirit, her stubborn disposition, and her passion for the unobtainable. If you've never read this book, you should.",
            "Yes, the book is racist, but let's cut Mitchell a little slack. She was a person of her place and time. There were no documentaries to compete with \"Birth of a Nation,\" no internet, and entire towns were segregated. Most white people never heard the other side of the story. Who is to say what Mitchell's attitudes would be today? Probably, like most of the country, she would have become much more thoughtful.While it's tough not to cringe at the casual use of the n-word and \"darky\" in the book, it is what Mitchell knew. Even sweet, precious Melanie decried going up north because her son would have to go to school with \"pickaninnies.\" Forgiving her for romanticizing a vile, inhuman system that degraded women of all colors, \"crackers,\" and black men is easy, because she knew little else. There is no excuse for the twits who swoon over the book and ignore inconvenient facts, because they know better (or should).It takes nothing away from the fact that Mitchell was an awesome writer who could bring characters and settings to life like nobody else. She and J. K. Rowling are about the only two writers who can keep me up reading at night when I have to go to work the next day.",
            "When I read the first sentence of \"Gone with the Wind\" I was forever hooked. The description of the glitz and glamour of Southern life, the odd perspective on the civil war, the turbulence of Rhett Butler's and Scarlett O'Hara's stormy relationship,it is all so well-crafted. The only reason why one might hesitate to read the book is, it was written by a Southener and you do have to endure insults hurled upon the \"darkies\". The good \"darkies\" are the ones that decide to stay with their masters, and it is very unrealistic in that sense. Other than that, it is worth reading. Two thumbs way, way up!",
            "I love this book. I could read it over and over again. While it isn't very well written, it has the ability to take you there into the story and forget everything going on around you. It gives you a lot more detail then the movie, and makes you understand the characters more. You can really understand the motivation behind some of their actions.",
            "GWTW is undoubtedly an american classic for more reasons than one - sweeping storyline, strong characters and just the flow of simple lucid narrative prose that keeps you going from page to page with sustained interest (not an easy job if it is 700 pages!). I read it a few times when i was young, just fell in love with the movie and it is part of my library collection as well. I still enjoy the color and splendor and perky dialogue although the book is too long to read again with other reasons too.As i grew i figured out what was missing underneath the sentiments we have for it. There is not one word against racism or intolerance or suffering undergone by others during those times. Yes the south lost it all but times and lives change, some cruelly others more slowly with time - it is a natural order of things to change and intolerant lifestyles definitely have to. Lot of people have a longing for good times gone, but it needs to be laced with feelings for what caused it to happen and does not automatically mean bad times have come. I would think hidden beneath the huge popularity of the book so many years after it was made is partly love for simpler times but a lot of guilt for simplistic and intolerant ways of the past that were hidden by economic prosperity and picture postcard lifestyles.",
            "I have watched the movie a zillion times. So since I liked the movie so much I thought I would read the book too. I was amazed how much better the book was than the movie. It goes into great detail and you get the entire story. And since I live in Georgia I'm learning about my culture. And I also found out that not all folks who owned slaves were cruel to them. Actually some of their owners were good to them. And also I fell in love with all the characters. I hate Scarlett but yet I love her too. She is like me in a lot of ways. We are both selfish and spoiled. And we both let our conscious get the best of us. I recommend this book to everyone. It is amazing. I never read a book before until now. I can never put it down. I have now read 4 times and gets better each time. It's nothing like the movie. It's far better!",
            "Gone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell, is a captivating book about the southern way of life in the 1860s. Scarlett O'Hara, the main character in the book, is a young, outspoken girl for her times who lives on a big plantation, Tara. Gone With the Wind goes through the tough times of the Civil War. Scarlett wants a man that she can't have, Ashley Wilkes. She ends up marrying Ashley's cousin, Charles Hamilton, just to spite Ashley, but Charles died in war two months later. She found out she was pregnant with his child and named him after Charles's troop leader, Wade Hampton Hamilton. Scarlett waited awhile before she married her sister's beau, Frank Kennedy. She had a baby girl with him also, Ella. Frank was killed while attempting to kill the carpetbaggers who attacked Scarlett on the way to the lumber mill that they owned. She immediately married Rhett Butler, a urbane man that everyone loves to hate. She has yet another child with him, Bonnie Blue. I would recommed the book Gone With the Wind to anyone because its a twist of romance and survival.",
            "GWTW is, hands down, the greatest American novel. In my opinion, it is the greatest novel ever written. When I first read GWTW, I couldn't wait to get to the parts about Scarlett and Rhett. Now, though I still love the interplay between them, I read it for the incredible detail to history. Margaret Mitchell grew up sitting on the knees of old confederate soldiers while they reminisced about the war, then took that treasure and masterfully provided a moving account of the war and it's aftermath through the eyes of Scarlett O'Hara. The wonderful thing is that she is able to give this history lesson all wrapped up in the greatest love story of all times! All the characters are memorable - Mammy, Gerald O'Hara, Ashley, Melanie, not to mention the near-perfect man, Rhett Butler! And then there is Scarlett... While many people who have only seen the movie don't like Scarlett, no one who reads the book can help but admire her sheer determination to overcome the tragedy of the war and rebuild her life. At the same time, it is heart wrenching to see her throwing away the love of her true soul mate and ruining her life because of the fears the war sprouted in her. I admire Scarlett on many levels, and think she is the most vivid heroine in literature because of her failings and her strength. If you could capture Scarlett's fire and Melanie's kindness and roll them into one woman, she could rule the world and be adored by all. If you want a book that will grab your heart and capture your emotions, you must read Gone With The Wind!",
            "I have read this book three times and each time it gets better and better. Our book group enjoyed it too.",
            "this book has endured the many years because it is so well written...yes, we all know the story by heart, and have seen the movie (probably SEVERAL times..) but what a great read! truly a 20th century \"romeo and juliet\"!",
            "\"Gone With the Wind\" is about a Southern belle, Scarlett O'Hara, during the Civil War and Reconstruction. Scarlett is a headstrong girl that is different from other girls. She gets married young, then becomes a widow. When death of many of her closest friends and family die, as well as escaping from the Yankees, she changes for the worse. She tries to win the attention of the so-called love of her life, while trying to keep the respect of her neighbors, who think she's scandalous. Will she survive with the ways in which she was brought up?",
            "If you only read one literary novel of the Old South read Gone With The Wind.",
            "This book was very well written and except for a few intense parts and some language, I thought it was an awesome book! Very interesting. It is about a southern belle and how the Civil War changed her life. It is about her determination and how she made it through no matter what. :) :) :) Read it for yourself and see!",
            "Long book, and it hurts your eyes to read it, but it is well worth reading. So often we hear of the north's view of the war, and now we see it through the strong southern belle, Scarlett. Scarlett isn't nice, in fact she's very down to earth and reflects the flaws as well as the compliments women today share. She is spirited and willing to risk it all to never go hungry again, after feeling the poverty and hunger once Sherman swept through. Unlike many southerners, she realized that the past is gone with the Wind and she must break ties with society in order to stay strong, alive, and comfortable.",
            "One of the best books and best movies ever is Gone witht he wind. I have seen the movie lots and decided to read the book and the book is as good as the movie. The book and movie are almost the same butt he movie dosent include some of Scarletts children born before rhett. I loved the way the book is written and it's characters are classics. The only thing is the book is long a little to long at times but still it's a great read.",
            "\"Gone with the Wind\" by Margaret Mitchell is one of my favorite books of all time. Scarlet O'Hara, the foolish southern belle is in love with Ashley Wilkes, a scholar who won't have anything to do with her. To rebel, she marries his fianc&eacute;e' s brother and when the war breaks out, it turns ugly. She is then forced to move to Atlanta to her husband's house. In Atlanta, Georgia during the Civil War things aren't easy. It is hot and sandy. The sticky humidity is horrible to live in yet the feeling of \"home\" is evident everywhere. There are always barbecues and lazy afternoons up till the war. The south is mostly cotton fields, with little factories while the north is full of manufacturing. Things don't look too good for the south when the war breaks out and to make everything worse, the ports are soon closed off. All too soon Scarlet feels the bitterness of war as her childhood friends die for a losing cause. When she finds Atlanta being attacked by General Sherman she must flee for safety and there is nowhere to go.This story is about a girl who has been spoiled her entire life and then must learn to do things on her own. She faces the fact that she can't have everything and that she has to make sacrifices. Her whole life she has been the brat that depends on everyone else so she can't do anything on her own. She is blinded by her own insolence to the truth that nothing is fair. Sweet Melanie, her sister in law is kind to her and is too sweet hearted to see the wrong in anyone; she doesn't see how corrupt Scarlet' s mind is. She is always on Scarlet' s side despite the horrible things that she does. Scandalous Rhett Butler loves Scarlet for her foul heart and chases her throughout the whole book. Rhett has a history for doing unthinkable things to girls. (Unthinkable at the time; refusing to marry a girl he courted, publicly kissing, etc.) Everyone despises him for making a profit off of the war. All proper people support the failing cause and Rhett makes fun of them. He is a businessman, so nothing is personal till he meets Scarlet. As time progresses, Scarlet comes to realize the damage that she has done with her being wicked to everyone. She literally is and was a spoiled brat. Her suffering teaches her a lesson that we all should learn.If you love historical fiction with a little romance, this book is perfect for you. Scarlet is the perfect Southern belle who is incredible to read about. How she attracts men with her charm and little helpless acts is unbelievable. She is used to having slaves serve her and she treats them with little or no respect until she needs them. You cannot stop thinking about how much you would hate Scarlet if she was real, but you can't stop feeling sorry for her and you want to help her to realize how stupid she is.In this book you have a look at how the south was before and after the Civil War. They were still people with feelings, not horrible people who were wicked. You fall in love with the chivalry and way of life. You also realize how wrong slavery was. Even they knew it was wrong, they just couldn't imagine life without the slave labor. I think that the book is written well, you see why people did things and the reasoning behind their actions. I didn't always agree with what Scarlet did, but I knew why she did things. The book is very interesting and I couldn't put it down at all. I certainly would recommend it to just about anyone. I certainly understand the era better now. The book got me interested in other books about the war and now I can see why people felt the way they did. I can see the good and bad in slavery. I feel that lack of education on the issue is what caused such disastrous effects.Emily Norrod",
            "I had seen the movie and while I liked it, I HATED Scarlet. O.k. she's not my new best friend, but I understand her so much more now! And although I knew what was coming, I still cried in certain parts. By the time I closed the book, I thought if Scarlet didn't get Rhett, I would just die! Excellent book! If you haven't read it, pick it up!",

With this classic, you find yourself bonding with Scarlet- hating her for her obstinate obsessions and agreeing with her basic desires. Melonie Hamilton isn't quite as serene as the movie, but she is just as goodie-goodie. Rhett Butler is good. I'm a high school student, and I read Gone with the Wind in the sixth grade. it was fabulous and everyone should be exposed to the all-too human Scarlet O'Hara.",

            "This item I received in prestine condition. It is a rare version of the book in the first place (and antique), so that's very impressive. The shipping time was very fast as well, and there was even a cordial note inside the book thanking me for my purchase and with added information. Very pleased!",
            "I honestly purchased the kindle edition Of this book by mistake, but decided to give it a go. I'm so glad I did! What a wonderful historical drama. The characters created and the setting during the social and political upheaval of the us civil war makes this book a must read for anyone into historical novels true or not.",
            "\"Gone with the Wind\" by Margaret Mitchell is an important work of literature set in the times of the American Civil War. It is a long book, but I read it quickly. Everytime the story started to slow down, something big happened which brought the momentum back.I would like to warn potential readers however that this not a book to read if you want to sit back and have a relaxing read. The book has a story that is very tumultuous and at times sad. This book is one of the most dramatic books I have read.The book follows the life of a 16 year-old girl in Confederate Georgia called Scarlett O'hara. She is attractive both physically and in the manner in which she acts. I had a huge crush on her when I was reading the book. She wants desperately to marry a young man called Ashley Wilkes who is engaged to a nice girl called Melanie.The book has a number of characters that appear in it also. The most noteworthy is Rhett Butler. Rhett Butler is a speculator who becomes a hero in Georgia for bringing supplies and goods to it through the Union blockade. Although people are grateful to him for bringing in supplies and goods, some have issues with his lack of moral convictions. His character is so macho, he is too macho. To me he seemed like a monster. At the beginning of the book Scarlett has a low opinion of him and I thought that was understandable. I'm a guy, so I don't know what exactly women would think of him, but I suspect that some women might be turned on by his predatory nature viewing him as extremely masculine.Although Scarlett is more physically attractive than Melanie, the girl Ashley Wilkes is engaged to, I actually thought that Melanie was more romantic than the mean-spirited Scarlett O'hara. At times I really felt bad for Melanie who wasn't loved enough by Ashley.\"Gone with the Wind\" takes place during the Civil War and fortunately it doesn't romanticize it. The book makes it clear that many soldiers were coming home maimed or crippled. The book shows that the Civil War was a gruesome conflict.From reading about Scarlett O'hara in \"Gone with the Wind\" I feel that I got a real insight into how women like her think. I now know that such women are not entirely noble although they may claim to be.",
            "I purchased Gone with the Wind (paperback) for my wife's 58th birthday because she had finally worn out the copy she has read repeatedly over the years since high school. We meant to replace it for more than a year, and I came up with the idea to surprise her with it, and her birthday was the perfect time. She told me once that while in high school the book was assigned and she just could not get herself through it, but it was a big deal at the local theater and viewing the movie helped her ace the test! Then post graduation she picked up the book and the rest is history. My purchase has made me a hero. My thanks for filling the order quickly and the timely delivering was greatly appreciated.",
            "This book is beautiful. I wanted a nice copy of the book for display after I read it and its perfect. The paper is textured and having the ribbon bookmark is great.This was a great purchase.",
            "Remembering when this book, \"Gone With The Wind\", first came out, my mother told me that my her brother, a doctor from Montreal Canada, who had settled in the USA, had read it all the way through, finding it compulsively readable. Years and years, (and years!), later, on the 50th Anniverary of GWTW, (the movie, I think), TV GUIDE ran two -- or perhaps it was three -- articles on this book / movie phenomenon. One was a general overview of the movie, and comments from surviving leading players. The other two were equally as fascinating: one was written by a White woman, the other, by a Black man.The White woman said that the value she had gotten from this book was that she had learnt from it, to withstand any hardship, no matter how great.The Black man said that he had been SO ashamed to buy this book. As much ashamed as he would have been, had he bought a pornography book! After reading it, he opined that it did NOT focus on the cruelty, pain, and degradation of slavery, but instead on a woman in love with another woman's financee and later, husband. He compared the book to a hypothetical novel set in World War II, wherein a Nazi officer, a guard in a concentration camp, was having a romance with a secretary. The pain and suffering of so many people, all around them, is all but ignored, in this hypothetical book, as all the attention is on the two lovers. Obviously, the Black gentleman who wrote this article for TV Guide did not like GWTW at all....I think it's important to keep BOTH viewpoints in mind. Because both are very accurate, and both speak volumes about the meaning of \"Gone With The Wind\".",
            "I have enjoyed reading Gone with the Wind. I found the book in great shape.",
            "Gone With The Wind is a classic of mid-twentieth century epic fiction. I read it years after being misguided by Ayn Rand and I was stunned when I realized how closely Rand mimicked Mitchell's prose. Perhaps it was simply the writing style of the time. Mitchell and Rand differ, though, and if both writers create characters that are larger than life, Mitchell's are real while Rand's are pure fantasy.Scarlett O'Hara starts off as a prissy, selfish sixteen year old. She's in love with a beautiful wimp and can't stand losing him to a saintly rival. She marries someone else out of spite at her loss just as the Civil War begins. She's soon a widow and her estate is destroyed, her family in ruins. She marries again to a man with a sound business but no business sense. She takes over his lumber enterprise and gets thing done. She's again widowed and marries Rhett Butler, a man who has all her gumption but whose self interest is tempered by empathy for the aspirations and hopes of others.Scarlett is a fascinating character. She has gumption, she gets things done but has no compassion for anyone but herself. Yet she never wastes any time on recriminations when wronged or when she falls victim to someone else's mistakes; she just moves on to the next task. She has a sense of responsibility, in a way she doesn't clearly understand, and that there are things greater than herself. It is the tension between her inner contradictions that hooks the reader into admiration and that brings about our empathy for her.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo",
            "This is one of my most favorite books. Well-written and full of passion and fun. It's intimidating at first due to the length, but you won't want to put it down!",
            "This book is unlike any other that I have encountered thus far. It is a dinamic story of a firey young southern girl forced to come to grips with the realities of the war-torn south. Once you start reading you will not be able to put this book down. The details that Mitchell includes are breathtaking and make you feel as if you are back in the days of the old south. The character of Scarlett O'Hara is inspiring. This book is many stories in one; it is a coming-of-age piece, a love story, a war story, and a historical novel. All of these genres come together to create a captivating work of art.",
            "Gone with the wind is one of those storys that wraps you up into the story waiting to find out what is going to happen next to Scarlett. Yet it is the most to deal on real life issues back in the 1860's and post civil war. Even if it is fictional.",
            "A wonderful fascinating historical novel, an intriguing character study, and yes, of course, a tragic love story - this is one of 20th century masterpieces and a must-read for anyone.And this doesn't mean that the characters of the book are perfect or their actions right - instead the imperfections of Scarlett, Rhett and others are what make the story work. Mitchel makes them so that anyone really can identify with them at some point, making the story very realistic and believable. No they are not perfect and their bad traits are not extolled or forgiven, as some reviewers here might think. Indeed, the events in the story reflect this point. (Why do u think Scarlett is left all alone in the end?) If anyone thinks that giving your daughter Gone with the Wind to read would make her think or behave like Scarlett at her worst they are very, very wrong and they just don't get the main idea of the novel.Its so sad, frustrating, bittersweet and great and i love it. I very much recommend this book.",
            "Gone With the Wind, by Margaret Mitchell, is an amazing book based rural Georgia from the Civil War antebellum to Reconstruction. Scarlett O'Hara begins as a sixteen-year-old belle of the county, but ends up facing perils the kind of which she could never imagine. In the book, love holds Scarlett together, but in the end fails her. Mitchell's style is unique and distinguishable. The moral value of this book is unusually displayed by the contradictions to it made by Scarlett. I loved reading about Scarlett's relationships with her friends and, more interestingly, her enemies. Though it is sometimes difficult to like Scarlett, it is impossible to ever hate Mitchell's messages throughout this amazing epic novel.",
            "I agree with the woman from the UK. This is ridiculous. Slavery was horrible but guess what ? It happened, so I guess what we should conclude from what you are saying is that we should just forget about Hitler and the concentration camps and pretend like it never happened. The world can be a horrible place so while we're here why don't we face the facts and try to learn from history. Besides, history repeats itself. So, back to the book. WOW! This is the best book I've ever read. Reading this book you realize how horrible slavery was but also what hell Southerner's went through during this period. After all nearly one-fourth of the population of the U.S. was wiped out because of the Civil war and it tells about the people who really changed the South, the carpetbaggers! I saw the movie and after having read the book I can't believe some of the powerful scenes they left out. Like when the Union soldiers were going through Tara and almost took Charles' sword. Or when the Calvert girl came to tell everyone she was going to marry. It just goes on and on. Did you know that MM wrote GWTW for her own pleasure and never thought of herself as a good writer. One day a publisher friend from NY dropped by and saw hundreds of sheets of papers in dissaray and asked if he could look at them. MM had refused to let anybody read what she had been writing but said yes to this guy for some reason then felt self-consious almost immediatley after he left and asked for them back the next day. He said he would never give them back and published them.",
            "Gone With The Wind (GWTW abbreviated for those who are hardcore fans) was a tremendously successful novel, earning its well-deserved title as an American literary masterpiece. Spun from the imagination and supposedly blurry, slightly realistic accounts of Margaret Mitchell and her friends (Mitchell said the characters were based on some of her acquiantances, as she grew up listening to Civil War accounts in the South), the novel took America by storm in the 30's. It was the Great Depression, a time that severely hurt the nation's economy. We were then a nation on the brink of war (sounds like our present time, does'nt it ?), World War II being just around the corner. Mitchell had written short novels that are unfortunately unknown to most readers and sold rarely in bookstores, but GWTW was her only great novel, her magnum opus, her legacy. She took it upon herself to write the great American novel, and she managed quite well. The novel deals with the life-altering Civil War, its effects principally on the main characters, a coquettish, strong-willed, male-manipulating survivor Southern belle, Scarlett O'Hara, an equally strong and slick man of ill-gotten means, Rhett Butler, Ashley Wilkes, of whom Scarlett is enamored and who is a reserved, elegant aristocrat and his wife Melanie Hamilton. The barrage of characters, from the Tarleton twins, to the comedic, gossipy Aunt Pittypat, to the slaves, including Mammy. The novel is very long, and of course, in order to truly enjoy the epic scope of the narrative, one must take time to read. A first read this novel in junior high, devouring every page, immersed in the tragedy and the triumphs that Scarlett faced during what must have been the hardest time for Americans in the nineteenth century. Similarily, the movie, in my opinion, related to the Americans of the 30's, having gone through the Depression, looking forward for resurrection and triumph despite all odds. As Scarlett's motto and unforgettable creed went, &quot;Tomorrow is another day.&quot; Themes of hope, nostalgia and unrequited love abound in this masterful story. I hope you read the novel if you have not and then view the film, rather than other way around. I saw the film first, then read the novel. You will find how DIFFERENT the book is from the movie, and how much more grandeur there is in the novel and how much more developed the characters are (i.e. Scarlett is supposed to have had children with her two husbands before her marriage to Butler). It was not difficul to imagine the characters in the novel looking and speaking as the actors did in the film - Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh, etc. But if you read closely, the characters are definately Southern, bourgeois, prudish, scandalous and quite Victorian in manners. Five stars for the great American novel, five stars for Margaret Mitchell. Gone With The Wind has stood the test of time.",
            "Okay. Raise your hands. How many have seen the movie but not read the book? Come on raise em! I thought so. I'm not taking anything away from the film. I love it, one of my favorites, watched it a gazillion times, but I just read the book for the 2nd time, the first time was, well long time ago. Even though I thought I knew the whole story, I realized there was so much more to the characters and the story.This tale of the South begins on the eve of the Civil War, and centers around a Southern belle, Scarlett O'Hara. Scarlett is a young Belle, with many beau. The young men are buzzing around her. She is the daughter of a wealthy plantation owner, she is spoiled,concieted, and shallow. Her sole purpose in life is to look good and catch a worthy husband.She has hope only for one though,Ashley Wilkes, who is bethrothed to Melanie Hamilton. Her whole life changes, as war breaks out, the Yankees are winning, many of her beau are dieing in the war. She is forced to do things,never in her life would she have thought she must. She must nurse the wounded, work her father's plantation, (as most of the slaves have been set free by the Yankees, or have just run off),she must care for her family, and save the faimly home from the Yankees. Even as the war ends, she still must continue to keep \"Tara\" (the family plantation) out of the hands of Carpetbaggers, and Scalliwags.Scarlett at her young and tender age will do whatever it takes to keep from going hungry and tattered like the rest of the southerners. This includes taking up with the likes of one Rhett Butler. Although the rest of Atlanta see's him as a low life friend to the Yankees, Scarlett see him as a means to end.He is rich, and like Scarlett doesnt really care what anyone else thinks. Rhett comes in and out of her life over the next several years always seeming to come to her resue, and they eventually marry, but not, according to Scarlett for love.Throughout the story we see Scarlett getting stronger with every tradgedy that besets her, and there are many. The loss of her parents, 2 husbands, a child, and of course the war. But what we also see is the loss of her youth and and the way of life she was born to have. In their place we see courage and tenacity,a woman who could run her own business (unheard of in those days), a woman who could shoulder anything that might come her way.It takes the death of Melanie for Scarlett to realize, what she already has in her life that is good. But is it too late?As I mentioned in the beginning, there is so much more in the book then you will see in the movie. There is a depth in some of the characters, like Melanie and Gerald O'hara(Scarlett's father), and more light is shed upon the relationship between the planatation owners and the slaves, we understand Scarlett,and her love for the land a little more, and see more to Rhett. There are other characters too, important to the lives of the main characters, Scarlett has two children besides Bonnie, there is a convict that has entered the lives of all, and the realtionship with Mammy is touched on more so than in the movie. Mrs. Mitchell never forgets to give us descriptions of the land,the war, and the people that will stick with you. We also get more of the history of the war and it's ravages on the South, the aftermath, the formation of \"The Klan\", and much more.Although we might disagree with the politics of the story, like how women were thought of, or the treatment of African American as slaves, Mrs. Mitchell paints us a clear vision of how things were. It was an era in American History that is, well, \"Gone With The Wind\"If you have never read this book or seen the movie, I tried only to give a taste of the story. I hope it has wet your appetite, read the book first, you won't be able to put it down.You will get lost in another time and place.If you have only seen the movie, this will fill in the blanks for you, and you can picture the faces and voices of the characters you know.Happy reading........Laurie P.S. There is also a wonderful sequel to the story calledScarlett: The Sequel to Margaret Mitchell's \"Gone With the Wind\", by Alexandra Ripley(see my review for book details)",
            "This is, beyond all doubt, the greatest novel of all time. It has everything: characters that leap off the pages, a thrillling plot, a powerful philosophy, and a universality that extends beyond the events it catalogues. This is an epic of mammoth proportions that tells not only one story but explores a whole way of living. I wept, cried, and laughed reading this book. This is more than a novel, it is a manual for living. This is not because the characters are perfect or even wholly admirable but because through their experiences we have the opportunity of seeing the world through a completely new lens. Add to this the fact that Scarlett and Rhett have one of the most exciting romances of all time and through this novel we literally have the opportunity to relive the passionate struggles of the Civil War. More than being a story about North and South, it is a story about rising out of the ashes of your own destruction and fighting on when all hope is gone. This is truly a novel that everyone should read. It made me a stronger person and taught me that no matter how bad things get, &quot;Tomorrow is another day.&quot;",
            "I still love it! and it is still remains my favorite novel. I read this as a teenager, and now again 30 years later. To me, it is one of those books that makes me sad for people who don't read, who miss out on the profound life altering and enjoyable experience that books can bring.After reading it again, later in life, I see that it was a book that could have been a huge influence to my early thinking. When I was in High School, early 70's, I was the only one of my friends and family who spoke out against racism... and in a time of racial riots, high emotion and tensions. Racism has always been a passionate issue for me...also woman's issues. The unfairness and stupidities, some blatantly obvious to me, and some not so obvious. Some discrimination I was unaware of for years, even though I looked for them, and was super sensitized to them. But we were all so brain washed, right from the cradle. It is still an evolving process of enlightenment, and will be for a long time to come. These issues have been such passionate issues for me... I now believe, after reading it again, that Gone With the Wind, has been one of those books, that did help inspire my thinking in those formative years. Margaret Mitchell was a great and courageous thinker....before her time. Her insights and knowledge on the Civil War in particular, were impressive for a woman of her times. Her thoughts of the motivations and impetuous behind wars, and the tearing down and building up of civilizations, is inspiring and thought provoking.In the character of Scarlet O'Hara, the rebellious, courageous, strong, engaging, not so sweet Southern bell, she wonderfully sheds light on the foolish traditions and conventions of society, particularly for the women in that unique disintegrating society of Southern Gentility. I think, the brilliance in the creation of that character and the story line allows her to get away with a very feminist and enlightened attitude, that I am sure was still very unpopular, but struggling to get free, in the 1920s and 30's.Also the ambiguities of racism, that existed in the North and the South, she subtly weaves in and about her story. All of it led me to wonder what the attitudes were in Margaret Mitchell's day, and what reading materials had shaped her thinking, during her life.To think that it was her first novel is mind boggling to me. Her thoughts and ideas are still timely today and indeed are timeless. I feel we missed out on some great works when she lost confidence in herself and refused to write again, then was killed so young. Maybe she just lost her heart and spirit, fighting to be herself in a hostile world toward women, and became a burnt out blazing star. I think she was someone I could've related to (not saying that I am a burnt out star LOL, maybe a burnt out light bulb LOL) I would have liked to have known her. She was an independent, rebellious spirit, intolerant of stupid ideas, conventions and traditions imposed by society, which only serves to keep certain segments of the population in control, of men and the wealthy.For a Southern Bell to have had such spirit, passion and intelligence, must have been very hard and lonely for Margaret Mitchell, during her lifetime. She was obviously a very thoughtful and well read person. She must have put up a good fight, I am sure, for her day and circumstances, she must have come up against a lot, and must've certainly been a very special person as well as gifted and talented.Through her skillfull and inspired writing, it was like she was actually there, a witness of the times.... maybe when she conceived the idea for the novel, or maybe, as a young child, civil war veterans could still have been alive and telling stories to her personally ... just think ... wow ... A great book, thought provoking, exciting, informative, and just plain good story telling. I could really imagine the feel and taste of the gritty dusty roads, smell the mud from the rain and the horse dung on the streets, I could imagine hunger, what hominy tastes like, what tight stays feel like, what an unwashed man smells like, I could imagine what the countryside, farms and cityscapes were like, the sounds, sights and smells. The whole experience inflamed my imagination and absorbed my mind.My only criticism of the book is that it could have been edited a little better, some areas were repetitive, but really it only adds to the charm of the book. If it was too perfect it would have been too sterile and may have missed some of the innocence of emotion that carried through. I am glad I read it again....Kathy Struewing",
            "This book is very good, and a page turner. Although many people say that the book is racist, and the author must be too, hardly anyone knows the truth about Margaret Mitchell. She started a program to help get African Americans into college, and that before her time, when there was still lots of prejudice going on. Yes it may sound like a sugar-coated world in GWTW, and it sort-of was back then, until the war hit. Also, you have to consider that the book is FICTION, while it is still historical fiction.",
            "When I saw this book on my mom's bookshelf two years ago, I wanted to read it because I thought that that would make me a &quot;grown up&quot;. But reading it was better than that. I was fascinated by the Southern way of life, as I had only heard bad things about the Confederacy in my history class (it was soooo one-sided). It seemed so beautiful, what with the chivalrous gentlemen and their demure ladies. It was a world where Melanie completely belonged, but Scarlett was in the wrong age. I was so frusterated to see how Scarlett had to forfeit friends and society to keep herself alive. It's hard to like her, but it's impossible not to! She's cold, dismissive to her friends, and uses her looks to get her way- but you like her anyway, no matter how much you admire the other characters for their sweetness and chivalry. You like that she's willing to do everything for Ashley, for Gerald, for Tara. And you're upset when Rhett leaves her even though she completely deserved it. She can get things done, and she will, and we like her. For me, the face of the Confederacy will always be the face of Scarlett O'Hara- con artist, tart, hypocrite, and so much more. And yet still, a part of me wishes that I had been a part of that face.",
            "...This great book.... I read it when I was 16 and since then I read it countless times. Every character and all the dialounge I love. Charles declaration of love to Scarlett is sooo cute. GranMa's Fontaine's remincing of the massacre of her family was perfectly done. Mammy's telling of Rhett going out of his mind after Bonnie's death. Scarlett promise to never going hungry again is a complete classic that every Southerner should learn and know by heart. Melanie's giving birth to Beau is so real. NO women that small and narrow should give birth and if she does she should thank God she lived after the birth. Scarlett's telling Melanie to scream and not to be brave sounded like my mother when Mother told my sister to yell all she wanted. My nephew weighed eleven pounds. There is so much I want to say here. I really will never understand the non-reading public. The stories here in this book are so beatiful. Even if the Story is old and long how can persn resist after the first page. Scarlett to me is a real person. So what if she is spoiled brat. At least she knows what she wants. But...her being in love with Ashley is beyond me. He is pathetic. Rhett. Wow!! What a man. Now that is a Man I would love to have for myself. Again I will never under Scarlett here. What was she thinking in letting a fine man like Rhett to get away mooning over a man like Ashley, then realizing too late that she never \"really\" loved him? WELL, I least I hope I know she had to have gotten him back. And, I'm not talking at all about that horrid book \"SCARLETT\" either. I don't need that book to continue the story for me. I like to think I can continue the story in my mind. After all tomorrow is another day.",
            "Margaret Mitchell's requiem of the South succeeds to embrace both the reader and her topic because of the tremendous blend of themes which resound throughout this masterful novel.First, she introduces us to the concept of peace versus war: \"All wars are sacred, to those who have to fight them. If the people who started them did not make wars sacred, who would be foolish enough to fight?\" And, of course business pragmatist Rhett Butler concludes, \"All wars are in realty money squabbles. But so few people ever realize it. Their ears are too full of bugles and drums . . . \" This dialogue of sanctity of war versus business pragmatism constantly resounds in the book.Secondly, is how men treat other men. And, within this theme are numerous subtopics. The most obvious is the North versus the South. \"Arrogance and callousness for the conquerors, bitter endurance and hatred for the conquered.\" When you start a war - know that at the end you still have an enemy, and that enemy's feelings toward you may be stronger and more bitter! The other obvious theme is white versus black. Slavery versus freedom for the \"darkies.\" And, although that serfdom appears to symbiotically exist in the Camelot of the Georgian south, Ashley Wilkes tells Scarlett O'Hara at one time that had there been no war and had his father died with slavery still intact, he would have freed his slaves as his methodically conceived logical conclusion was to do the right thing : free men.Ashley Wilkes, who displays another great theme of old antebellum South's gentlemen in the new world of the Reconstruction South, is both hero and goat. Rhett Butler always tells Scarlett that Ashley's days of importance ended when his environs were burnt to ashes at the war's end. She never agrees, at least until the end. And, while she disagrees with Rhett about Ashley, they gang up on her on yet another masterful man versus man theme: employment of convict labor. Treated worse than slaves, convicts are the backbone to cheap labor after the war. But, for their hard work they are beaten and fed little and paid less. Ashley, in her post-starvation period, will do almost everything to avoid experiencing hunger again - including hiring white northerners to be her conscripted laborers.Thirdly, we learn about truth versus appearance. Rhett and most of the old South depict the wonderment of southern civility - never say a bad thing about anyone, and always show respect and manners to those about you. This applies to many slaves as well. Ashley and his wife, Melanie (Melly), are embodiments of such gentile mannerisms. Scarlett's mother Ellen was another. Scarlett's father, Gerald O'Hara, and Scarlett are not. But, Scarlett and her father were truthful. The Irish in father and daughter refused to fub, they refused to be concerned about the foderol scurried about by gossip - holding such lack of care when the idle gossip festered to outright defamatory lies. Rhett, who loves the lack of deception in Scarlett's character, often criticizes his peers for their hypocrisy. Rhett admits to engaging in the same for purposes of business; but, as a man he refuses to be known as another who says what he does not mean. But, Rhett, as time progresses in the book, succumbs to the gossip and engages in the very hypocrisy he despises.Fourthly, the issue of uneven playing field resounds. Rich versus poor. Slave owner versus slave. Business owner versus convict labor. South versus North. And, hidden within these themes is Mitchell's greatest announcement: feminism. Scarlett who owns businesses after the war, is criticized by all men and societal women for engaging in a man's world. Even with her success, she is snubbed by the hob nob crowd. But, perhaps greatest in this theme is the concept of men having rights which women cannot. Rhett gallivants with the local prostitute Belle without concern, while one emotional hug held by life-long friends and neighbors Scarlett and Ashley is identified as \"adultery.\" When Rhett confronts her about this, Scarlett retaliates, \"You are nothing but a drunken beast who's been with bad women so long that you can't understand anything else but badness. You've lived in dirt too long to know anything else. You are jealous of something you can't understand. Good night.\"Other themes also exist: building versus destroying; growing up versus growing old; Catholics versus Christians; love for family versus love for spouses; raising children versus burying children . . .As these themes ebb and flow and occasionally eddy in this ocean-sized novel, the characters' personalities grow and become embodiments of many stereotypical Southern mainstays. And, to add to the characters, Mitchell uses incredibly detailed phonetic spellings for the crackers' and slaves' dialogues. Her detailed description of people's clothing and household interiors (and exteriors) brand indelible images into the readers' minds. This is writing!Mitchell, whose own life is a mixture of angelic Melly and defiant Scarlett, had three marriages and worked (as a journalist) in a man's world. She knew that her publication would be much more difficult than a man's work - especially one of such largess. But, like Scarlett, she persevered and triumphed. Mitchell's name remains among the most known in the American literary world - not bad for a small girl from Atlanta.So many passages of this book flow with delicate prose that make it an incredibly easy 960-page read. In Pat Conroy's preface, that great southern writer states, \"This is The Illiad with a Southern accent, burning with the humiliation of Reconstruction. . . Gone with the Wind was not just a book, it was an answer, a clenched fist raised to the North, an anthem of defiance. If you could not defeat the Yankees on the battlefield, then by God, one of your women could rise from the ashes of humiliation to write more powerfully than the enemy and all the historians and novelists who sang the praises of the Union.\"",
            "Gone with the Wind is the story of Scarlett O'Hara (and so much more). When the reader meets Scarlett, it is pre-civil war in the South. The reader gets to see plantation life on Tara and in the Country as it really was. Mitchell takes the reader through the Civil War, how life changed for those that didn't go of to war, how life changed for everyone after it, the mentality of those who survived it and how they lived afterwards. The reader gets to watch these character develop and change with the times.Mitchell's character description is amazing! As a reader, you feel transported into this world, as if these characters are your friends, and as if you are a part of this town - just another neighbor. You will feel for each and everyone in some way at some time. You'll not want to put the book down, nor will you want it to end....What can one really say about this book other than it is a great read and one that everyone should pick up!",
            "Many people only know Gone With The Wind through the beautiful 1939 David O. Selznick film. That is a disappointment, as the novel is so much richer and complex than the film could realize.Written in the mid 1930s by a novice writer, it nonethe less manages to evoke the spirit of the Civil War and the passion that is Scarlett O'Hara.While commonly viewed as a war novel, it is actually much more: both a brilliant comedy of manners and the first frankly feminist novel written. Ms. Mitchell manages to make us care about Scarlett, while allowing us also to laugh at her occasionally.Do not be put off by the book's length. While an enormous undertaking, it moves along at a breakneck pace, and is absorbing from the very first page.Some have criticized the book for its racist portrayal of the black characters. While it does seem so from a 21st Century perspective, that can perhaps be forgiven when remembering that it was written by a Southerner in the early 20th Century. In any event, some of the most noble, sympathetic characters of the book are black and slaves.This is a book to enjoy and savor more than once. The 60th Anniversary Edition is especially nice, coming in a slipcover and containing analysis of the book by other authors and literary critics.",
            "If you read the other customer reviews, you will definitely guess that people love this book. They really, really love it.I read this book primarily because it is such a major piece of 20th century American Literature and film and I'm glad I read it. Several friends saw the book on my table and assumed my wife was reading it. I took some teasing over it.I liked it more than I expected to but I couldn't quite get past some of the views expressed or supported. I do think Mitchell goes further than just showing how southerners thought of blacks and actually has sympathy for some of the attitudes.Mitchell writes a lot of good scenes and social situations. Scarlett is quite a character. She is selfish, egotistical, forceful and mean. She's also loyal, smart and has incredible inner strength. To Margaret Mitchell's credit, she wrote an incredibly strong female character who is consistently interesting.For a 1000ish page book, it moves quickly but I really did find it to be way, way too long. A lot of the book simply reinforces the Scarlett character and, for me, she could have left out quite a bit of it without losing much. When you love a book, it can't be too long so I expect your view of the book's length will depend on how much you're enjoying it.If I could have forgotten the attitudes expressed towards slavery then I would have given this a higher rating. I couldn't manage to do it though. There are many books with accurate depictions of slavery and the attitude of whites towards slaves and they are very powerful. I think the character that bothers me the most is Rhett Butler. He is a smart, dashing scoundrel who loves Scarlett and is the only one who really knows her nature. He is also a character who admittedly shot a n----r for getting uppity with a white. I realize it was written in the 1930s and described a violent time but I still had some difficulty with it.The book is loaded with memorable quotes and it is a classic with larger than life characters that people love.So, I expect many readers will continue to love this book and I don't begrudge them that but I just couldn't get past certain things. The 3 star rating is almost an abstention regarding whether I recommend it.",
            "As powerful today as when it came out more than 70 years ago. Criticisms that it glorifies the Confederacy are misguided. While still honoring those who survived incredible hardship and loss, Margaret Mitchell skewers the pretensions of those who blindly believed in \"The Cause.\" Her portrayal of how blacks were treated manages to convey her obvious belief that in many respects some slaves were better people than their masters. A great love story set in the midst of a war that is fought mostly offstage. Her prose is magnificent, creating characters and a world that are unique in American literature. An aside: Hollywood did a magnificent job making a classic movie from such a huge book.",
            "Gone With The Wind is timeless. Though the movie gives an overview of the book, there is so much more that is revealed in the book. It reveals much more about each character; it gives a background about Tara and its acquistion; it gives more insight into the relationships between the characters. The historical era is described so that the reader can understand the southern culture of that time. I have read the book at least 5 times, and each time I get something new from the book.",
            "The book was so much better than the movie. One of my new favorite books, will read over and over.",
            "\"And she heard for the first time, without knowing it, the Rebel yell.\"I read Gone With the Wind years ago but was so happy to revisit it as a book club choice. I was surprised by how many people struck up a conversation about it as I carried it with me when I travelled. Imagine writing something that still instigates conversations and connections among strangers who have only this book in common? Love it or hate it, you can't deny the impact it's had.The first time I read this I was in my early 20's. I fell completely in love with every moment. Over 10 years later I was surprised by how my reactions to the characters changed. I had less tolerance for Scarlett and increased respect for Melanie. I was more affected by the soldiers and less swept up in the romance. I still thought Ashley needed a backbone...Despite those differences, my love for the characters did not change. My favorite characters are those with flaws. I cannot become completely encompassed by perfection but prefer some characteristics I can love and some I can hate. In that, Gone With the Wind is spot on. I hope I find this book in my hand a third time, another 10 years from now.",
            "This classic story is classified as a Historical Fiction, but is a good review of the Civil War and about the early southern people of that century. I only wished I had paid more attention to my History Class as I found the story facinating. This is my third go around in reading Gone With the Wind. This time on my Kindle. It is one of the first books I have for my Kindle Library.",
            "If you've never read GWTW, put it next on your list! Scarlett O'Hara is a true southern belle who was living in a dream world with nothing more to worry her pretty little head than what to wear to the next party. Suddenly she finds herself doing the work formerly done by her slaves, delivering a baby, and having become a widow due to the War between the States. This is a story I have read 7 or 8 times in the past. This time I purchased it in large print for my 93-year old mother who wanted to read it again. I may need that large print myself before long!",
            "I bought this as a Christmas present for my mother. She has loved \"Gone With the Wind\" for decades, and I can remember sitting and watching it with her, when we only had one television. This particular book was nothing like the edition I bought her years ago, but it was lost in a long distance move, and I've never found another one like it. This copy takes it's place admirably.",
            "Definately not what I was expecting! I thought this would be one of those book where the characters fall head over heels in love. The romance was developed much more slowly, but was fitting with the plot.The novel is long, but very well-written. It will take you back to the late 19th century and give you a feel for what it was like to live in that time.I wasn't crazy about the ending, as I wished it would be happier, and left me wishing more had been written. I suppose the real ending was meant to be guessed.If you're looking for a good read and you don't mind if it takes some time, I would highly reccomend this book. Truly a classic!",
            "No, I had never read it. My knowledge of it came from the movie. A dear family member was re-reading it, and when I said I never had, she told me it was a must read. I didn't see why, but on her advice, I bought it and read, cover to cover. It is so much better than just the movie. The history of the South and the changes to life the war brought are incredible. Yes, I agree, it is a must read.",
            "First of all, the book is fantastic! Second of all, I could not ask for it to be in better condition! Even being shipped up to Alaska it came in great time and in great condition. I would recommend this book to everyone!",
            "I have read this book several times and it never dissappoints. The main characters; Scarlett, Rhett, Melanie, Ashley, Mammy along with others to numerous to mention are vivid in the minds eye. You are swept up by the turmoil the South suffered during the Civil War and Reconstruction. Ultimately, it is the love story of all time. A must read!",
            "This book is a true classic. The horrors of the civil war and learning how to live after the defeat and destruction of a culture have been brought to life in a spectacular way. Its unusual in the fact the main character is easy to dislike yet an honest look at flawed human character gains a respect for her. Almost every aspect of the human condition are encountered here within the pages. The movie version while enjoyable lacks the depth of characters and completely omits some characters. Highly recommended!",
            "A classic, I couldn't wait to download this to my Kindle. There is everything you could hope and dream of in this book. Scarlett is so complicated, yet real. My all time favorite book.",
            "The first time I read this Pulitzer winner was when I was in high school. The movie had just been re-released and my best friend and I saw it about 8 times. She still had the best plot description I've ever heard: \"This is the story of Rhett Butler who loves Scarlett O'Hara, who loves Ashley Wilkes, who loves Melanie Hamilton, who loves everyone, including the town tart Belle Watling, who loves Rhett Butler, who loves Scarlett...\"I've since read the book a second and now a third time and recognize more depth than our first summary. Yes, it is still a love story. But it is also a quintessential Southern book, a quintessential great American novel, a quintessential exploration of war and its aftermath, and a quintessential character study of Scarlett O'Hara's evolution from spoiled girl to unstoppable woman.Mitchell has crafted a 1000-page book that reads like a short novel. The characters who people her book present the full spectrum of human traits, from best to worst. These are the qualities that make the book such an enduring favorite, and really a classic work of literature.Is the book without flaws? Of course not. I cringe at the romantic version of the Ku Klux Klan. I am appalled at how often she compares the \"darkies\" to children or, worse yet, apes. But I am still caught up in the story, and that is the reason most people read novels - for a good story. And it was the story that first captured my attention and my heart, and it is the story that still earns it 5 stars.Linda Stephens does a fine job of narrating the audio version, though I thought her Scarlett sounded too mature at the beginning of the book - Scarlett is only 16 when we first meet her, and I thought her voice should have a higher pitch.",
            "This book is amazing!! For a 1,000 page read it just zipped by....the plot was interesting, the characters very well described. I finished the book and watched the movie the same night. Neither one was a disappointment!!",
            "One of my all time favorite books, one I have read several times. A true classic. It brings the South to life.",
            "Love the book I could not but it down - tried to download it on my kindle did not work will try again",
            "Read it first when I was 14 y.o. Still remember how I was bawling that Scarlett couldn't see how wonderful Rhett was and how much he loved her! :)Ah, one of the best books I've ever read!",
            "OMG. How can you review probably the classic of all books ever written? No one has ever duplicated this magnificent book. When I was in high school, I stayed up all night reading it for the first time. I can probably recite it from memory at this point because it required re-reading every couple of years!",
            "This book is a masterpiece of the Antebellem South and its decline and fall during the CivilWar.Its depiction of the character of Scarlett Ohara-its venality, greed and soulessness is a tour-de-force.",
            "Always loved this book ever since I was a teenager. I read this book in just a couple of days. Such a heartbreaking love story.",
            "I'm a big fan of the movie. Decided to rad on kindle (book is big so easier on kindle). So much better than the movie. I did have the movie characters in my head while I was reading, but that just made it do much more real. The movie is great, but the book is just so much better!",
            "Gone With the WindBy Margaret MitchellGone with the Wind was first published in May, 1936, and won the Pulitzer Prize in 1937; the novel linearly chronicles the enchanting and lyrical Old South, the brutal ravages of the Civil War upon the South and the subsequent struggle for reconstruction. Moreover, Gone With the Wind tells the tale of the strong-willed, crafty and determined, Katie \"Scarlett\" O'Hara; one of the most famous female characters in literature (and film - due to the 1939 movie of the same name).The book is a significant read, it was originally published at 1037 pages and now finishes at 1024. But it is well-worth the effort to pour your heart and time into this romantic, courageous and historical novel. If in doubt, consider the fact that it sold $176,000 copies within the first few weeks (at an unprecedented $3 apiece), and has gone on to sell over 30 million copies. Scarlett is considered by many to be the most intriguing female character ever written, and the novel typically tops the \"Most Romantic\" books lists. It took author, Margaret Mitchell, over seven years to write the story and it is the only book she ever published.The story is set in Atlanta, Georgia. Scarlett, the daughter of a wealthy Irish plantation owner, has made up her mind that she is in love with the charming and chivalrous Ashley Wilkes. However, Ashley has committed to marrying his gracious and even-tempered cousin, Melanie Hamilton. Their marriage puts high-minded Scarlett into a lifelong tailspin of ill-fated marriages and emotional conflict. In the meantime, she has the roguish, handsome and financially secure Rhett Butler in the wings for most of the story and eventually marries him but this proves equally tumultuous and ruinous for both of them.This is not a straight-forward love story; rather it is a assortment box of every type of human love imaginable. There is love for one's heritage (the Old South), land (the great Tara Plantation), children (she has four pregnancies), parents (who die), spouses (she has three) lovers, friends, and foes. This is also the story of strength, struggle, and self-realization. It is only at the end of the novel that Scarlett is finally able to distinguish and reconcile the difference between real love and starry-eyed infatuation.The spirited and intrepid Scarlett gives this epic novel wings to soar for over a thousand pages. She is a plucky character who approaches life with the resilience of a determined adventurer. Her intelligent, hard-working, go-getter attitude gives the story backbone, but it is her loves, longings and grievous losses that give it substance. Ultimately, it is her uncompromising ability to fight for herself, and for those she loves, that makes her the heroine of the novel and of the hearts of those who read it.Beth Walz[...]",
            "I loved all the nfo from the book that the movie couldn't give, it was a goo, but long read.",
            "This is just such an enjoyable read. Scarlett is appropriately evil, and in the end redeemable.Wonderful novel. I intend to read this again very soon. I had not realized how much better the book is than the movie!",
            "One of my library students finally finished \"Gone With the Wind.\" She's my voracious reader, whom I allow to check out four, six books at a time. If anyone asks why she gets to check out that many books, she is to say: \"Because I'm special.\" It took her two years to read GWTW: she began it in the sixth grade, let it languish, then this year, as an 8th grader, she started over and read it through. Oh! Yes, she loved it!I first read the 1,037-page novel in the 8th grade as well. That was my first reading. I was severely disappointed with the ending. So I read it again and again, fully expecting each time that Rhett WOULD \"give a damn\" and return to Scarlet. This was not to be, at least, not in the annals of concluded fiction. Who hasn't read GWTW that didn't imagine Rhett returning?Just as in real life, fictional characters also behave according to their dictates (granted, their god is different from those of humans) and their circumstances. Would any self-respecting Rhett return to such a cold-hearted, well, you know how she acts and what she is. Even red-petticoat wearing Mammy scoffed at the idea of Scarlet actually winning either man: book-loving, milquetoast Ashley or hot-blooded, fiercely protective Rhett. One is too tame, the other too untameable.So, what is GWTW really: an historical novel of the South and its Lost Cause or a microscopic look at one woman and how she is both damaged and strenghtned by the War Between the States, which meant nothing more to her than an inconvenience. Is it both?Gone With the Wind, is, of course, both historical and character-driven. Two protagonists, Scarlet and Rhett, are pitted against each other, although both are attracted to each other, whether one knows it or not. Ashley is an unattainable dream, a wish fulfillment; Rhett is a hot rod used to prod Scarlet's sensibilities (which are not so sensible).Of course, the real heroine of the novel is Melanie, sweet, sweet Melanie, symbolic steel magnolia, who can kill an enemy in cold blood, yet defend her most erring sister-in-law. Loyal, devout, faithful, responsible, just keep on naming those lovely positive character attributes and you have Melanie. Does such a woman exist? Of course, she does. You and I both know women like Melanie. They run the churches--behind the scenes unless they're needed up front. Always there, always dependable, yet just a little sicky sweet.Scarlet. To the end, defiant. To the end, hoping for that rescue. To the end, just Scarlett. Oh well, we'll think about it tomorrow. Yes, tomorrow.",
            "A true American classic, Gone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell is a must read for anyone who likes a good story about survival, betrayal, love, and historical fiction. Set in the Old South before, during, and after the Civil War, Scarlett O'Hara must grow up, leave her comfort zone and survive numerous hardships. Although the movie has caught the essence of the book, actually reading this novel is a must for every independent woman in America.",
            "I first read Gone with the Wind when I was in high school. I was 16 and didn't care much about anything, but this book grabbed my attention and held it. I had grown up in an old and established family from the South and had heard all the tales of the horrors of the 'time of our most recent unpleasantness', but Margret Michell's book brought those times to life. Yes, I know what people say about Mitchell and this book, but what was is. You can't change history just because you don't like it. I didn't and don't like a lot of my ancestor's choices, either, but it's there just the same.Anyhow, from the journals I've read (and I've now read lots of them) and my own personal history passed down from word of mouth, I think Ms. Mitchell did a good job of capturing a bygone era. In a word, I'm as captivated by this book in my older years as I was at 16. The book lives.",
            "There are good reasons why Gone With The Wind, published 73 years ago, is a classic among classics, a Pulitzer Prize winner, and has sold over 28 million copies in more than 37 countries. The reasons are that it is an unparalleled monumental epic of the American South that is very rich in historical facts, it has superbly developed unforgettable characters, a narrarative that is so captivating that the reader will feel he/she is right there experiencing all that was going on, and it truly stands the test of time. I enjoyed reading it at least as much now (and possibly more) than when I first read it over 45 years ago. While Gone With The Wind is often marketed as \"the greatest love story of our time,\" it is so much more than that. If you haven't read Gone With The Wind or haven't done so in many years, do yourself a tremendous favor and read it/read it again as soon as possible. It's an experience you'll savor for years to come.",
            "I can understand why Gone with the wind has been considered as a classic. This is Margaret Mitchelle's unforgettable tale of love and hate, gain and lost, life and death, of a nation divided, of the American people being torn apart by the civil war. This is the story of honourable but weak Ashley Wilkes, who lives in his own world, of Melanie Wilkes, who is no less than an angel, of the Fontaines, the Tarletons, the O'Haras and many other Geogians. This is the story of the black and white Southerners before, during, and after the war. Above all, it is the story of Captain Rhett Butler and the beautiful, determined, strong-willed but ignorant and ruthless Scarlett O'Hara.Gone with the wind is an outstanding read!",
            "Five stars is not enough to rate this timeless, flawless epic novel of the South. Miss Mitchell's talent has never been underrated or under-appreciated, but having read it as a teen - then, again recently, after having read \"Rhett Butler's People,\" the authorized sequel to GWTW commissioned by the Mitchell estate, I am newly appreciative of Miss Mitchell's prodigious talent.For those who have only seen the equally terrific, but different, movie, please read Mitchell's original.The movie does stand on its own. I am a fan of novels-turned-books and have seen many. I never denigrate a movie if it differed from the original novel in any way. The two are different media.But Mitchell's only novel earned her a place forever in American literature and is desrving to be read in its entirety.Though long, it is a quick read for the engaged reader.I have not read the much-ballyhooed but often best-seller, unauthorized sequels, but I will do so, mostly out of curiosity.The authorized sequel, Rhett Butler's People, is also interesting, but can never live up to Mitchell's GWTW.",
            "I read this book as a teenager and have absolutely loved it ever since. The descriptive quality of writing that Margaret Mitchell utilizes brings the story and its characters to life. It gives an good glimpse of the state of affairs in the antebellum and postbellum South.I've read this on several occasions, and each time I get just as much enjoyment as I did the first! Excellent!",
            "Gone with the Wind is one of the rare stories that delivers exactly what you wouldn't expect. Nothing about it is predictable, nothing is cliche. The heroine is infintely less of a heroine than ever before - she's Scarlett, the spoiled, selfish Southern daughter of a plantation owner, used to having everything handed to her on a silver platter. During the period of the Civil War, she is forced to grow up and become a woman, but she never loses childish inclinations to selfishness and pettiness.Enter Rhett Butler, the conceited, vulgar 'Yankee' whom Scarlett despises and yet, is fascinated by. Though he is not quite a hero as Scarlett is not a heroine, he has become one of America's most beloved leading men.Gone with the Wind is startling in its storyline and realism, and does not gloss over the brutality and harsh outcomings of the Civil War - on both sides.I purchased my copy of Gone with the Wind at a library. The book had not been used by the library, but donated and then put for sale. I paid $3 for it - in very good condition. It was a 40th Anniversary Edition complete with slipcase. It is positively beautiful, and I could not have gotten a better bargain. Aside from some mild use and wear, and a name written in pencil on the first page, its in perfect condition. An excellent copy - I read it over and over.",
            "Love in the time of war! You can't beat it. The first time I read this book I was interested in the love story. When I read it again, I was mesmerized with the portrait of a time and place which have been erased from our collection memory by layers of political correctness. This paperback edition is lovely, by the way, and it doesn't break apart the way some big paperbacks can.",
            "Gone With the Wind is a classic novel of love and loss. Taking place in a time and place which is, quite literally, &quot;gone with the wind,&quot; it is interesting in both a historical sense and a romantic one. This novel is often called &quot;the greatest love story of all time,&quot; and truthfully at that. There is nothing quite as stirring as the interactions between Rhett and Scarlett. Margaret Mitchell's classic writing and understanding of times gone by makes this one of my (and the world's) ultimate favorites. At this point, this novel has reached so much fame that it is hardly necessary to discuss the plot, but for those uninformed out there, here it is:Scarlett O'Hara is the beautiful and headstrong eldest daughter of rich, high class plantation owners living just south of Atlanta during the antebellum period. Scarlett is the belle of the county - she has the smallest waist, the prettiest face, and the flirtiest personality. She could have any man, except the one she wants - Ashley Wilkes, who is already engaged to the frail but very sweet Melanie. When the Civil War breaks out everything changes. Scarlett marries, but is immediatly made a widow, and she moves to Atlanta to stay with Melanie. All the while Rhett Butler is lurking around. He's handsome, suave, and has a horrible reputation - hardly the kind of gentleman Scarlett was raised to like. But Scarlett, with her stubborn, headstrong attitude, brains, and independence is hardly a typical southern lady. As the war rages on, Scarlett's world is shattered and challenged. Wealth turns to poverty, pride to despair, admiration to dislike, and hate to love.Once started, this is a novel that cannot be put down. Many people read the whole thing (over 1,000 pages) in one very long sitting! That's what I did.",
            "I may just may be a 12-year-old girl, but when I read this book, I fell completely in love with it. I have the movie, an anthology and a paperback version that needs to be replaced after I find a hardcover version in stores. In a way it was better than the movie. It gave you a different idea about what Scarlett O'Hara was like and what she went through. It was and is just an excelent example of American history.",
            "I recieved Gone With the Wind as a Christmas gift and was not very excited about it. I had seen the movie and did not care for it, so I thought the book would problably be even worse--dragging on and on. I was so wrong. While not a quick read by any means, Gone With the Wind is completely fasinating. Everything about this book is perfect, from the characters to the events of the Civil War. Every character, especially the main characters, but even the minor characters, were wonderfully developed and real. I fell in love with each one. Scarlett and Rhett were written so honestly that, even in their wicked times, I could not help but love them. Melanie and Ashely as well were beautifully crafted. The story line is full of intimate, captivating details. Every scene is vital to the feel of the story and the final outcome. It has been several weeks since I finshed Gone With the Wind and I still find myself thinking about it and reliving it in my mind. There is a warning, however: When reading this book, do not read it from the the perspective of a person living in the 21st century. You must remember that our values have changed and, while definately for the better, the culture of Gone With the Wind should be judged on the basis of their own culture and morality, not our own. With that in mind, settle down for one of the most beautifully written and imaginatively creative books of our time.",
            "This book is just amazing. It is mind blowing. I loved it, I never wanted it to end. When I finally pulled myself away to eat or something I was dazed. I felt as though I were wearing glorious, beautiful dresses and corsets. The ending left me heartbroken. As fantastic and brilliant as this novel is, I both loved and hated the ending. It wasn't right as Scarlett and Rhett were made for eachother. So I read the sequal and although it could never match Maragret Mitchell, I was delighted to see Rhett and Scarlett together. It was though it had finally ended as I was far to curious and left hanging to leave it at the ending in Gone With The Wind. It is truly a masterpiece and I wish that Margaret had written the sequal, not alexandra and Margaret Mitchell was the only one who could really make the characters come alive as she did. I am only 15 but this novel makes the gentle, romantic days on the old South so appealing that I wish I knew what it was like to be there! For those who didn't like the sequal I find it hard to think that you didn't like the ending. It was just so hard to leave it with Rhett and Scarlett apart - him not loving her. Read Gone With the Wind than read the sequal Scarlett. Although Scarlett isn't great, it leaves you feeling pleased that they are together!",
            "I've read this book over and over again, and every time I finish I'm convinced that I'm never going to get tired of it. The story, although goes on forever (which think is okay, since I like to read, but many people I know complain abouth the lenght of the book) is so engrossing, so minutely descriptive and fascinating, even people who don't care for this kind of work will have at least to recognize the painstaking job of researching and piecing together the facts about American Southern life in the years of the Civil War. And the characters are something else. My absolute favorite literary heroine is Scarlett O'Hara, even if she was so stupid sometimes she made me desperate, and Rhett... well, sometimes I almost felt sorry for him, for all his macho-man behavior. Almost. You can't really feel sorry for a guy like this. And I loved the ending too, it was just right for the story. Anyway, I highly recommend this book to anyone, it deserves its reputation as a great classic, and by the way, so does the movie, even if it's not quite like the book, but that's to be expected, I guess.",
            "I have read Gone with the Wind in Chinese two times. I think that it is one of the best novels in the world. I was not only enjoying the beautiful language, but also learned the Civil War history. Magaret's characters showed me vivid and alive image. Especially Scarlett O'hara. Maybe, at the beginning of the book is not very interesting. But please continue you will find that you can not give it up. I love to talk about my feelings each time when I read it now. The first time I read it was in 1984. That time, I was a high school student, and reading famous novels was a popular thing to do. When my classmate and I met after summer vacation, they often asked me if I had read something interesting. I picked up Gone with the Wind. It is a huge novel, and there are too many foreigners. I couldn't remember all of the characters names. I couldn't figure out what happened. The only thing I could tell was that Scarlett was a very young girl and she loved to get the boys' attention. I just read one third of it because I was not interested in the love story. The second time that I read it was in 1991. I worked in a bank. My job was to count money. It was so boring when we had no money to count. So, I picked up the novel again. This time I could not give it up. Scarlett absorbed me. She was a spoiled, ruthless girl. She did everything she wanted to do and never thought about the consequences. I could see this from her first marriage. She didn't know if she really loved her husband. She already became Charles' widow and a boy's mother. During the civil war, Scarlett grew up. She had a very strong head. She was a brave lady. She saved her home from Sherman and the carpetbaggers. I think Scarlett was still too young to understand true love. Captain Butler said, &quot;I loved you but I couldn't let you know it. You're so brutal to those who love you, Scarlet. You take their love and hold it over their heads like a whip.&quot; When she recognized that she loved him so much too, it was already too late. Butler didn't trust her any more and didn't want to save his love with her. He left home. I cried for Scarlett. It was painful because their love story does not have a good end. But just because this end, Magaret moved thousands and thousands reader's hearts. I felt sadder than Scarlett did. I wouldn't know how to live without Butler's love. &quot;I'll think of it all tomorrow. After all, tomorrow is another day.&quot; Said Scarlett. That was Scarlett's way. I have learned a lot from her. I become brave and have a strong head after I read it. I can say Gone with the Wind is one of the best novels. It helps me have an excellent marriage. I think that young girls should read it and to learn be a brave and independent person. Finding true love and treating it as treasure is the effective method to have happy marriage.",
            "Scarlett is a complex woman...full of so many emotions that there is some of all of us in her. This book sets the plight of the Old South in an interesting fictional story...educating you without the feel of a textbook. You understand why the South tried like mad to hold onto its clearly outdated values and traditions. The struggle of the South becomes Scarlett's struggle with herself and the changing world around her. Then when you add Rhett Butler into the mix, off go the fireworks! This is truly a book that you have to read to appreciate. I don't enjoy romance novels or fiction that is too fluffy and this book has sometimes had those reputations. Not so...this book will grab you and never let you go.",
            "My mother is a huge fan of Gone With The Wind and for years she tried to get me to read it but I wouldn't because it's not the kind of thing I usually read. However, I finally read it when I was about 15 and I couldn't believe what I had been missing out on! Since then I have read it about a million times! The thing that makes Gone With the Wind so much better than your average romance is the wonderfully realistic characters. Considering she is the heroine Scarlett is not the nicest person in the world but that is what makes her so likeable! The same applies to Rhett Butler, who you can't help falling in love with even though he's not real! The book is sad, exciting and informative all at once and I can honestly say it is the best book I have ever read!!! The sequel &quot;Scarlett&quot; is almost as good in my opinion, though once you have read it, the ending to Gone With The Wind is spoiled. Anyway, if you haven't read either of these books yet, I recommend you read them now or you'll regret it like I did!",
            "I started to read this book as a challenge - to see if I could actually finish it. I did, finally, (after about a month) and was really impressed. Actually, I was quite sad at the end of the last paragraph. It was definetly a classic book, but I don't intend on reading it again anytime in the near future.Scarlett O'Hara is a great character. Though bull-headed, nasty, and insensitive, she comes off as a believeable southern woman post-Civil War. She apparantly has no feelings whatsoever for those who care for her most, that is, she doesn't find out how much people mean to her until the very last chapter of the book. Still, she is strong, stubborn, can be sweet, and can get whatever she wants. And yes, she is a believeable character. I simply can not stand people who use the excuse that the character was unbelieveable. How is that? By saying that, you're saying that there could'nt be anyone in the world with the same qualities as that person? I don't think so.The only thing that bothered me about this was the fact that Scarlett didn't give a rat's a** about her children. Much to the point where they were afraid of her. That fact just might make some people hate her.But, all other matters aside, I don't think I can express enough how much I loved this book. It was beautifully written, with the right word choice (they would talk in big words all the time, so I was thankful that I could actually understand them!) and such. I know some people hated this book, but that's their opinion. I don't know why there is even such a thing as reviews. You just have to read the book for yourself and don't trust what anyone else says. And don't spend all your time going into such detail about the plot. That thing with Rhett's mentioned but not explained son really has no relevance to the plot. If you spend all your time looking at the downsides of the story, you'll never enjoy it. But, I do hope that you enjoy this book, because I think it it really great.",
            "GWTW was the very best. I always thought that there was no way that a book could really touch me, emotionally I mean. This was the only book that could accomplish that. Magaret Mitchell did a superb job writing this book, and I think that there never should have been a sequel written, for no continuation of the story could match the excellency of GWTW. I felt that the book ended well, and that if it had ended as a 'happily ever after' sort of thing, it wouldn't have been believable at all. Although I was crying at the end, I do believe it turned out correctly. I could not put it down! GWTW is timeless, and applies to everyone, so I recommend this book to every single person out there. Everyone can relate to the charecters in this book. A true classic, you've gotta read Gone With the Wind. I doubt I will ever find a book that can compare with the quality of it! Read it. PLEASE! We can all learn a lesson from the charecters in the book, especially Scarlett O'hara. A must read!",
            "When I was in middle school I shared my locker with my best friend. Her favorite movie and book were Gone With the Wind, we had posters in the locker and she talked about it non-stop. I looked at it, saw how long it was and laughed at her for her obccession.Now as a senior in college I decided to pick it up and see what all the fuss was about. I don't have a lot of time to read during the semester, but I had this book finished in less then 3 weeks. I didn't want to put it down, and it ate at me during classes to not know what was going on in Atlanta in my absence.This is quite possibly the most amazing book I have ever read. Mitchell's writting style is amazingly easy to read dispite the era she was writing during, and her descriptions make the state of Georgia come alive for a girl who has never left New England.The character of Scarlett both infuriated me and drew commanalities to myself. While sometimes you want to scream at the book and make her realize her love for Rhett hundreds of pages before she does, I think theres a little of every women in her. Her hopes and fears are still very real so many years later.I am so happy to have read this book, and now its one I'll reread in a few years. I highly reccamend it and am completely in love with it.",
            "I was 13 when I first read Gone with the Wind. It was a Chinese version. I couldn't remember who translated the book. All I could remember was that it was one of the most touching story I've ever read. I was encouraged by the Scarlett's passion and courage for life and touched by Rhett's patience and love.A few days ago, I picked up an English version of Gone of the Wind. It seems so much better than before. Maybe it's because that I'm now older and I can understand people's feelings in another dimension. Or maybe it's becuase I've moved to America and I had a better understanding of the western culture. I cried after reading it. I wish there was a different ending!",
            "What can I say about GWTW that hasn't already been said? The story is so captivating, and you can envision every scene because Margaret Mitchell describes every detail with such beautiful language. You really feel drawn back in time to the Old South and the Civil War. However, the characters are what really make the story so compelling, and the way they interact with each other is quite interesting because they are all so different. Scarlett O'Hara is probably one of the best literary characters ever created. She is very spoiled and self-centered, but I can't help but admire her strength and courage. There's also Rhett Butler, the handsome yet terribly scandalous man who loves Scarlett. Their relationship is definitely one of the greatest love stories ever written. You just have to read it! Don't be intimidated by the fact that it is over 1000 pages, the language is wonderful but not that complicated. If you haven't read this book, you're really missing out on a fantastic reading experience. Read it, and you will see why nearly seventy years after its initial publication, Gone With the Wind has not been forgotten.",
            "Just what the world needs. One more review of \"Gone With the Wind.\" I approached reading this book with a sense of trepidation. I looked at its 1,000+-page length, and doubted it was worth my time. I was afraid that it would be nothing more than an overblown historical romance novel. \"I'll think about it tomorrow\" summarizes the artistic merit of the book, I thought. Without the famous movie to sustain its reputation, who in their right mind would bother reading the book? Well, I was wrong. Looking beyond the soap opera of Scarlett, Rhett, and Ashley, I found things that really make this novel worthwhile. It's a richly detailed and historically accurate story of the Civil War and Reconstruction period, seen by those who bore the deprivations of daily life, not to mention the loss of loved ones. Although formatted as fiction, here we have living history. Margaret Mitchell draws deeply on her Georgia roots and gives the reader a uniquely Southern perspective of State Rights, slavery, Yankees, Carpetbaggers, Lincoln Republicans, and even the infamous Ku Klux Klan. Through the tribulations of Scarlett O'Hara, Mitchell argues that the Southern Cause appeared noble, but was ultimately foolish and futile. Above all, both Scarlett and Rhett Butler are practical people who doubt the sagacity of stifling social mores, and blind political affiliation. One can view Scarlett as the image of the South as she matures from a frivolous girl full of romantic notions into a strong, independent woman. Her pragmatism and steely resolve, forged on an anvil of personal suffering and survival, is another theme of the novel. It's easy to find the romantic melodrama of the surface plot distracting because it is fine entertainment. To enhance your reading pleasure, however, notice the rich historical detail and heed Scarlett's determination. As God is my witness, this is good reading. ;-)",
            "Going into this book, I was skeptical that I would enjoy it, as I am more into the Fantasy/Medievil genre. However, I don't know how anyone could not love this book. The characters are so real, the scenes so vividly described, and the feelings so profound that even I, someone not into the genre, couldn't get enough of it! Even though Scarlett was hostile towards loving Melanie, you couldn't help loving her! And I can actually see from the point of view of the Confederacy during the Civil War. It almost seems like their actions are justifiable, and we never learn this way of thinking in school! Over all, I have to say that Gone With the Wind lives up to it's reputation as one of the best novels of the 20th century!",
            "I first read this novel set during the Civil War when I was 12 years old. Shortly after that I was able to see the film version in an old downtown theater during one of its periodic rereleases. I was enthralled by both the novel and film. Is there anyone out there who doesn't know the plot? For the 10 people in the world who don't know, it features Scarlet O'Hara, a Southern belle, living that role to the hilt on her family's Southern, slave-worked plantation, when all hell breaks loose with the Civil War. Admirable for her survivor qualities, Scarlet is also manipulative and ruthless but meets her match in Rhett Butler, a Southerner who manages to move profitably among both sides of the War while most of the South is starving. I reread this novel as an adult, expecting that with my many more years of reading since that first read, that I would find the book over the top and soap opera like. It didn't happen. I couldn't put it down and had every bit as fascinating a time reading it again as I did the first time. If you haven't given it a reread in many a year, try it yourself and you'll be very pleasantly surprised.",
            "I have been reading &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; every couple of years since I was first &quot;allowed&quot; to read it at the age of 14! (In those days our mothers had higher hurdles for &quot;appropriate&quot; reading). When I was younger, I read this book once every year. I actually learned to read French without a dictionary by reading the French translation. (It's long enough to have that kind of linguistic influence! )The story of Scarlett O'Hara, a feisty and courageous southern &quot;belle&quot; whose beauty and sharpness was complicated by a lack of insight into human nature that ultimately left her unable to understand the hearts of those she most loved and by whom she was loved, until it was too late. It is also the story of the the South just before, during and after the Civil War.A more sympathetic portrait of the South than many other Civil war histories, it has aged fairly well, despite a slightly more patronistic view of African-Americans than one might be comfortable with today. Given its authorship dating back to the 1930s, I believe one needs to look at the book in the context of its historical period, and not to demean its historical or entertainment value simply because we are more aware and more sophisticated after the Era of Civil Rights in the United States. I also believe a sympathetic and well-educated person such as the author Margaret Mitchell seems to be, would have been the first to agree had she lived long enough to undergo that period of transformation in our country.Despite this limitation, few books of historical fiction are so well-plotted, and few characters in literature are so well-developed as that of Scarlett O'Hara, Rhett Butler, or Ashley and Melanie Wilkes--people I continue to feel like I &quot;knew&quot; in another time.The story is also that of Atlanta, a city which was relatively young and &quot;brash&quot; as a Confederate economic and cultural center, relative to Charleston and Richmond, the more sedate Confederate capitals.The book is valuable both as a historical text for those of us with little insight into the viewpoint of the South beyond that given in grade school textbooks, and as one of the most romantic dramas in American literature.I enjoyed reading this book as much at the age of 48 as I did almost 35 years ago (and many times in-between). I can't imagine a better summer read for a teenage girl, or a better way to relax at the beach for her mother, or a better way to pass a cold snowy vacation in front of a fire. Definetely a book for the romantically inclined.One should also note, that &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is one of the few books (until perhaps &quot;Cider House Rules&quot;) portrayed almost as well on film as the book is written. However the pleasures remain different and self-contained, and no enjoyment of either is lost by viewing or reading the other.",
            "This book is the best thing I've ever read in my life! The details are fantastic and the characters are well portrayed. The storyline is classic! This book immediately sucks you into the story and makes you really care about the characters in it. It made me laugh, it made me angry, it made me cry, and most of all it made my heart melt. I think this is the finest book ever written.",
            "Within the one thousand and twenty-four pages of this book, a reader is allowed to experience hardships, heartbreaks, shocking revalations, and most of all, an overwhelming emotionally-charged, intense book. This is one great book! Characters come alive, colors form before the eye of your imagination, shapes and sounds seem to ring in your ears, and undeniable passion sets fire to your heart. If you haven't read this experience of a lifetime, you are missing out on one of America's most treasured, true, and honest classics. (Those nights you will spend reading late into the hour and the tiredness of the next day are definatly worth it:)",
            "Reading Gone With The Wind is indeed an experience. It is able to change the opinion on romance stories for someone who does not like to read romance, it made me unable to put down the book even though I was busy.The story basically tells how the beautiful Southern belle Scarlett O Hara hardened during the American Civil War and her ruthless ways of making money even it means to marry someone whom she did not love as well as engaging the convicts to run the mills. The story also talks about the unusual love between Scarlett and Rhett Butler whom Scarlett hated intially and also the patriotism of the American Southerners. One could feel the different emotions of Human when reading the story such as jealousy, anger, honour between people and the country, love and so on. It is one unforgettable reading experience and Margaret Mitchell is indeed a talented writer whom I should say that it was regrettable that she was not the one who was writing the sequel to this story. Gone With The Wind is a highly recommended story.",
            "First I fell in love with the movie,then I read the book.The edition I have was my moms from the 1930's so i think its an original copy.This story is more than a love story. It is a study in human nature from Scarlets temper tantrums to Rhetts deep devoted love of Scarlet so much so that he has to leave her for his own good.This is undoubtly the best book ever written and by a newcomer at that. Margaret Mitchell outdid herself on this one.",
            "I was twelve years old when I first read this book and fell in love with Scarlett, Rhett, and the Old South. Now, 20 years later, I work in a bookstore and I still recommend this book to customers all the time. When people tell me that they have seen the movie, and therefore don't feel they need to read the book, I always strongly disagree with them. The book is so much better than the movie, and I'm sure I'll be recommending it to people for many years to come.",
            "One of the icons of American Literature and deservedly so.First read this when I was a teenager and my friends and I would ooh and aah over the scene near the beginning where Scarlett was trying to decide what to wear to the party at Ashley's plantation.I read it every couple of years thereafter and as I grew and matured so did my appreciation of this magnificent book. I first became more aware of how detailed Mitchell's research about the Civil War must have been (no matter how biased she was) and this prompted me to read more books both fiction and non-fiction about that period.My next level of maturity was demonstrated by subsequent reads where I became more impressed with Mitchell's willingness to avoid a standard HEA. She never painted Scarlett as anything but what the character demanded: a spoiled debutante whose world had not only collapsed but was blown away forever by the \"wind\". Scarlett's true, unvarnished, bottom line goal in life became to ensure that she and her family would survive and so would that representation of survival - Tara. Compared to the mores of that lost civilization, she seemed to have fallen from grace. In reality, she, being so very young, came to understand which of the values and mores of that civilization were worth keeping and what were just superficial and ignorant societal expectations. Unfortunately, she didn't realize this in time to obtain the greatest of those worthwhile values - true and reciprocated love. However, she did get what she needed and was looking toward the future with her trademark confidence and assurance.Just a fabulous, fabulous book.",
            "I had borrowed the audio from my local library, and after both realizing I wouldn't finish it in time, and that it was so very good I wanted to share it, I bought it. The narration is superb, and adds much to the story. After moving to Atlanta from Wisconsin I am familiar with many of the locations mentioned in the story. I also have begun to understand some of the old family Atlantans' feelings about what happened to their society.",
            "I cried when I finished this book. I honestly did. No, it was not the heart-breaking ending that brought me to tears, but the fact that there was no more Gone with the Wind. The book brought me so much into its depths, made me so much a part of its words, that at the end I felt almost as if a friend died. I just wish that Margaret Mitchell were alive so that I could talk to her, understand the mind that created such a masterpiece. I will never read a better book.",
            "Okay, everyone has been saying that this book is insulting, that it's racist, etc.Yes, it is extremely racist. Slavery is one of the most horrible inventions of the world. When slavery became race-oriented, it got even worse.But everyone really needs to take GWTW in perspective. First of all, the African-American slavery was hugely propagandized by the North U.S. There were a lot less beatings and brandings than is commonly perceived. The real horror of slavery was the psychological effect. Imagine that you've been told all your life that you are worthless, and fit only to be a slave. Wouldn't you conduct yourself in that way? That was the true horror of slavery. The reason that there were few beatings and brandings was even more horrible. It was because slaves were considered to be valuable property, and the plantation owners would as soon whip their valuable horses to death as whip their valuable slaves. The Northerners really didn't need to exaggerate bloodhounds and whippings; these stories are enough to get the North into a patriotic fervor. So GWTW, although ridiculously romanticized when it comes to slavery, is not completely incorrect. But it does fail to take into account the psychological effects that I just mentioned. It also fails the characterize the black characters in the narrative.Despite all these faults, GWTW is not meant to cater to modern views or even what we would call \"just\" views. It is meant to depict the Southern attitude at the time of the Civil War and the Reconstruction. Obviously, since everyone is incredibly incensed about its attitude, it succeeds remarkably well.Second of all, the movie romaticizes the already romantic book. Mitchell did not portray the rich plantationers in GWTW, she portrayed the middle-class, uneducated pioneers, with the exception of the Wilkes family. They were not contemptuous towards Crackers and poor whites because they were only a step and some luck above them. Essentially they had started out in their position. Gerald O'Hara is harldy anyone's estimation of the typical rich, supercilious, high-class planter. There weren't any stereotypical planters in Georgia, anyway, not before or after the Civil War. It was more a homesteading state than a Kentucky.So, overall, GWTW did exactly what it set out to do. And yes, it really neglects the black psychological view and focuses mainly on Scarlett's and Rhett's, with a couple of other characters. But this is also in character of the time. If anyone really wants to read a clarifying book about GWTW, read Southern Daughter. It ought to help with the rather confused opinions being circulated about GWTW.",
            "This has to be the best book ever written. Scarlett, Rhett, Melanie, and Ashley were brought to life within those 1,024 pages. You felt there sorrows, joys, worries, and loves. I loved Rhett, he was such a character! Melanie is larger than life, and too good for Scarlett. As long as she had Ashley, she was unaffected by the war. Ashley was a gentleman in an era he did not belong in. He was simply an ornament not a laborer. Rhett was everything a character could be, (not to mention very dashing.) Scarlett is probably the only character that you love one chapter and hate the next. She had a very strong will to survive and a lot of selfishness. She was strong enough to survive the war, but she was not as strong as Melanie, (mentally.) My very favorite characters were the Tarleton twins, espically Brent. I do think Melanie was not very strong (physically) but she made up for it with her huge heart, you would have to have one to always stand up for Scarlett. My favorite part of the book is when Scarlett and Rhett are on their honeymoon. They were really, truly in love then. I would think Scarlett would love Rhett long before she did. He was so kind and loving to Bonnie. I think Rhett really did love her the whole time, and he really would not leave her. Why didn't Scarlett marry Stuart? The book would be very different, but Scarlett loved him. GREAT BOOK!",
            "Oh my god!!! i just fifnished GWTW like an hour ago and i still keep bursting into tears. is that normal? maybe for other people but not for me. You must read this book- my sister read it when she was 13 and was waiting untill i was 13 for me to read it- i cant even begin to tell you how wonderfull this book is but i will try. it is a historic romance and is set during the Civil War in mainly Atlanta. Scarlett is a southern belle who has everthing done for her. she is shelfish and spoiled but we love her! Its like everything she did to be lady like just made her less lady like. everything that she does that is so hurtful she has a great reason for doing but she cannot see what the long term effect is and she just drives everone away! she loves a man who loves her but cannot marry her so to hurt him she marries a man she dosent love and thats when you get tottaly absorbeb into the BEST BOOK EVER!!! if i start with how great Meli and rhett are ill cry again!

            "I thought it was well written but rather lenghtly. The author has an excellent vocabulary. I'm reading it again. The story came alive for me.",
            "Gone with the Wind is a classic I read during my teenage years yet I had to purchase it in physical form since when I read it I had burrowed it from a library. For all of you who have not read this novel, it is a historical fiction romance novel about a girl who had it all, lost it all and had to learn to stop being so vain. It is a story that will never come out of the line of favorite books to read so one must read it at least one in our lifetime!",
            "I first read GONE WITH THE WIND many years ago. I read it again every few years. Why not? In spite of the long list of criticisms (melodramatic, insensitive, sexist, racist, materialism, soap opera, etc.) it is undeniably magnificent. Writers, this is a great book to read backwards---last chapter, then forward, chapter by chapter. You will learn a lot about writing if you do this.",
            "This novel is, I'm certain you must know by now, a family saga covering the Civil War and Reconstruction in the South from the viewpoint of a wealthy Southern family who live on a plantation called 'Tara.'Easy to read, 'Gone With the Wind' is not only a family saga, but a fascinating character study of people who did what they had to do in order to survive the devastating war years and the reconstruction that followed. Lives and lifestyles were changed forever with the Civil War. Southerners had to adapt to an entirely foreign way of life and this novel explores how different people coped in the form of well-developed, complex characters.Difficult to put down, this novel is one you will read over and over again and eventually pass down to your children. Don't hesitate to buy a copy!",
            "This book probably has more reviews written for it than any other that I've seen on the Amazon site. As I said, I don't know what I can add that others haven't already said...but I have often thought, as I have read and re-read this wonderful novel, that I don't think Scarlett would get Rhett back in the end. I always thought Rhett was far more intelligent, well-rounded, and wise than she, and that an awful lot of his longing for her was comprised of her lack of availability (her heart, that is, that heart that belonged only to Ashley), and her looks. After all, when did he fall for her? When he looked up at her on the staircase and she was wearing that low-cut green-sprigged dress!The fascinating characters that Mitchell so deftly brings to life are what make this novel so unforgettable. I don't know that any of them are truly believable, but somehow that doesn't matter. The writing style is dated (all those exclamation points!), and of course the dialect and political viewpoints are atrocious in this day and age. The amazing thing is that none of this matters as we find ourselves caught up in Scarlett's world, a world, as Mitchell so poignantly writes,that was gone with the wind.When Rhett tells Scarlett at the end, \"I won't be pursued as the luckless Ashley was pursued,\" I believe he meant it. The fact that he could coin a phrase like, \"Someone or something has convinced you that your lover is too large a piece of Dead Sea fruit for even you to chew\" (not sure if I'm quoting this 100% correctly, but I've memorized large portions of the dialogue through re-reading) simply showcases how much more extensive his intellect is than Scarlett's. He realizes now that she no longer holds any appeal for him; her charm for him, simply, was her unattainable-ness. (not a word, either - sorry!)I never read the sequel. To me, that would be a sacrilege. Mitchell always said that for her, the novel ended when it ended. But no one who reads it can resist pondering...\"Did she get him back?\" And I say no.But read it anyway. It's a long read, but oh, such an enjoyable one.",
            "This book is now my favorite book of all time (it contends with the Bible people!) and is the reason I am grateful to have sight and the ability to read, to enjoy masterpieces like this. I will admit the first 100 pages were slightly slow, but necessary to build the story. I loved learning more about the Civil War and appreciated seeing it from a perspective that often gets shrouded in history. Slavery was never ok but this book allowed me to explore slavery from the South's point of view. I also loved Scarlet, even with all her downfalls, and enjoyed the book most all when Rhett was highlighted.Every American should be required to read this book! That is how passionately I loved it.Also, the un-sequel Scarlet was a lovely read. Some contest that Mitchell's work should have been left alone and I can see their point. However, I wasn't ready to say good-bye to Scarlet just yet. No, the sequel does not quite compare to the original, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend the sequel to those who secretly want a happier ending for Scarlet.",
            "GWTW-I discovered it on the shelf of my highschool library & having never heard of it, I decided I would read it. I was completely unprepared for the ride! While we all want to be Melanie, the truth is-we're all a little Scarlett on the inside! I have since read the book many times (and of course own the DVD) and never tire of it. A definite book for gals-you get a glimpse into southern life at the time of the Civil War and experience a love story of enormous preportions. \"Fiddle Dee Dee\" is our catch phrase around the house! LOVED IT>",
            "Do yourself a favor and order Gone with the Wind now. Just make sure you have a lot of time to devote to this book, because once you start reading it, you won't be able to stop. Margaret Mitchell's classic is a fantastic, almost hypnotizing read and Scarlett O'Hara is one of the best --if not the best-- characters in American fiction of all time.",
            "well, english is not my mother tongue but I speak it well enough to love this book. Maybe I'm not completely objective since I have seen the movie for about 10 time before I had read the book (this means I'm crazy about the movie) but still some things are slightely different then they are portrayed in the movie. First of all, there are a lot of characters that the film does not mention (which are quite important, but still, does not change the point) and the book is a lot more unfair I might say, to the slaves (only after reading I realized why there are, if any, contoversies surrounding GWTW phenomenon). They are often portrayed as silly, not so bright people (although very, very lovely and loving) and in the movie they are very smart, prudent people that often help when white people couldn't, that often show more courage and intelligence then the wihite people do and that's why I like them better portrayed in the film. But the things why I absolutely love GWTW, love between Rhett and Scarlett and deep friendship between Scarlett and Melanie, stay the same. So, all in all, I truly recommend this book first of all, to all the GWTW fans (because they CAN'T go wrong with reading it) and then to all the others who'd like to find out thing or two about how things were back in the old South, meet really great characters that are above all, believable and convincing and read about the greatest love story of our time, as it's been said on the covers.",
            "I loved this book but the end reduced me to tears. And Rhett ,Rhetts character made me love him literally love him like Scarlett did lin the end. When I was reading this book I felt like I was Scarlett and when he said he did not love her I felt like he was saying that to me . I'm sad that Margaret Mitchell died before she could make the sequel because I fell in love with Rhett ! My heart is empty right now . Oh Rhett ! By: Heart Broken",
            "Amazing peice of work, and should be read by everyone. This is the best written novel I have ever read, and probably will be the ebst written novel I will ever read in my lifespan. This book has so much detail, the way the characters are described are almost impossible to compare to any book written. Not only is this an epic, but I find it to be a historical epic; it navigates through the years, when the civil war started (or months before it began), through the civil war, the end and the reconstruction. The reconstruction is something that is not ever really written about, and the novel actually depicts what the south is going through after the civil war.Some people might find Scarlett, to be selfish and well...a bitch. But I loved her! Wither her the entire story wouldn't work! I found her love over ashley to be rather mezmerizing, who would spend years after someone, and into three marriages?Scarlett! I thought the most detailed part, were the settings especially rhett's and Scarlett's dream home, talk about having a nice mansion!",
            "Gone with the Wind is an epic tale of a Southern belle, living through the time that was the Civil War. Scarlett O'Hara, a beautiful yet harsh young woman, is the female protaganist, and the story follows her journey, beginning in a time when all is well; the balls, the parties, the beaux. Her vindictive and manipulative nature pushes her to make a mistake or two, and she finds herself widowed soon after the war has started. The novel leads the audience through the abundance of obstacles Scarlett must endure, allowing the reader to sympathise with her during the lost love of Ashley Wilkes, the neglected love of Rhett Butler, and the terrible times she experiences throughout the war.Margaret Mitchell, despite the fact that Gone with the Wind is her first and only novel, narrates the story with an ease in both the plot and the dialogue, throwing the audience head first into a world where the negroes work for the white man, where war has broken out, and where it is innappropriate to wear a dress revealling your bosom in the morning.Compared to other anecdotes narrating stories of the Civil War, Gone with the Wind is not only a tear-jerker, but a tale that captures hearts, and fingers; leaving readers unable to put the book down.",
            "Hey Everyone! I absolutely LOVE this book. Everybody thought that I was crazy because I am 11 years old and I read a book with over 1,000 pages. But the book turned out to be wonderful! I would recommend it to everybody. The tale of Scarlett O'Hara stole my heart. Margaret Mitchell is a wonderful author and a great story teller. Everybody has to read this stupendous novel at least one time in their life!",
            "I never thought a book good be so beautiful, so wonderful, good enough to eat. I saw the movie in 3rd grade and fell in love with it. I decided to go to my school library and pick up a copy of the book. I started reading and even the librarian couldnt believe that such a young child, with such an adult book.My teacher, and class mates, IMPRESSED! For me, I never wanted to stop. From Twelve Oaks to Tara, the thrill never ends. So I finished it with partly understanding but then re-read it in sixth grade. The words that were chosen to make this book, is truly amazing. I have to hand it to your Margaret Mitchell, for creating the best book that America will ever know. Because with all of the books I have read and with all of the books I am going to read, I know there is nothing like, \"Gone with The Wind.\" \"Frankly My dear...there is nothing like it!\" So I am suggesting you start reading it soon, because if you dont have time to day, dont worry . . . \"Because tomorrow is another day,\"",
            "The many adventures of a spoiled, vain, and annoying adolescent living in Georgia during the Civil War era. I read this book at least once yearly just for the mental time travel. Boy, could Margaret Mitchell paint a picture! I always feel as though I'm right on Peachtree Street with Scarlett O'Hara, and I never fail to get mad at her for losing Rhett. Everyone should try this at least once.",
            "Scarlett O' Hara has to be the most famous character ever written in all of literature. Her story about coming to age just when the Civil War began and having to learn everything she was taught is of no use to her during war and after war is a must read for anyone. Her transformation into a shrewd, lying and spoiled southern belle is just about the best for any reader who loves stories based on the southern way of life. I just have to say this book is not racist and it was never intended to be. Many people just think it is because now we are bombarded into thinking blacks are the victims of society due to them having been slaves. People this is the story of Scarlett O'Hara living in times when not many black people were educated. Some blacks were but many were not as the belief back then was that blacks were just not too smart to learn. Which we now know is not true. But one thing is true and what many of us now have to understand is that many blacks who were slaves did not want to be freed. Where were they going to go and what were they going to do after being free? What did they know about this strange land being freed? How were they going to survive? They didn't know and they didn't know anything about taking the intiative of oneself instead of being told what to do. And many blacks were defending the then southern way of living. Many slaves did love there slaveowners and wanted to remain with them. Many slaves did fight on the Confederate side willingly. Even when the south did lose the war many ex-slaves did stay with they're ex-slave owners because in they're way of thinking they still belonged to them. It was a mutual love. They did die fighting believing in the Confederate way of thinking. They were not brainwashed it was just they way of living that they knew. They loved there white folk like many Mammies did love there white kids as if they were they're own children. We have to remember that the way of thinking was completely different back then. We have to remember if that way of thinking was now we would think the same way. Love knows no barriers. The love of another to another is just that. Even if it meant a slave-owner loving his slave like a slave loved his owner. Didn't God have a commandment to treat your slave with respect and to give him his seventh year free. The bad people of this story were the carpetbaggers. They caused so much damage in this country back then that the states suffered it for years because of them. They lied to the ex-slaves by telling them to vote them into office and then wanting to have nothing to do with them. As Margaret Mitchell tells in the book many blacks were put into also. I read many books about this subject and it is true. The most ignorant and hateful towards white were put into office. They saw this as a way to get back at the whites for having them in slavery. But that is not it. Many slaves saw it as revenge because of the wrong done unto them by being slaves. What the carpetbaggers did was poison the minds of the ex-slaves by telling them it was wrong and it was wrong but they made them hate the whites by telling lies about how many whites ex-slaveowners beat, torture, and rape and commit atrocities against the blacks. Okay yes it did happen. But like many stories it was embellished. Only about a one percent of the whites did own plantations. Something we dont't believe but it is true. We have been taught that all whites back then were rich and made they're riches on the backs of blacks. That's not true. If it was then there would be more blacks in this country then there are whites. WE as a people of this time know our TIME only, meaning now or present time. We are a product of the liberal public education system. I mean we don't know our history or any other countries either. We love to embellish the past, everybody now who was of voting age swear up and down that they voted for Kennedy when he was running for the presidency. That is a complete lie. So everybody who now who is black (this is excluding the newly arrived black Africans) swear up and down they came from slaves. That is a lie also. Many black families immigrated into the US after the Civil War and after the nineteen hundreds. So many black people can't say they came from slaves. What I am saying is that the Jessie Jacksons and Al Sharptons of this world have poisoned many black people of this country to the point of wanting to hurt them and keep them enslaved in hatred towards the whites of this country. We should remember the civil war but not be embittered by it.",
            "What is the point of reviewing this book? Everyone knows that it is amazing - the movie won many Oscars and got 5 stars, a rare rating for a movie. I read this 1024 page-turner in about 1 month. It takes a little while to get into the story, but not long. Scarlett's character does get a little frustrating at times, you just want to yell at her so she understands!! But that's what makes this book a definite classic. There shouldn't be anybody in the world without this book on their bookshelves, and I mean anybody. And what is even better is owning an older version, or even a first edition! This book makes you want to know everything about it: the movie, the author, a sequel!! Speaking of that, there is &quot;Scarlett: The Sequel to Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind&quot; by Alexandra Ripley. I would definitely recommend that also, I'm about half way through it. Though the author is different, you get into her style quickly and fall back into the romance of Scarlett and Rhett. I would suggest saving the movie (if you haven't seen it) for after reading the book. A great summer read. Worth the $6!!!",
            "This is without a doubt the best book in the world! I loved the way Margret Mitchell made the charecters so realistic. If you don't read this book you will be missing out on alot. The ending however is heartbreaking. I have read this book a dozen times and it never gets boring. I love the witty remarks of Rhett. This is a book you don't want to miss out on.",
            "It was amazing to me how much I could love a book with so few admirable characters. (One wonders if the film, &quot;The War of the Roses&quot; might not have been contrived from the story of Rhett and Scarlett.) But in all of her rage, Scarlett's stength and determination still makes her an attractive character, and after all of her shenanigans, you still want her to win. When assessing the characters, it is important to remember that they lived in a society where they played by different rules, often rules difficult for us to understand (e.g. rules regarding what constitutes adultery; and unbending rules of loyalty that might otherwise escape many of us). But all in all, beauty seems only to be found in Melanie and Mammy; a pitiful sympathy for Ashley and the other fallen &quot;Old Guard&quot;; and a most certain feeling that, indeed, Scarlett and Rhett, deserved each other, pain and all.",
            "I always thought &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; would forever hold the title.But &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; may surpass it.As a damn yankee,I discovered I belong south of the Mason-Dixon line,where women are treated respectfully,parents are honored,loyalty to family and friends are boundless,and others postive traits exhibited,that are much too scarce today.Read this book and also find yourself wishing to protect and risk your life for Scarlett!",
            "I grew up watching the movie version of Gone With the Wind, and I first read the novel when I was in 9th grade. If you only see the movie, you miss out on so much. This story literally has a little of everything in it. Don't let the length scare you away-it is such an amazing book, don't miss out on it!",
            "This novel is acknowledged as one of, if not the best and most popular novels ever written. It deserves just that because of the universal appeal of its themes. The story starts with Scarlett O'Hara, a charming, determined but stubborn and proud Southern belle, trying to get the heart of Ashley Wilkes, who is to marry all-so-sweet and kind Melly, heartily hated by the leading lady. After over 1000 pages it ends with Scarlett realization that she really loves charming not such a gentleman Rhett Butler, who is also very proud and stubborn.In between the first and the last pages there are 12 years of Scarlett's life, from 16 to 28, Civil War, 3 marriages (the last of them is with Rhett Butler), 3 kids, wealth, poverty, and then wealth again, unseen love of Rhett Butler, death of all beloved, her maturity from a child into a woman, and finally the realization of the true priorities in her life. Unfortunately it is too late, they are all gone with the wind...",
            "This book is one of the best ever written. It should be one of the books every family owns, right up there with Shakespeare. This beautifully crafted story takes you through 12 years of Scarlett O'Hara's life, and her heartbreaking romance. This book is impossible to put down once you start it.... everyone should read it. It's not tacky, or wishywashy... but real, and it touches the soul... trust me...read this book.",
            "Wow...Now this is a wonderful book. Gone With The Wind is something I know i should have read years ago! GWTW is so superbly a tale of the old south, and how it's changed by war. I was taken not only by it's vivacious and lively characters, but by it's wonderful forshadowing. And Rhett Butler, I just love to hate him!Gone With The Wind is a total must read!",
            "Me being 11yrs. old didn't think that I would like this book. Boy was I wrong. This is my favorite book of all time! The only thing that I didn't like about the book which I know almost everybody will agree with me on is that it ends so suddenly not even giving you a hint to the outcome. Margaret Mitchell is so good that she can even capture an eleven yr. olds mind with an adult book. This book is easy to put people you know in the characters spots and just sit there all day and daydream a new ending. Did I mention that I loved this book?",
            "I first read GWTW, when I was just a kid and fell in love with it from the first line. No other book has come close to how I feel about this novel (save for Pride and Prejudice, Persuasion and Rebecca all running close seconds!)If you have only seen the movie version of this book, please do yourself a huge favor and read the book. It is amazing! Scarlett has so much more depth as a person than the way she is portrayed in the movie (Vivien Leigh was a perfect Scarlett don't get me wrong) You will come to understand her motives completely if you just read the Book! Apparently I cannot stress this enough. This is just the best book ever written!",
            "Ok, here's the deal. This book was great. I mean GREAT! I read it in 6th grade. The whole thing was so, so, so wonderful! I luved every bit of it, Except for.....the end. I hated the end! Why did she just leave us hanging? I mean Tomorrow everything will be alright? What kind of ending is that? So I had to get Scarlett. I luved Scarlett too. And I was glad that there was actually an ending, but the ending was kind of boring.",
            "This book was beautifully written, and had just the right amount of romance, action, drama, and loneliness that it became a captivating novel. I could not put this one down. It is unforgetable.",
            "Gone With the Wind is the best book I've ever read! It is breathtaking and thrilling. It describes the civil war along with Scarlett's life during it. It is a really wonderful book that takes you back in time. I loved this book. I am only 13, and I think anyone my age should read this book, because it rocks. It is sad, but still its the best. Read it, and I know you'll love it",
            "&quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; was one of the most exciting books the I have ever read. I really like the part when Ashley all of a sudden has feelings for her. But, the best part about the book is how I could not put the book down. I first read the book 5 years ago when I was in the fifth grade, but then I re-read it last year. I understood it even more. I am now trying to give it to people so that they can read it. It is also one of my favorite books. I recommend this book to anybody, male or female, young or old. So enjoy &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;.",
            "I noticed that there are no Arabs casting their opinions, so i am glad to give you mine. When i was 14, my father gave me a special edition for the youth, and told me:&quot; read this book, you will enjoy it&quot;. Well, ladies and gentelmen i started reading it in Thursday afternoon, and i didn't put it untill Friday night. The book is simply wonderfull, and later when i was growing up (i am 28 now) i read the full version two more times, and some passages ( especially the first encounter between Scarlet and Rhett at the library)countless times. I think the strength of the book lies in its strong and very believble characters ( although i think there is little exaggeration in the power and charm of Rhett). The supporting characters are very believble as well, and although you might think that there is huge diffrence between USA and the Arab world, but the truth is we are people, and apart from few diffrences, the basic emotions, and behaviour are almost the same, that is why the book has such an enourmous success in all the world and with all ages and throughout its history. And as one of the reviewr pointed, that each country knew some major changes to its society, another reason why the book was a huge success. As for the romantic story, it is very powerfull as well. Finally, i would like to say, that i am almost Copy of Ashely Wilkes( without the skill of riding ..lol), and usualy i like the types of Melanie, but you can't help your self and admire Scarlett as a fiction heroine, although i doubt very much i would like her if i met her. I personaly strongly recommend this book.BUT i would like to make a warning for everyone thinking of reading the sequell, because the sequell is no more than a litreature piracy in my opinion, and it is a pure rubbish, and you can better buy a cheap romantic novel insted.I woul love if someone sent me an e mail.",
            "This book is even better than the movie--really! I began reading this as an escape from a pretty hectic time in my life, and couldn't put it down for about three days, until I got Scarlet out of the danger of the war. This novel combines romance, strength, family loyalty, love of home, and many other values into one exciting story. Definitely check this out!",
            "I first read Gone With the Wind as a freshman in high school, and now 6 years later it's still one of my favorites. I have always loved the movie version, and the book is even better. Mitchell creates wonderful characters--you may not LIKE all of them, but they're amazing nonetheless.GWTW is just amazing southern lit...it may seem long, but trust me it flies by. If you like the movie then definitely read the book--you won't be disappointed.",
            "Over the summer, a friend and I made a deal that she would read To Kill A Mockingbird, one of my all-time favorite books, if I would get through Gone With the Wind. I agreed, although it was hardly a fair deal, seeing as how GWTW is over 1000 pages, and TKAMB is a mere 300...but it was the best thing I ever did. Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind is an incredible book--Scarlett O'Hara is the single most unforgettable heroine I have ever encountered--and though I often felt like strangling her for her selfishness, stupidity, and greed, I fell completely in love with her anyway. I came to know her so well by the end of the book that for awhile after I was finished, there was a bit of a hole in my life, and I missed reading about her as I would miss a friend on vacation. Fortunately, all I had to do was open the book back up, and I was again immersed in southern Civil War America. Scarlett, Rhett, Melanie, Ashley--each and every one became like a dear friend, I knew their thoughts, their feelings so well. There are not guarantees that everyone who picks up this amazing book will be able to finish it--but if you can, you are in for the time of your life.",
            "Gone With The Wind is a timeless romance that depicts agreat picture of what life was like during and after the Civil War. Once loved by all the men in the County, Scarlett's life takes a turn after the war. She ends uo in Atlanta where her reputation is ruined by gossip. The ending was kind of disappointing, but it leaves plenty of room to imagine what could happen. There is something for everyone to relate to in this book. I have no doubt that this book will always be remembered as the greatest romance novel of all time.",
            "This was another book to be read and studied in English class. Every one of my peers thought that this book was going to be like most of the other books that we had had to read that year, but I wasn't so sure, as I was just beginning to learn to love the classics and literature books in the library. So, being curious, I read the 1024 page book in under a week, and I found it a marvelous book. It touches wonderfully on the hardships and problems of the civil war years in the South, and the feelings of the proud Southerners toward the Yankees and slaves after the war had ended and they found themselves stripped of their old ways of the plantation living (this book mainly touches on the lifestyles of the richer plantation owners, rather than the majority of Southerners, or the poor ones who owned just a little farm, and often no slaves). It centers around the story of Scarlett O'Hara, daughter of a great lady and a rich Irish plantation owner. It is a funny and charming story of Scarlett's love problems: she can have any man that she wants in the South, yet she wants an engaged man! The book goes through her funny predicaments and actions as she struggles to stay alive in the present, with her dreams of the past behind her...It also goes on about a notorious man named Rhett Butler, who associates himself with Scarlett, and yet who is not accepted in any home in Atlanta, Georgia, nor the South for that matter. This book is recommended to anyone who likes romance stories or books with heroines in them. In fact, I recommend this to anyone who can stand reading long, wonderful books.",
            "Gone With the Wind takes place in the 1800's and is about an American girl named Scarlett O'Hara trying to fit in Atlantas society . Scarlett is a ordinary girl who just seems to bend the rules a little.She goes to parties and balls like all other girls. The Civil War starts and turns her world upside down. She has to learn to do things that women don't do but she does it just to survive. She learns to work the fields, runs lumber mills,and a store. Society throws her out because she is doing things women wouldn't dare do even to survive. She has to deal with all the hardships of war.She loses many loved one due to fighting and starvation. While all of this is happening she meets a man named Rhett Butler who helps her tremendelsy. He picks her up from all of her troubles and survive and tries to get back her place in society. I would recommend this book for anyone who likes romance novels.",
            "Gone with the Wind is a classic that everyone should read. This book is filled with romance, adventure, and hope. Watch Scarlett weave her way through different husbands and lovers while trying to keep her family alive. As opposed to Melanie, Scarlett is rather self-centered and never really changes, she does not care what anyone thinks of her and is prepared to do her own thing. Melanie is a loving, caring, considerate young women who always wants the best for everyone, including her husband, Ashley and Scarlett. I think that this is a great book that is really worth reading. There is constatantly hope for better times, even when better times have come.",
            "Being a Atlanta belle myself and seeing the movie many times I decided to read the book. The begining was quite boring, but after I to page 300 or so I really started to enjoy the book. I really like it and was really sad when it ended, but some or the things I didn't understand. Scarlett really seemed to marry Frank for his money, but she also seemed to love him because she gave him a kid and she slept with him for a couple of years. She seems to dislike her kids, but at times she acts like she couldn't leave them for anything. I really felt sorry for Rhett in the end because in the movie he doesn't tell how much he loves her. The movie doesn't really interpret how bad Scarlett's live was effected by the war. I really loved the book and really wished Margaret Mitchell had a chance to write a second book.",
            "I had seen the movies like 20 thousand times when I decided to read the book. I got to about page 250 when I stopped uninterested. About three months later on a dare I checked out Scarlett and started to read it. I really loved it, but many of the characters mentioned were people I had never heard of in the movie. Very confused and wanting to get it all figured out I got GWTW and started to read it again. This time I made myself keep reading and after about page 400 it started to get really interesting. I read from page 400 to the end in two and a half days and was terribly upset when it ended. I think this a great book and know I am on a search for ever Civil War book written.",
            "I just finished this book and LOVED IT! The development of the book is great. The character development is great. IT'S JUST GREAT! Yet when she argues with Ashley it get's oh so gooey! If you want to read it but freaked by the fact that it's 1036 pages, trust me, Mrs. Mitchells writing style is easy and american and you'll be under its spell in no time!",
            "Gone with the Wind lived up to its reputation and then some. It is a story of the south at the time of its fall. It is a story of Scarlett O'Hara and her journey from being a immature Southern Bell to a mature intelligent women. It is a fantatisc romance novel.",
            "The first time I read GWTW was in the 8th grade. At that time, I didn't comprehend a lot of what went on with the characters. A couple of months ago I read it a second time--14 years after the first time. What an amazing difference it was! I truly related to Scarlett and Rhett. They are the all-time couple. The only part I hated was Bonnie's death. I think that affected me more now that I have a child of my own and I could feel the grief that Rhett was feeling. I will most likely read it again. It made me laugh out loud, think and want to cry. A very emotional read!",
            "I'm fourteen years old, and I read both Gone With the Wind and its sequel, Scarlett. This book is truly amazing. It's a story about Scarlett O'Hara, the belle of Clayton County, who falls in love with a man already engaged. She marries another man for spite, and, when he dies, she marries yet another in order to financially support her family farm. All this while, Scarlett is still deeply in love with the man she can not have. Finally, as her friend Rhett, a blockade runner, realizes she is his dream, Scarlett finally finds where her love really should go...too late.",
            "I am but 11 years old but I have read this book, and BELIEVE ME, it is definitely worth it. This book made me sob hysterically, laugh like a maniac, and understand what it was like to live during the Civil War. It actually made me wish I could have been alive during that time. My favorite character was definitely Melly. I won't spoil it for you but you have to read it.",
            "Wow, when i read this book i couldn't put it down! I actually saw the movie first,so when i read the book, I had an Idea what the charicters looked like. But i did not know that the movie was only half the story! I loved the movie just as much as the book, though others didnt. I have not read the sequal and im not planning to, from what i heard about it.My favorite charictor is Rhett. I dont know why. I think it is because whenever he popped up in the book, he always made me smile. I think that it was rhett and Melanie that made scarlett strong. They were standing behind her and pushing her along the way. Without them, Scarlett would not have been nearly as strong as she was. Gone with the Wind has some kind of charm that i cannot explain. From the first page it grabs you that no other book could posobly do. In this frenzy that we call our world, i know tht there was land of grace, beauty and, true love. Please read it!!",
            "What can I say? I LOVED this book. The characters were great, and the story was incredible! I love a book that can make you feel lots of emotions. I actually cried(a lot)! I don't do that a lot when I'm reading a book. It also made me feel happy, angry, blah blah, etc. The only possible downside is that the way slavery is depicted makes it seem better than it really was. But read it anyway, it's great!!! Oh, BTW, read the book first! It was so much better than the movie!",
            "I can truly understand why this book is so beloved to American culture. It has every single element of a great story written beautifully. The length may be daunting but I was surprised at what a &quot;short&quot; book it was to read. I absolutely loved Scarlett, though I wasn't so enthusiastic about melanie. If you haven't read it, you are MISSING OUT on something fabulous!",
            "This book is just wonderful! It's much better than the movie! I love how it is written, and how the charactors seem so real. Scarlett is so strong, but yet so misguided to what she wants. This isn't a perfect ending, but life doesn't always give a perfect ending, and that's what I like about GWTW.

            "I ablsolutely loved this book! It always kept me turning the pages. The descriptions were wonderfull and the story was the best ever!! This book will remain my favorite and it will always be remembered as a master piece. I recommend this book because I loved it and know you would too.",
            "This book is the best book i've ever read...it deserves more than a 5 star.I watched the movie last year and all i could remember is me smiling =) and crying =**|...it touched my heart! You've gotta read the book...you'll love it. Watch the movie too...it's a classic!***************************=)",
            "The novel Gone With the Wind was so beautifuly written that I cried at the end. This book descibes the south at the time before, after, and during the Civil War. It shows the strenth of a lady, Scarlett during these times. I love how Scarlett says at the end that she would think of it tomorrow at Tara. This is the best way Margrett Mitchell could have ended the book. Margrett did a outstanding job writting GWTW.",
            "This classic Civil War-era romance novel won the Pulitze Prize in 1937 and was made into the classic movie audiences around the world know and love two years later. This terrific saga begins before the Civil War (which the Union won four years later, paving the way for the 14th Amendment, which ended slavery in 1865, several months after Abraham Lincoln's assassination) and ends during Reconstruction. I won't go over the plot again, as many who've either read the book or seen the movie (or both) know what it's about. Those who haven't read it, read the editor's reviews. One major difference between the book and the movie is that the book has a lot of cursing and the movie only has one swear word: \"Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn.\" The way Rhett (Clark Gable, who won Best Actor in 1934 for the delightful screwball comedy \"It Happened One Night\"; review coming soon) says that to Scarlett (Vivien Leigh, in the role that won her her 1st Academy Award for Best Actress; the 2nd one was also for Best Actress in \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" in 1954) makes it seem like it's not a bad word at all. Watch the movie AFTER reading the book, you'll appreciate it more. The book is rated PG-13 for intense thematic elements, strong vulgar language, mild war violence, some images of wounded, violence, intense domestic conflict, mild sensuality and brief nudity. The movie is rated G.SCARLETTEveryone expected a sequel to \"Gone With The Wind,\" but those hopes went up in smoke when Margaret Mitchell died in 1939, the same year the classic movie (see my review on it) came out and three years after it was published. Imagine how surprised I was when I found out about the sequel, advertised on the back cover of the Large Print Edition that I borrowed countless times from my local library before buying it from \"Doubleday Book Club\" (rarely do they have anything worth buying). Alexandra Ripley (who is she?) wrote this follow-up with the \"Permission\" of the Mitchell Estate and look at the result. True, the story picks up where the original left off, but a twist of the supernatural (what the hell was she thinking?!!) just ruined the novel. It too was turned into a movie starring Joanna W.-Kilmer and Timothy Dalton (two-time James Bond in \"The Living Daylights\" and \"Licence To Kill\" [see my reviews on them]), which I don't know if it's any good. Ripley got some things right (adding more backstory to Rhett, etc), but she completely missed the mark on others (killing Mammy off, what the devil were you on, cocaine?) It's good reading if you want to find out what happens between Rhett and Scarlett, one of the most famous love affairs in literature, but if you expect the sequel to be as good as the original, don't bother. The novel is rated PG for some violence, mild language and brief nudity.GONE WITH THE WIND:5 starsSCARLETT:2/1/2 stars",
            "(that is if it takes 6 weeks to read... so you better start reading!!!)In a word... you will RELIVE Scarlett's experience and she will become a person to you :) If you are a person who likes drama and human emotion, then this is the book for you! The fact that it is set against the chaotic background of the American Civil War is just an added bonus since the real storyline of the book is the tale of a woman's struggle against time and change when her world is falling apart.",
            "This book was very well written. It was a classic. I was intrigued at how well Margaret Mitchell spun this story together. Scarlett was a character that had so many different characteristics about her than I doubted it would ever end. You meet Scarlett O'Hara in Tara and soon you find out of her passionate love for Ashley Wilkes. War is declared on the South and Ashley marries his cousin Melanie Wilkes. Scarlett becomes jealous and as a way to get back at him she marries Melanie's own brother, Charles Wilkes. Charles and Ashley go to war leaving Melanie in Atlanta and Scarlett in Tara. Shortly after Scarlett gets a telegram informing her of her husbands death. She is desperate to get out of black widow's clothes. She goes to Atlanta to stay with her Aunt Pittypat while she tries to get used to wearing all black and never dancing. There they meet Rhett Butler for the first time. Soon Scarlett realizes shes pregrant with her dead husbands baby. Scarlett has the baby fine with no troubles. The Southern army passes through Atlanta and Ashley visits Scarlett and Melanie. Melanie gets pregnant. Nine months pass by and Melanie is deathly ill and is going to have the baby shortly. Siege is laid on Atlanta while the baby is near coming. Scarlett is forced to deliver the baby for all the doctors were busy with wounded soldiers. Scarlett takes charge and Melanie, Scarlett, Beau(The newborn), and Scarlett's child all flee to Tara. After a ravaging journey Scarlett makes it safely. After Scarlett sets up Tara to running again her and Melanie go to Atlanta once more. Ashley returns and Scarlett decides to marry her sister's bethrothed, Frank Kennedy, for his money. She uses his money to keep Tara running and she starts her own Lumber mill, something unheard of before this time, a woman working was taboo. Her husband and Ashley go to a Klu Klux Klan meeting and Ashley gets shot and Frank dies by a bullet to his head. Rhett goes and gets Ashley and saves him from the Northern army by pretending that Ashley had been visiting Belle Watlings house of 'ill repute'. Rhett proposes to Scarlett and they visit New Orleans and many places. Scarlett is happy. Then she has a baby girl who Rhett dotes on. Scarlett and Rhett fight a lot over silly things and then Rhett lets the girl jump with her horse and she falls, breaks her neck, and dies instantly. Rhett and Scarlett fight and Rhett comes home drunk one night and they have a few 'passionate' moments and Rhett leaves for good. He comes back and Scarlett tells him shes pregnant. He says rude things and she lunges for him, misses and falls down some stairs. She has a miscarriage and Rhett leaves with his famous line. \"Frankly my dear, I dont give a damn,\".",
            "Everyone knows this story, even without reading the book so I thought I'd add a bit about Mitchell's racist attitude towards the slaves. There are conversations amongst Scarlett and her family/friends regarding the Northern's erroneous assumptions about their slaves. They claim that they would never beat their slaves nor know of anyone that would behave that way. Of course we know that slaves were abused but there is huge denial here. Mitchell's characters also portray the slaves as child like, and the owners justify slavery saying that the Negroes are too child like to take care of themselves. Also remember that the men in Scarlett's lives are part of the KKK. Mitchell sees the group as Southerners protecting their family.It's astounding how much of this attitude is not commented upon. We could all learn that Mitchell's attitude is the type of thinking that people used to justify slavery and the treatment of Blacks after they were freed.Of course the novel itself is full of compelling characters, even if it is at heart a soap opera. Scarlett and Rhett are drawn so deeply that they feel that you would know them if you encountered them. By all means read the novel, but don't dismiss the racism.",
            "Margaret Mitchell may have only written one book, but she well deserved the awards she won and the praises bestowed upon her. I have read this book twice and was taken aback both times by her colorful yet brutally honest account of the Civil War, mixed with her artful and often humorous accounts of emotion and the social expectations of the period. This book is truly an \"objet d'art\", a wonderfully sculpted work, that is ageless and timeless. It takes one's breath away with its mix of humor and brutality; its insight of human behavior, propriety, pride, vanity, and patriotism. This book, and the part of her soul (a great part, I may add), will never die.",
            "On the one hand, Gone with the Wind is a wonderful novel. Scarlett O'Hara is probably one of the best female characters I've ever read in a classic novel. She is not nice. She is not good. And yet, the most interesting characters rarely are. Melanie Hamilton Wilkes and Ellen Rollibard O'Hara were wonderful women, but the point of Scarlett is she will never be that woman. She's resourceful. She's \"a scoundrel.\" When the women of the South are thrown out of their comfortable lives Scarlett claws her way back to the top - and doesn't learn until the very end that she lost everyone for it. Her determination is her greatest asset and her biggest tragedy. But at the end, when she has lost everything, she decides to keep going as always.On that same hand, it's a wonderful story. The five parts are set up like a Shakespearean Play. Margaret Mitchell, for all her faults, is a wonderful writer and her descriptions put you in the story. She's also an intelligent enough writer to be able to write from the viewpoint of many different people, even if she mostly sticks with Scarlett's point of view.But on the other hand, the descriptions of slavery are offensive. While I believe that there were probably some benevolent plantation owners and some slaves that wanted to stay with their families (although, in the novel, it's interesting that the \"house\" slaves - the ones who lived with the family day by day and recieved many more privilages - are the only ones who care to stay while the field hands leave as soon as possible), slavery was indeed a horrible institution. And the novel does seem to argue that it was all better before with slavery (although the North gets the brunt of the blame for wrecking things - even though the South are blamed for starting it). Also, some of the heroes of the novel are Klan members, and the only criticism of their choice is that it's \"too dangerous\" and \"not the way to get things done.\"As offensive as these thoughts may be to modern sensibilites, the novel still remains a great work of art. I resisted reading this book for a long time, but now I'm glad I did. For all its faults, I highly recommend it.",
            "Ok, wow! What a great book! I first saw &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; on a classic movie channel, and now I've read the book. If you buy it, you will not put it down - I mean I read 1041 pages in 3 days! This book will make you cry, for Rhett and Scarlett and is the best book I've ever read. It will make you cry so much, and personally, I really disliked Ashley for leading Scarlett on. This book is NOT racist, and it will give you a sense of romance better than Titanic ever could! The book describes Rhett's eyes, and make him come to life soooo much, and at the end it's sooo sad. Which is why I'm going to buy the sequel! Beware it leaves you hanging. Possibly the best book ever written EVER! BUY IT!",
            "Margaret Mitchell's classic may be an historical novel, but it is packed with the truth of what was done to a peaceful and blameless section of our Country. Most people do not realize the huge numbers of Europeans (unsuccessful in their Revolutions of 1848)who came to this Country, were given enlistment bonuses (when fresh from the boat) and allowed to wreak havoc on a people whom they held responsible for all of their miserable conditions. Mrs. Mitchell weaves an excellent story, filled with characters who are relevent, even in today's world, while utilizing, as a backdrop, one of the world's greatest tradgedies. It is obvious that Mrs. Mitchell used a large number of primary sources in writing her book, and it deserves to be placed at the top of every literate person's reading list.",
            "I purchased this as an ebook as I already own a 1936 copy of the book and a hardback copy for reading.Gone With the Wind is a timeless classic that I have read probably a dozen times. I never tire of the story and the author is amazingly descriptive. This is not your typical love story and it leaves you wanting more.",
            "I absolutley LOVE this book. It is not only the precedence setter for Historical Fiction, but it also paved the way for women writers to be recognized.Margaret Mitchell took a great many chances on the situations, characters, and \"scandals\" presented in this epic story of the Old South.It is the standard upon which all modern literary historical-romance fiction books are based.Good strong characters (many who were not even mentioned in the movie), and a story that is perfect for any season to read.Go ahead...buy the book in Hardback. This book accompanied me to war in the Middle East, and from its characters, I have continually found \"something new\". While you are at it..go ahead and purchase Donald McCraig's Rhett Butler's People. Make sure you read Gone with the Wind first, then set your engine speed on high...you are about to go into overdrive!",

            "About twenty years ago, when I was a teenager, I read this book, here in Brazil.Today, I don't like to read any kind of fiction, but remembering what I thought then, I have to give four stars for it.Another american author of fiction, Sidney Sheldon was nothing, compared to the american woman that wrote this book.Good, but too long, fiction.Good art doesn't gets older.",
            "It took a long time to read, but it was very good. Unfortunately, there are certain parts that I do not recommend in it that are a little inappropriete (between Rhett and Scarlett). Margaret Mitchell portrayed a beautiful story in this book though! :)",
            "Gone with the wind is the best book i have ever read!! It was so awesome!! Its my favorite book ever!!",
            "GONE WITH THE WIND is an excellent novel for a first time novelist, despite its many flaws. Scarlett O'Hara is one of the most memorable characters in literary history and Miss Mitchell's description of the Civil War years in Georgia is well-paced and exciting. Unfortunately, the second half of the book does not live up to the promise of the first. The pace is not as swift and Miss Mitchell's description of Reconstruction is a tad one-sided (though understandably so). The novel's main weaknesses seem to be Scarlett's long-running infatuation for Ashley Wilkes. Given their characters and Scarlett's acquaintance of Rhett Butler, this infatuation borders on the realms of disbelief. Another weakness of the book is the lack of thorough editing. In Part One, Miss Mitchell nearly devoted an entire chapter on the Tarleton family, who happened to be secondary characters. Other than that, Miss Mitchell did an excellent job. It seemed a shame that she did not continue her writing career.",
            "This book has a very involving story and I quite literally could not put it down, though I did a few times in outrage over the portrayal of slavery, the Civil War, and the Reconstruction. This novel exemplifies the Lost Cause movement, which showed the Confederacy as noble but outnumbered, and slavery as a benign and paternal institution. It is worth reading for the story, but I shudder to think that some may take what it states as fact. I am not saying that the book should be banned or censored, but it is certainly difficult to read the numerous descriptions of freedmen as lazy and the countless explanations that slaves were just so dumb that they needed the care of white people.Also, Scarlett O'Hara is a terribly unlikeable character. Whether she is stealing her sister's boyfriend or daydreaming about murdering her only true friend, Ashley, her actions and thoughts will just appall you. She is also phenomenally oblivious, not realizing that Rhett loves her until it is far too late. I was sad that Rhett left her, but who could blame him??",
            "Great Classic, an awesome book. A must have for all who love reading. I really recommend it. I'm still reading, it has over 1000 pages, also a true gift for those who love old stories like me.",
            "THIS IS THE GREATEST BOOK EVER!!!!!!!oh my godI have read gone with the wind sooo many times and im not a book person. it's soo fantastic but when ever i re-read it i can't even finish it because i get so sad. Scarlett O'hara is the best fictional character ever.",
            "This is an incredible book. The story is enthralling, the grammar superb... whether you like adventure, romance, or historical fiction, this is the book for you! And the price is a bargain!",
            "I first read this book in fifth grade, for a reading contest. Since then I reread it about every other year. Mitchell takes me into a whole different world with her story of Scarlett and Rhett, Melanie and Ashley. I love it!",
            "I only knew the story from the movie, so I bought this book the week before we invaded Iraq, I'm sure at some subconscious level to read a viewpoint about war. The first half of the book was ok, I liked the descriptions of the suffocating constraints of upper class society at the time and Scarlett's rejection of them. The devastation of war and the struggle that Scarlett and her family went through were powerful. However, the second half of the book completely turned me off to the story. Margret Mitchell's descriptions of the reconstruction were so vile I almost put the book down. Blacks were only happy being slaves, they were too stupid for anything else. The only good blacks in the book are the ones who can serve the whites. Big Sam says he had enough of freedom and wants to go back to Tara. He's even incredulous that while in the north whites wanted him to sit at the dinner table with them like he was their equal, but he couldn't do it because he is not the equal to whites. Mitchell actually says that he smiles and feels better when Scarlett starts to tell him what to do because someone is telling him what to do again. Mitchell also uses animal metaphors when describing the black characters.At one point Mitchell is describing how the southern whites hate the Yankees so much because the Yankees have money and food and power and they do not, yet she doesn't have any sense of irony to see that the whites are in the position that they put the slaves in for centuries.And another thing that I did not like about the book is that most of the characters are serious sociopaths. They kill anyone who breaks their rules of racial propriety. Rhett kills a black man for being \"upity\" to a white woman, another character, one of the Fontaine boys, kills a black man for for saying something to a white woman. We are not told what but it is pretty obvious it was sexual, so we have the sterotype of the black male sexual prowler. Then the same Fontaine boy kills Jonas Wilkinson for telling black men that they are equal to whites and that they are alowed to have white women!! He doesn't just kill him, he cuts him to ribbons with a knife. There are many more examples of this psychotic behaviour. And Mitchell treats these behaviors as if they are to be admired. While reading I kept thinking these people are all nuts. I was glad they suffered and I'm glad they lost the war. I lost any sense of caring about what happened to any of them, including Scarlett.Also, this is a very anti-American book. Mitchell keeps going on about how awful the Yankees and the Union and the federal government are and how great Georgia and states rights are. Of course, states rights here means being able to murder anyone who annoys you. The reconstruction section of the book should be read by everyone just to show why the flying of the Confederate flag is so offensive. It is completely un-American.And one last thing. This isn't a great love story. Rhett is really only a supporting character in the book until the last 200 pages when they get married, and for a book over 1000 pages, that's not alot. I think people remember the movie more than the actual book.I was really dissapointed with this book. I was looking forward to enjoying a nice read and discovered that it was horrible propaganda. It is really hard to believe that this book won the Pulitzer prize over Absalom,Absalom! by Faulkner.",
            "Gone With the Wind was written by Margaret Mitchell and was published in 1936. This book is mainly about the difficult times for Scarlett O'Hara. The book was focused around the era of the Civil War. Gone With the Wind is a romance story about Scarlett O'Hara,her love of her homeland, Tara, and her search for love. She was jealous of Melanie Wilkes who married her cousin, Ashley, whom Scarlett desired. In the rage of Ashley marrying Melanie, Scarlett marries the first man who asks her, Melanie's brother Charles. Within 2 months Charles dies in the Civil War leaving her with a baby. She desperately tries to win over Ashley by moving in with Melanie and Melanie's aunt after Charles died. When Scarlett becomes bored with her living conditions, she goes to a fundraiser and meets Rhett Butler, a wealthy man from Georgia and he falls in love with her. But Rhett is very annoyed with the fact that Scarlett is in love with Ashley. Then tragedies start when the Civil War comes close to Georgia and Atlanta. Melanie gets pregnant and Ashley goes to war because Atlanta is attacked. Scarlett would have to escape back home to Tara before the Yankees come. Scarlett, along with her son Wade, her servant Prissy, Melanie, and Melanie's son Beau travel to the plantation Tara, where Scarlett was born, and Scarlett finds no food, no animals, only 2 remaining servants, a dead mother, an insane father, and 2 sick sisters. In desperation to survive, Scarlett marries Rhet Butler, and has a baby girl named Ella. She realizes too late that Rhett is her true love, but Rhett is tired of being second to Ashley, and leaves Scarlett. She decides she wants to get Rhett back, and then says \"I won't think about that today, I'll think about that tomorrow. After all, tomorrow is another day.\" I enjoyed the book a lot, and would recommend it to anyone who has a lot of time, and likes to read love stories. It was long, but the author, Margaret Mitchell told the story of the civil war very detailed and colorful, and had a way with her words to make ever page enjoyable, and memorable.",
            "I was a little disappointed with this hyped-up book. Melly was all good and Scarlett all bad. This plot is good, but I think Margaret Mitchell did not develop the characters as much as she could have. Humans are not either good or bad, everyone has a bit of both in them. However, I could not put it down, and it is such an epic story of American history that I would recommend it, just don't expect it to be as great as it is said to be.",
            "Atlanta belle, Scarlett O'hara ,deals with the impacts of the Civil War and the reconstruction of the south. Scarlett is a feminist, driven to extremes to ensure her future well-being and wealth; she is selfish and egotistical, but admirable in her stubbornness. This book is an epic, starting at secession and ending during reconstruction with carpetbaggers and scalawags stripping the south of its feudal past. The book is to some extent racist and revisionist southern pride. Was this Margarett Mitchell's interpretation of how southern's themselves feel in the 20th century, or does she truly believe that slaves were relatively happy as prisoners on a plantation? This book is heavy on the romance and light on the history, making it an average book",

            "The book is better than the movie, and might be worth reading if you need an immense tome to take on vacation. Much as I despise this silly book, I have to admit it is a prime page turner.Its chief interest as a book is as a window into the viewpoint of history so common in the white upper crust South in the 1930's. The casually racist attitudes of Margaret Mitchell are a good example, and enough to make any quasi-enlightened being howl with outrage. Ditto the views on Andersonville, Reconstruction and especially the benefits of slavery to Black people.",
            "Well, I think Margaret Mitchell could have used a realy good editor. I don't mind reading long books quite the contrary I assure you, but well, one tiers of hearing yet another story about Scarlett doing something or another that gets her scorned by the people so they gossipe and Melly has to stop them. One time is enough!The story line for those few people who do not know it is the following: The young Scarlett O'Hara who is the favorit of all men falls in love with her friend Ashely Wilks who marries his cousin Melanie (Melly). Scarlett wants to hurt Ashley so she marrys his brother who soon after they are married dies in the war. Then Scarlett earns the scorne of the populus of Atlanta with her scandales behavior.Melly has a painfull childbirth and Scarlett takes her to Tara (her home) as the Yankkees march into Atlanta Georga. To Melly this kind act of careing for her wins her undieing respect.The story continues from here but I will not. The rest of the book centers around Scarlett and Rhett Butler and their feelings towareds eachother.I do not want to give the wronge impression it is not a bad book or even a book I disliked, it was great to read on the nine hour plane flight fom Budapest, but, after the plane ride was over and I still had 300 pages left I felt like I was wadding through quick sand to fininsh. If I had been on the plane for about 2 and a half more hours I would not feel this way but back home where I had so many other book to read I began to look at it as a waste of time. I am glad however that I have read it. Though I would have certenly looked at it in a more appeling light had it been hacked down about 300 pages.",
            "Ok, so I'll say it. I hated the movie Gone with the Wind. But, in an effort to be fair, I decided to read the book. I thought maybe it was something about the production that I didn't like. But, no, the book has many of the same problems.Reasons to Hate GWTW:1)It's endless for one, just like the movie. Over a thousand pages and a large bit of it is completely unecessary.2) Rhett - I don't care what anyone says, he wasn't handsome, he wasn't romantic, and there wasn't much to like about him.3) Scarlett - I've never seen a more annoying female lead. And everyone says, \"oh she grows up in the end! she stops being selfish!\" She doesn't.4) If you don't like the two main characters, what's the point?Needless to say, it was a waste of money for me and I gave my copy to a friend who loves the movie. At least she'll enjoy it.",
            "It was a very well written book but everyone told me this was a good romance book. It was not a romance book, a romance book is a book where both people love each other. Rhett loved Scarlett for most of the book, but Scarlett did not love Rhett so how was this romance?It was very good other than that though, I had trouble putting it down just to go to sleep. It is very well written and unlike some authors she actually puts in a lot of description.",
            "GONE WITH THE WIND is a book that deserved to win the Pulitzer prize for its well developed Characters and fine writing but PLEASE don't buy it as history.I see no reason to call the Atlanta citizens &quot;rare courage&quot; unless you mean half baked!The slaves -- yes for what they endured.The Union troops (Black and White) fighting to preserve the Union IN FREEDOM and President Lincoln who went through hell for the nation but NOT the Confederates who were only seeking their own advantage and trying to tear our nation apart to establish a slave empire.Sorry but facts are facts.",

I'm passing itdown to family who I hope will make this a keepsake.thanks. katie",

I finally sat down to read the book and while it took me a loooong time to finish it, I couldn't put it down. I see now why this book is so controversial, even today still. I love how things that didn't make sense, or you just wanted more of, in the movie went more into detail in the book. Melly dying, the chaos that Rhett and Scarlett went though when Bonnie died, how Scarlett landed Frank. Very good book indeed!",
            "this is a great book and I am enjoying every page. I read the book many years ago but it is worth reading again very nice to read on a kindle",
            "This has always been a favourite of mine, The more I read it, the more depth I see in the characters; their flaws as well as their strengths.",

            "I gave it 5 stars because the shipment was fast and the book itself was really good. I disliked nothing about the book.",
            "I bought this book for my wife, and as usual, it arrived on time and in great shape. No problems. As usual, 4 Stars because only God is Perfect.",
            "Only just started this book, but know what it's all about. Will enjoy it I am sure as I read on.",
            "Mitchell combined love and war the way no other writer could have done it. The romance between Scarlett and Rhett left readers clinging to every word spoken between the two. In the midst of their world falling apart, Phett still had a passion for Scarlett, and Scarlett for Ashley. However, she never tells whether or not Scarlett ever gets Rhett in the end.",
            "Gone With the Wind is, obviously, my favorite book ever, but I truly believe it is one of the best ever written. I read this book when I was 12 years old, and I finished it in four days. I was so entirely engrossed in the setting, characters, and plot that I could honestly, literally just NOT put it down.Although the issue of which I am about to address did not bother or offend me in the least, however I am not racist or pro-slavery, I will talk about this in hope of enlightening a few more people and maybe helping to share the magic of GWTW. Sure, there are some things relating to racism, and of course to slavery, but I don't see why people are so offended by this. Yes, racism is wrong, and the way some slave owners treated their slaves, and how whites treated blacks, was absolutely horrifying, but, this is only a book. Slavery has long since been abolished and racism is now, thankfully, dwindling to almost nothing.At first, I'll admit, I was not fond of Scarlett, but after a while, I became used to her ways, and I really became absorbed into the book and felt as though I was walking in her shoes, and I understand why she did some things she did. The character development in this book is amazing; so is the extensive description.Gone With the Wind is such an amazing book for many reasons, but for me it has to be the ability which Mitchell has to take her readers into the story as though they were living the events themselves. I also loved the desperation and want Scarlett felt for Rhett as she realized she truly loved him, and of course, their stubborn relationship before they were married.There is not much more I can say that hasn't been said, except this: for hopeless romantics and avid readers (of which I am both), you will surely love GWTW. For everyone else: keep an open mind while you read. Remember that times have changed drastically and try to imagine if you were Scarlett yourself. Also, dive in the culture in which this book was written. Even if you don't agree with it, I believe everyone deserves an enjoyable read from of Gone With the Wind.",
            "Imagine that in a flurry, your old life disappears; what was once poverty and happiness has transformed into poverty and a new, bittersweet lifestyle. Welcome to Scarlett O'Hara's corrupted world, where what once seemed improper is now necessary to survive. I thought this book brilliantly combined romance, adventure, and non-fiction information based on the southern aspect of the Civil War.",
            "I READ THIS BOOK AT ABOUT THE AGE OF 14. IT WAS THE FIRST BOOK ,EVEN AT THE LENGTH IT IS, THAT I DIDN'T WANT TO END! I SO MUCH WANTED THE CHARACTERS TO CONTINUE! WHEN I FINALLY SAW THE MOVIE YEARS LATER-IT WAS MORE THAN I COULD HAVE ASKED FOR. IT WAS ABOUT THAT TIME THAT I FELL IN LOVE WITH CLARK GABLE! I FEEL THAT THIS BOOK WAS THE ORIGINAL HISTORICAL ROMANCE NOVEL, AND THAT EVERYTHING ELSE PALES IN COMPARISON!",
            "I must have read this book umpteen number of times and i find the characters of Scarlet and Rhett ever evolving .If u are a die hard romantic who believes in fighting for your dreams then this book is a must ...",
            "This book is quite fair, not exactly the best, but good enough. I thought it should be a very challenging book but I was disappointed...I read it last year (13 yr old) and was astonished on how easy the vocabulary is and how easy it is to read this book.As for the story...it's pretty good. I really like those historical novels, and the writing and descrbtion is wonderful... but some parts of the story is a drag.",
            "I love this book, I've read about 6 or 7 times at least. It's fun reading about someone more: clueless, and selfish than me.",
            "First of all: I adored the movie. I fell in love with Gable and with Leigh at the same time. Everyone could see that they were made for each other. I mainly expected a romantic love story when I started to read the novel. Yet it was nowhere to be found though a lot of reviewers seem to have seen what I obviously could not see.The first shock was that Scarlett is apparently only sixteen when she first meets Rhett, aged thirty-three, an already middle-aged, sophisticated man who chases after an incredibly shallow and vain teenager with much more gumption than wit. Scarlett is so emotionally immature and ignorant that it borders on blatant stupidity. I usually love it when the heroes indulge in verbal duels but those in this book I could not enjoy for Scarlett always looks foolish in them. To make it worse she is as cold as a fish, extremely childish and calculating. The authoress referred to her charm, intelligence and allure more than once but I couldn't see any of it except her beauty of course and that she was hard to get. She could be Becky Sharp's little sister but at least Thackeray's lady possessed intellect, a good judgment for people and a great sense of humor. To be fair I have to say that the heroine is resilient and smart when it comes to business. She also isn't afraid of hard work though exactly those only likeable traits make her suspicious to the good people of Atlanta. Yet Rhett was hardly a Harlequin hero either. Unlike his movie character he is bitingly sarcastic and acidly derisive instead of charming, amusing and witty. I found him considerably more sinister than Gable. He is violent, unreliable and really ruthless in a menacing way. With very good reason men usually don't like him. The way he is portrayed I couldn't like him either. I had no clue if Rhett loved Scarlett or not and if he did, why? Her reactions remained equally enigmatic in the novel. The book was surely a fascinating read for a lot of reasons but it made me unhappy in an unpleasant way. The characters often treat each other in such a hateful and cruel way that it was painful to watch. Whatever kind of love those two felt for each other, tenderness and true concern for the other seemed to have been no part in it. For fans of true romance I cannot recommend this book.",
            "Yes, it is a magnificent novel, an American classic. Filled with larger than life characters Gone with the Wind takes the reader to a chapter of American history not readily remembered (Southern Reconstruction) and to institutions we wish we could not remember (slavery, racism and the KKK).Lets talk about the novel. It is not a book for the faint of heart- my edition is over 700 pages. Yet, Margaret Mitchell has the gift to immerse you in a world that has long since passed. From the comfort of our armchairs it is difficult for us to imagine the sense of lostness the southern gentry must of felt during and after the war. They simply lost everything. Yet, there is something about the American character that does not want to give up, a stubbornness best personified by Scarlet O'Hara.I first read Gone with The Wind in the early 90's, it left an indelible imprint on my mind. About a year ago as I was persuing my library, it caught my eye again. I pull it for the self, sat down in my wing back chair and began reading eagerly anticipating being drawn into Mitchell's south once again. This time, however, I could not finish the book. A few hundred pages into it, I gently closed the cover and put it back into my library. What was it that caused me not complete this book? It was the blatant racism that seemed to permeate every other page.Yes, I realize that this book was written by a southerner reflecting a time and culture long since gone. Yes, racism is an appropriate subject to write about. Yes, one may write a novel that reflect the racism of the antebellum south- but this is one country preacher who will not read it again.",
            "Really, that's my only gripe. Too many pages and all that dialogue and long paragraphs with Mammy and Prissy and all the others talking so strangely. I blame it on Margaret Mitchell!But despite the length (1,037 pages) and overbearing dialogue, I found the book to be very enjoyable. It took me a whole year to read this damn thing, but at least I finally finished! And I am not going to read SCARLETT or THE WIND DONE GONE!Anyways, I loved the movie especially! Vivien Leigh is hot and gorgeous! Gable is Gable, classy and smug! I have the tape at home as part of my Best Picture collection. The movie is also long, at nearly 4 hours! But in the end, Mitchell did a good job. Alice Randall and Alexandra Ripley should be ashamed of themselves for thinking they could do better! HA!Pretty good reading, as long as nothing interferes with it. I found myself putting the damn thing away and leaving it for months on end. Thanks to my job with those bastards at the UF Foundation, I got a chance to get through it!I am the man!",
            "I was feverently reading a key scene between Rhett and Scarlett last night and when I got to page 713 - there WAS not 713. It was page 813!! Uggh! What a bummer. Great story, one of the best I've ever read, but that missing page really breaks up the flow. Buy a different version!",
            "GWTW is a classic, undoubtedly - sweeping, romantic, colorful, well written, all of that. I have read it so many times and seen the movie enough to recite it word for word, loved swashbuckling Captain Butler and plucky, selfish Scarlett for all that she is, a woman of her own worth during times when women were showpieces more than anything else. And i absolutely love the descriptions of the civil war background - it is sweeping, historically accurate and touching, many times. I can slip the movie in at any scene or pick up the book and spend a few hours undisturbed just lost in its language and flow.All of that said, i think it is important not to forget that Mitchell has not mentioned one word against slavery in the 800+ pages she penned, slavery being the burning, heart rending issue of the time the novel was set. Every country and state goes through change, for good or bad and we lose times that were precious, sentimental, valuable - or we lose a 'land of grace and plenty' as she calls pre war Georgia. But we also gain causes that are worth it in terms of human reslience and courage and value/respect for others. Looking at it that way the novel comes across like a victorian painting - pretty and appealing but lacking in soul.",
            "People read the book and leave all the politics aside if you're going to read this book. Enjoy it and remember this book was written in the 1930's. Very different way of thinking back then. I have read some of the reviews and I just threw my hands in the air and decided to write my review. That is how mad I got. Why? Well, everytime someone decides to write a review about a book that took place during the civil war someone has to put in there two cents, about how horrible the whites treated the slaves or how horrible slavery was. Please. Okay, yes slavery did happen. And I don't conden it niether. But everyday one can not escape not listening to it about the subject on t.v.(especially the Oprah show, I really think that lady spends her life talking about the subject, bitter woman, or movies, or songs, ect. ect. ect. From all I have read and seen and learned does one really believe all the plantation owners beat there slaves and killed them? I mean would a plantation owner who paid top dollar for a slave just take him home and starve him, beat him, and have chained him and just treat him worse than a dog. I don't think so. It just not possible that all plantation owners did that. If that really was widespread as we are lead to believe then now, then there would have been an uprising of slaves sooner then Civil War. There would not have been any need for a Civil War if all the whites of the South then were the cruel vicious monster we have been lead to believe they were. As allways when we have a small majorit of people to tell us history (that is t.v., roots, and all them bad history channels, and magazines and supposely non-fiction books that are written with the liberal mentality), they just re-write history. If one really wants to find out the history of the south. READ OLD BOOKS ON HISTORY!!! NOT THE NEW ONES!!! OLD BOOKS!!! WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT HISTORY IT HAS ALL BEEN RE-WRITTEN!!! Whew! I feel better now.Oh by the way. This is from a Hispanic telling you this.So if you really want to enjoy this book. Enjoy reading Scarlett scandals and her fight to never be hungry again. Enjoy her trying ever art she knows to take that poor excuse of a man Ashley away from the every loyal Melanie. Enjoy Scarlett when she tries to figure out Rhett and why she just cannot get it through her thick bull-headed head that she always has been in love him.",
            "Like it or not-- and there are PLENTY of reasons not to like GWTW-- this book earns its status as a classic. It reminded me of Anna Karenina: well-written, brilliant &amp; deliciously soapy plot, and ultimately depressing. In the end, I was fed up with Rhett &amp; Scarlett, but I still cried for them.As a northerner living in the south, I got a new appreciation for/insight into the rich history of white southerners, but good luck finding any insight into the world of black southerners. True, Mitchell was a product of her times and one needs to allow for that, but she says some HORRIBLY insensitive things about black people.If you read this book, keep it in context. Remember that it is only one part of history, only one book, somewhere in the middle of truth and lies and legend.P.S.-- Zora Neale Hurston's &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot; would be an interesting book to read afterwards, especially if you need to restore your faith in true love.",
            "Haven't finished yet (300 pages left) but I'm loving this book... nothing horribly suspenseful happens yet I can't put it down. It's also easy to read- I never find myself thinking, &#34;Okay, let's get on with it&#34; as most people expect to do from books of this time period. It's very long (1037 pages) but don't let that deter you!",
            "This could/should be the book required in high school on the American Civil War and Reconstruction. It's also a romantic novel from a female's perspective, which is an interesting twist on a genre that traditionally has male heroes.",
            "When I first read Gone with the wind many years ago at age 25, I had watched the movie many times and loved it. Then when I read the book, I fell in love with it hailing it as the best book I'd ever read in my life. At that time though, I did find the in depth descriptions of the surroundings and of backgrounds of people a little tedious. Other than that, I loved it and my lifelong love of Civil War history was started right then and there. As the years went by and I read so many more books, a few years ago there began to be other books that took the title of \"best book\" in my eyes, always keeping that great love of GWTW in my heart. However, at age 52, I decided to read it again. It just called to me for some reason. This time, I loved it even so much more than I did then, and what I disliked about it years ago, the descriptive writing of Margaret Mitchell, is one of the things I loved about it most of all. It takes a tremendous amount of talent for a writer to totally immerse the reader into the setting they have created, when they can just see the lush beauty, the red clay, the desolation, the dying wounded, everything that was written, you lived it, smelled it, and felt it. I was in this story from beginning to end, and I lost myself in it completely. It now has rightfully taken its place as my favorite book of all time.Yes, It is a book where the main character is a selfish, spoiled rich plantation owner's daughter, that lost everything she had that she knew in the world, her home, her parents, many friends, her money, and how she clawed herself back to the top no matter who she ran over or hurt along the way. She is an unlikeable character that you cannot help but like anyway for the sheer will and determination she has to survive. Somewhere along that road of selfishness, she developed a conscience even though she stifled it whenever it reared it's head and went on being ruthless anyway. Also somewhere along the road, she realized that there was a feeling she could not quite identify in her heart about Melanie and Rhett, a feeling she did not realize was love until it was too late to enjoy that love. Oh you knew she was ruthless and hard, but you knew there was some good in her somewhere (was there?) and you rooted for her.Then there's Rhett. The rebellious, sarcastic, making money at the ruin of others, handsome man that fell in love with her the moment he cast eyes upon her. He was there for her so many times over the years, but she never really appreciated him. He loved her so much, but never let on in words that he did because he knew anyone that admitted they loved her, she would run over like she did so many other poor men that loved her, may they rest in peace. She realized she loved him much too late.There's Melanie, the mild, sweet shy girl-like woman who Scarlett said she hated because she was Ashley's wife (and of course Scarlett was in love with Ashley). So sweet and mild, she has a fierce loyalty and love for Scarlett, which Scarlett also didn't fully realize until it was too late.And Ashley, poor pitiful Ashley who she just thought she loved all these years only to finally realize she was In love with an idea of him, not him. She wasted all those years not realizing this, again, until it was too late.Mixing with all these wonderful characters and more, is a story about the south and how the world they knew was lost. Though it was a world that had many wrongs that should not have happened and that I'm glad was put an end, you can't help but feel their loss, feel the horror as they watched their houses and Atlanta burn to the ground. You feel their hungriness as they have nothing to eat, feel their shame as they have nothing but rags left to wear, feel their bitterness as they are under Yankee rule during the reconstruction.It's also a story about what different people do to survive. In this case, does one go with the flow and make the best out of a new situation and reap the benefits that they can in the situation they're in, or does one stay loyal to a cause that was burned to the ground and is no more and stay humbled and hungry? Does one sell their soul and prosper at the cost of others? Scarlett took advantage of the situation she was in and it made no difference who she ran over to do it or if she did forget the cause for which a war was fought. However, in the end, I think she realized that to have all she acquired, a very high price was paid for it all.This book was so great on so many levels, even more that what I've written here. For to go on, it would be way longer that this. I think it's a masterpiece.I do want to say one more thing, last but not least, about the author Margaret Mitchell. Though this was her only published novel, she did not drop down out of the sky to write this book out of nowhere. Growing up she wrote complete stories all the time as a little girl, was in drama at school, and as a young adult, worked as a journalist until she had to quit due to an ankle injury. She was born into a family rich in civil war history and many of her family had actually fought and lived during the civil war and she sat on many a lap listening to these stories throughout her childhood. She was born, lived and died in the city she wrote about, Atlanta. She knew of what she wrote about and it's historically accurate. She died, unfortunately, at the age of 48, hit by a drunk driver, crossing Peachtree St. (a street mentioned many times in the book), with her husband on the way to the movies. 5 days later she died, she was buried in Oakland Cemetary, (a graveyard mentioned in the book). To me, this book could have never been surpassed and I feel so good knowing that in her short life, she chose to leave this masterpiece for us all to enjoy forever. I, for one, am grateful. Thank you Margaret Mitchell.",
            "I have to say, at about 60-80 pages in, I was tempted to give up on this monstrous, 1000+ beast of a book, but Ifm glad I didnft. I have this strange compulsion to ALWAYS finish books, despite how bad they are in the beginning, in the hopes they get better. And this one certainly did.I wonft spend much time on plot, because truthfully, the only people that arenft aware of the basic plot of this book are those of you who were like me and obviously living under the largest rock in the world. Ifd like to start, instead, with Scarlett.Scarlett happens to be the most reprehensible, vile, and childish character Ifve ever encountered. And I love her. No matter how foolish I thought she was, I always wanted to read on to see what happened to her. I think this is where Mitchell really did something really wonderful. It is almost impossible to have complete disgust in a character and still want to know what her ending is. This is how I felt about Scarlett. I wanted to shake her until she developed some semblance of sense, but I then realized that this book has a sense of a bildungsroman to it. Yes, it is about life during the Civil War, and about romance, and many other things, but itfs mainly about Scarlett and her journey to womanhood. In my personal opinion, the interesting part is that she never really reaches that womanhood, despite all her hardships.I am not one for historical fiction. I will admit that I like historical war fiction even less. But although the novel is set during the time of the Civil War, and there are excerpts of the battles in it, I wasnft overwhelmed enough by it to dislike it. It was vaguely interesting to me, and didnft take away from the main story.I also wouldnft call this a romance, because, for all intents and purposes, Scarlett is never in love with anyone. She appears to be in love with Ashley throughout the entire book, and despite the many comments I may receive about this, I truthfully donft think she was ever in love with Rhett. I think she was in love with the idea of both of these men. The only person Scarlett is in love with is herself. And the only thing she is in love with is money. Which brings me to my next point: Mitchell took a huge risk making Scarlett the woman she did.Scarlett become a strong, independent, although still childish, woman. Her only gfallh is that she realizes she glovesh Rhett too late in the game, and has to (presumably) spend her life wanting him and never fully having him. Generally, when women of the 1800s are fictionalized as strong and independent, there are seriously negative connotations associated with them. You see this some with Scarlett, but she doesnft let it affect her. She is all in all strong. Silly in many regards, but strong. This is where Mitchell, in my opinion, really broke the mold. She allowed her character to suffer through so much pain and heartache and yet let her continue as an unbroken woman. Scarlett doesnft appear to be marred by anything but her own agenda. And I absolutely respect that, even though I still think she needs a bit more sense.I have to give this one s s s s. I truly loved it, with the exception of the lack of a love story. I guess in my head, I had considered this the greatest romance of all time (and I honestly couldnft tell you where I got this misperception), and I really found that lacking. Other than that, I would recommend this book to anyone who even remotely enjoys reading.If you enjoyed this review, come read others at [...]!",

It takes a very good book to make me cry, but by the end of Gone With the Wind, I'm bawling my eyes out. I'm in a bad mood for days every time I read it because of the ending. It makes me so frusterated. I never thought a book could do that. As soon as I found out there was a sequel, I went to the library and read it. It may not be as good as Gone With the Wind (but then, what is?) but it gives a plausible answer to this phenomenal saga of the south.",
            "After seeing the movie, I just had to read the novel. Although parts vary from what they are in the movie, it doesn't at all take away from the magic in Margaret Mitchell's words. I see Scarlett as someone I would want to be be. A woman who's strong, beautiful, and vain... and gets away with it. Rhett Butler is the epitimy of what a man should be. He's romantic and keeps you wondering what he's going to do next. All of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler's trials and happy moments are what makes Gone With the Wind the classic that it is. Mitchell's way of describing the brave (but horrible) downfall of the South is extrodinary. Anyone who loves romance, wit, and adventure should definitely read Gone With the Wind!",

Margaret Mitchell has painted such an unforgettable character in Scarlett 'O'Hara that even after finishing the book ,u can't decide whether to despise her / admire her ... not once in the book ,does Scarlett think an unselfish thought -her motives are always totally selfish -either for herself / for Tara -her childhood home [ which in effect is because she loves it passioantely!} --- the way she twists men around her little finger even the worldly wise &amp; cynical Rhett Butler in the end --- the slow &amp; inevitable change from the coquettish &amp; beautiful 16 year old Southern Belle to the hard as nails &amp; embittered yet still beautiful woman --- her relationship with her angel-like sister-in-law whom she loves to hate but yet ultimately fails to --- her wild passion for Ashley that destroys her judgement where men are concerned &amp; nearly destroys her ---which when the mask finally falls is revealed as mere lust on his part &amp; infatuation on her part --- her unrecognised till its too late love for the charming yet crude Rhett --- Only Scarlett's self- absorption remains constant...! Margaret portrays all this so beautifully &amp; so vividly that u completely lose yourselves in the 'O 'Hara family &amp; their trials in the war ...&amp; Scarlett --- the girl with the world at her feet who goes through life refusing to be true to anyone but herself &amp; the woman she becomes so hardened by disillusionment &amp; poverty that she starts forgetting the feminine ways essential for a true lady in those times ... she lingers in your mind long after ...&amp; U can never really decide whether she got what she deserved/ deserved what she got...As a hugely popular classic ,it definitely lives up to its fame ...Certainly worth a read!",

            "It was a very descriptive book, the costumes, the characters, the scenery, all came to life. A true romance, and not excessive love-making on every page. Rhett and Scarlett were truely meant for each other, but she didn't know it. It's so true.",

            "This book has everything that is needed for a great work of literature. The characters are compelling and believable, the plot and setting are exciting, and the language is just flowery enough to set off the book nicely. Scarlett is a vivacious character, and although I don't really respect or admire her I think she has a monolithic personality. I am so different from her that I find her reactions to the various situations she encounters highly entertaining. My favorite character is Melanie, because she is so like me. I can believe what she says and does and understand her because I would do the same thing usually. Rhett Butler gets on my nerves, though I think he's supposed to. He switches between acting gentlemanly and being a scoundrel. He doesn't know how to treat a lady-- or rather, a woman who isn't exactly a lady. The other characters I don't pay as much attention to, but I enjoy reading about every one of them. One of my first reactions to this book was that it really is perfect for a movie. Some of the descriptions paint a detailed and beautiful picture in my mind, and I read parts of them over and over. I haven't quite finished the book yet, but I have already recommended it to most of my friends, and I shall think of it as one of the greatest-- if not the best-- books I have ever read.",

There are many sad events in the bood, but there are also some happy moments. This book is a must read!",

            "There is no excuse not to read this book. It is amazing and would be loved by all who read it.",
            "IT IS ONE OF THE MOST UNFORGETTABLE STORY I HAVE EVER READ . IT IS ONE STORY THAT IS HARD TO RESIST AND STOP READING . WHO CAN EVER EVER FORGET THE FIERY CHARACTER OF SCARLETT O'HARA AND THE COOL , DASHING SOLDIER OF FORTUNE , RHETT BUTLER AND THEIR UNUSUAL DEVELOPMENT OF LOVE ?",
            "Before I picked up this book, I read most of the reviews, but I knew better than to let the opinions of others influence me tremendously. And so, I read through 1000 pages of war, Southern society/conventions in the antebellum and reconstruction South, and of course, the tempestuous romance between Scarlett and Rhett.I was expecting a romance, but I cannot classify GWTW as romance, but rather as historical fiction. Margaret Mitchell writes with a voice that captivates, evokes emotion, but most of all, she brings the Civil War and its aftermath to life especially through Scarlett O'Hara. The destitution, plights, burdens, and silly notions/convictions of Scarlett's reflect the people of the time; it gives readers a glimpse of failure, poverty, and the desperation war leaves in its trail. This is why I enjoyed this novel-the sentiments, struggles, and even the uncharitable thoughts going through Scarlett's head allowed me to feel empathy and to relate. The ignorance, grief, desperation, painful repercussions, and hope that circulate throughout novel are artfully portrayed.As to the romance, it wasn't what I was hoping for, but it was realistic. Honestly, I didn't like a single character in the novel because none of them knew the true meaning of love, and if they did, they didn't know how to express it. Scarlett is comparable to a spoiled, pampered child who lives eternally in her bubble even after all her hardships; she sees but does not grasp and doesn't have the will to do so. However, her strength and courage are to be commmended because despite her beliefs, she does not fail herself or others when it truly matters. Rhett is a complete idiot and their disastrous marriage is partly his fault because he never fought for his love...just like his blase skeptical outlook on people and life, he let it all slide by because what he hoped for didn't turn out to be reality. He used the wrong approach and so the ends did not meet as it should have, and how he hurt in the process. Mellanie was just too nice and naive to really be human; I find it almost unbelievable at times to see how much faith she had in everyone. Just as Scarlett's selfish, ill-conceived thoughts never ceased to amaze me, Mellanie's belief in man's better nature was as tedious. She is however the most likeable character. Ashley is weak, pitiful and as Scarlett realizes, the type of man girls dream about, but not worthy of their idolatry because the disillusionment is not worth it. Despite having a hard time liking any of the selfish or selfless and infinitely unworthy characters, I must admit that the characterization was dynamic. I really wanted to slap Scarlett, Mellanie, Rhett, and Ashley at some point or other. And at the same time, my heart went out to them because I could understand why they did the things they did.GWTW is an entertaining read, unique to its kind (just like The Fountainhead), but I didn't find it magnificent or glorious. The novel is as bitter as it is uplifting and I couldn't find a balance between the two. Just a lot of tolerance for silly, selfish, careless creatures and pity for those who reach the \"aha\" moment when it is too late. Because it's so well-written though, I know for sure that it is not a novel I am going to forget (which is often the case) and I am very glad I forced myself to read it. It was definitely an experience.",
            "This book was published in 1936; in the ensuing seventy years, no one has even come close to topping it. Enough said.",
            "This book is definitely worth the read. Although long, Gone with the Wind by Margaret Mitchell has a lot going on in it. Mitchell develops the characters so well that you can almost see them. It is also great for history. This is because I always learned about the civil war through the northerners eyes. In this book you see it all through the eyes of a southerner. As the story progresses you build up more and more grudges against Scarlet, who is not your best friend. Scarlet is rude and takes on too \"manly\" duties. Close to the end, though, she finally gets kicked back. When hard times hit she becomes more sweet, gentle and womanly. However, that does not last long enough. When her marital status changes she regains money and again, she gives up her sweetness and goes back to her old self. This book would be good for those who enjoy romantic, historical and classic novels about the civil war. Stick with it through the slow parts and you can easily enjoy the rest. If you have not read this yet, buy in now, it will not be like any other book you've ever read.",
            "I first read this book while in high school and I still love it 30 years later. It is also a great book for history of the civil war. It is an way for people not southerners to find out how the war was for the south.",
            "Selfish, sought after, sixteen-year-old Katie \"Scarlett\" O'Hara has everything a Southern Belle could want as the story begins in April of 1861: a loving family; a plethora of attentive suitors, and a lovely home on a plantation situated 25 miles from Atlanta, Georgia, maintained by the family's (p 279) hundred slaves. She soon learns that the primary object of her affections, Ashley Wilkes, is to about to announce his engagement. And before you know it, she has professed her love to one man, encountered another (Rhett Butler) for the first time, become engaged, married, pregnant and widowed. Meanwhile, most of the local males have become Confederate soldiers, battling on the side of the South in the Civil War. As the locals mourn their dead and the battles rage on, Scarlett chooses to return to Tara. After surviving a harrowing journey, she learns the fate of her family and home, and takes on roles of caregiver, operations manager, and manual laborer for the plantation along with its remaining inhabitants. She marries, again with ulterior motives, and moves to Atlanta, where her behavior as sole businesswoman starts tongues wagging. One wonders, will she ever find love?When the story ends, twelve years later, the war is over and many of her loved ones have passed. While she learns a few things about friendship, family, love, and loss, some things never change, like her feelings (contempt and disdain) about slaves and beliefs about slavery (better for them than their freedom). With its racist rhetoric, negative stereotypes, and inflammatory words for blacks (the \"n\" word alone appears ninety times), it is a lesson on the incomprehensible capacity of humans to justify their infliction of suffering on others and will likely cause many readers to squirm. But it is also a masterful epic on life and love in the South during the Civil War, with great character development and spectacular writing (including some neat old, odd words) which make it a worthy read from start to 700-plus page finish.",
            "Some of the reviews are long but I will keep this short. Gone With the Wind is the only book I have read twice. I absolutely adored this book and all the characters in it. It is my favourite book of all time and I read all sorts. I bought my mother and sister-in-law a copy because I thought they should read it too (just once). Read it and see for yourself.",
            "I first read this novel the summer I was seventeen. It is a novel that has been handed down in my family for three generations -- and now I know why.Scarlett O'Hara is a spoilt flirtacious southern belle on her father's rich plantation. All the other girls in the county hate and depise her because she has a way of getting her charming claws into their men -- ALL of the men, that is, except \"the long suffering Mr. Wilkes.\"Ashley Wilkes is young, blonde, handsome -- and taken. He is destined to marry Melony Hamilton -- the only woman in the county besides Scarlett's mother who doesn't depise her (ironically enough).Scarlett convinces herself she is in love with Ashley Wilkes, but the truth is she only wants him for the simple reason that she can not have him. Her want becomes an obsession that spans over the next four years of the Civil War and even after. Ashley turns her down in more than one entertaining love scene, one of which is over heard by none other than the the famous Rhett Butler.Rhett Butler is smitten by Scarlett the moment he first sees her because he recognizes in her the same qualities he values in himself: he is a social outcast without clean spot on his reputation. According to the South's unwritten social laws, he is not a gentleman but a scallywag and a cad because he refused to marry a girl he'd taken out without a chaperon. But Rhett is fearless and defiant when it comes to social rules and lives a comfortable life safely outside of \"good\" Southern society which means he openly associates with prostitues and therefore, knows about women's undergarments (something a man is supposed to pretend not to know about).But Rhett's sudden and adrent spark of love for Scarlett is doused somewhat when he learns of Scarlett's apparent love for Ashley Wilkes. He then spends the greater part of the novel fruitlessly pursuing Scarlett and trying to make her forget about Ashley. He married her, saying with a laugh that he \"can't wait all his life to catch her between husbands.\" But Rhett soon finds after the birth of their first child that married life with Scarlett is hell. He can't make love to Scarlett knowing that she's sighing for Ashley Wilkes, and he can't bear to sit across from her at supper anymore knowing that she wants Ashley there. And when Scarlett turns Rhett from her bed it hurts him so that he's driven to mad drinking.And though Scarlett moons after Ashley and fantasizes about him, she slowly but surely falls in love with Rhett. But here's the twist: once Scarlett realizes her love for Rhett and runs to him to proclaim it, she finds that Rhett's deathless love has, well, died, and that he just doesn't \"give a damn\" anymore.This is probably my favorite part of the movie version. I love when Scarlett runs through the mist to find Rhett at home, sitting listlessly before the window with an open suit case on the bed. I must've watched the ending more times than the rest of the movie put together. But nothing moves me more than Scarlett and Rhett's last parting words:\"Rhett! If you go, where shall I go, what shall I do?\"\"Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.\"",
            "THIS IS MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE NOVEL!! I don't care if I sound obsessed; I AM! Sure, I could offer the same criticism that others give (Mitchell was racist, Scarlett was a brat, the ending stunk), but regardless. I'm looking at the bigger picture here. WHAT A SAGA.Scarlett--though I admit, she was a witch sometimes---is truly admirable. She personifies the concepts of tenacity and perseverence, refusing to give up. I look up to her for being fierce, strong, opinionated, and a feminist. She was brave and ardent, and I love her.I forgive Mitchell for being racist in her writings, because she was most accurately portraying that time period. Honestly, I forgive any fault of the book, it was just so good!The conclusion...eh. I would have ended it at the end of the second-to-last chapter. But I'm not the author, I have no room to talk. She did a brilliant job illustrating the lives of members of the Confederacy, so lets give her proper credit and not denounce her.What else is there to say? These online reviews couldn't encompass it all, BY FAR. The novel was just delicious. I ate it all in less than two months' time (and it's a hearty meal, believe me). It surpasses the movie in my opinion, but both are exquisite masterpieces. READ IT READ IT READ IT READ IT!",
            "Gone With The Wind. Those immortal words are etched into the brains of generations. With those words come the acclaim and popularity it earned. To me, it was nothing more than a book. The swriting style of Margaret Mitchell is wonderful and I think that she brings authenticity to her work. That and only that is why i gave it four stars. Many of my female peers fell in love with the book. Maybe it was meant to be a feminine novel, not written for the eyes of a young man such as myself. It took me longer than most books to read and when I had finished it it left me with no sense of awe or despair at not having a decent sequel(which I am told is terrible). No, it left my with only one thought &quot;I wonder if I wasted my time.&quot;The story follows the majority of the life of Scarlett O' Hara, a ruthless southern belle, whose dellusions of love lead her to keep her foothold in the world. During her travels (or should I say misadventures?), she comes across a man named Rhett Butler. Rhett is a smart, dark, and deceptive character who flaunts his wealth and charm. He would have to be my favourite character because, as is so uncommon tday in literature, his character was believable and dark. His openness with his shortcomings and his lifestyle give him a sense of nonchalance that is a credit to Mitchell's style. However this is where my enjoyment stopped. The story seemed to drag unnecessarily and I did not speed through it as I thought I would when i heard how &quot;wonderful&quot; it was. The storyline was relatively simple and easy to understand, but it just does not gain my utmost appreciation as a classic in literature.",
            "What can you say about this novel? The prose evokes comparison to Edith Wharton's. The characters live and breathe before you on the page. The setting is set in intimate detail, and it swirls in your mind's eye as you drink in the words. Amazing novel. Scarlett seems much stronger in literature than her flighty character in the film. Once I could escape my preconceived notion of the characters taken from the film, the book became pure joy to read.",
            "Gone With The Wind is a great book,about a young girl, Scarlett, who is a terrible flirt. I read it this summer and I'm only nine, the context wasn't too challenging. M.M. wove the story plot extremely well,it kept me in suspense until the very end, and I want to read the sequal. All in all , if I could, I would give this book infinity stars.",
            "Gone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell is a classic historical fiction novel with vivid descriptions of the Old South and the Civil War. It is from the Confederate's point of view, and the protagonist is Scarlett O'Hara, a headstron, stubborn, and spoiled Southern Belle with deep strength and passion. If Scarlett needs something bad enough, she will not hesitate to throw away proper social conduct or her own personal goals. This strength comes not from within her, but from using the misfortunes of others to her advantage. She is like a child in the sense that she orders people around and always gets her way. The problem in the long run is that this strenth all too often blinds her to the good things and the love that reaches out to her, but she pushes them away, so set in her own ways that she wont even consider other possibilities. Tara is Scarlett's one true love, and she would do anything for it. Scarlett survives the hardships of war as her would falls down around her with only her wit and determination left. She cannot ignore life, nor can she put on a polite mask and act as though there had never been a war. She uses the struggle to rebuild Atlanta to make her start in business. Although Scarlett is a strong and independent woman, most people can relate to her because she makes mistakes like a normal human. This book examines different types of strength. Whether it is Mammy's honorable courage and dignity, or Rhett's keen level-headedness, or Melanie's Christian devotion to people, each person has his or her own root from which they draw their strength. The writing is superb, and the plot is dramatic and sad, but it includes enough of Scarlett's triumphs of strength that sets it apart from all other books. This is a must-read for any person who loves classic literature.",
            "This book touched the hearts of millions, and truly makes us realize the appreciation of life. I found myself so much like Scarlett, that I began to chenge my ways, and learned to be a self-less person. You know how the book always better than the movie? Well, for those of you who saw the film, (probably the best film ever made; it was rated higher than Titanic!), you can imagine how good this book must be!!! Trust me-TAKE MY ADVICE! I AM A FULL TIME READER!!! THIS BOOK IS THE CREAM OF THE CROP!!!!!!!",
            "I had to add my accolades to those who declare GWTW the great American novel, and weigh the vote beyond the 4+ it currently has. Who are these people giving a novel so rich in in scope, so remakable in the development, so intense you can smell the magnolias, a one? It is the only book I have ever read more than twice. Double or tripple readings are only for those very, very special books, right? If it were not for the movie and the hype, the book would have more respect. GWTW forever!",
            "This is a great novel. Do not let its success fool you into thinking it isn't that good. I won't repeat the many positive reviews here. Just let me add one note: the book has an extraordinary amount of cynicism in it which is startling at first but makes perfect sense as this novel is about the destruction of all that is good by men-on a large scale, the south's destruction, on a smaller scale, the destruction of Rhett's love by the vices and selfishness of Scarlett.",
            "I have read Gone With the Wind 16 times(I'm eleven yrs. old)and it still ties for my favorite book(with The Mists of Avalon) I know all anyone would ever want to know about the movie(and a lot more besides)and plenty about the book. The ending is perfect and appropriate for the story, the characters are interesting, tightly intertwined into the story, and so real it feels like I am standing there in a hoop skirt and corset whenever I read the book(my waist constricts and everything)",
            "The book is as good as it can get. I read it while in high school, then again a few years later while in college. I'd like to read its sequel. The climax however was not quite as hunky dory as I would have liked it. It was one of my first books other than the normal run-of-the-mill stuff like adventure stories so its left quite a positive impact on me.",
            "I loved this book. I read it twice in the past year. The story is beautifully written. Margaret Mitchell is a genious. The quote &quot;After all tomorrow is another day,&quot; is the quote we all will repeat to ourselves to make life seem easier. Life goes on.",
            "I first read GWTW when I was 16 years old, and I've been spellbound ever since. This is a book that truly made me feel as if I'd known the characters for years; I cried with every defeat and celebrated every defeat with Scarlett. Once you pick it up, you can't put it down until it's finished. I felt that it was similar to &quot;North and South&quot; in content, but that the emphasis on the characters was more personal. Also, it has a little of everything--history (without being dull), romance (without being overdone), and personal triumph.",
            "One of the richest books I have ever read. The story completely snares you until the last page, and even when you've finished you will find yourself thinking about it. For anyone who wants an explosion of a story and an outstanding mixture of characters, this novel will always be amoung the top suggestions...",
            "I first read this book at age 13 only cause it was required reading for an English class. I ended up reading all night and was wiped the next day in school. It's impossible to put down.Now 25 years and many thousands of books later it is still my favorite book. I get so mad at Scarlett, we should all be so lucky to find a Rhett and she doesn't appreciate him! Still makes me cry.",
            "I think &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; was a great book. I liked the book better than the movie. The book went into more detail than the movie. I wish Scarlett would have waited for Rhett when he was in jail though. I wish Scarlett would have just admitted to Rhett that she loved him sooner. I think Ashley was kind of a wimp, and I did not understand why Scarlett had wanted Ashley when she had a man like Rhett who wanted her. I was glad when she tried to get him back at the end and I can't wait to get the sequel.",
            "I'm 16, just finnished it, the only regret I have is not reading it sooner. Mitchell did a beautiful job. I became so swept up into the story I couldn't put it down for a second. It's almost like be there, back in the 1800's, during the civil war. You feel the characters, there joy, there pain. The movie wasn't that great! I look forward to reading the sequal. I highly recomend this book, you won't be sorry after reading it.",
            "During the past summer I read a tremendous novel, Gone With the Wind. Margret Mitchell is an amazing author even by picking up the dilect of Mammy and the slaves. Even though I'm not American and don't study their history I understood and learned a lot from this book. This book is comedic, dramatic, exciting and filled with romance. The friends/foes/lovers relationship between Rhett and Scarlett is unforgettable. I found this to be a truly inspirational book, how to treat people properly and how to be a true friend and lover. This book is amazing , I couldn't put it down and I finished it in only 3 days. I am also starting to read the sequel &quot;Scarlett&quot; by Alexandra Riply. I give this book 5 stars! *****Jenn",
            "I have reread this book four times in the last year, and everytime I read it, I catch more than the previous time. The love story told compares to that of Romeo and Juliet. The sequencing of events could not be better; it grips you until the last page, and leaves you wondering how Scarlett deals with her personal losses. The intermixing of historical fact and fictional characters is phenomenal. Never again will a novel soar as high as this; it is as popular as the Bible.",
            "I think that it is the best story I have ever read!! It was magnificent detail, and includes everything, from history to love to war and action. Amazing the way Mitchell makes you think about everything. I would reccomend anybody who likes good reading, to read it.",
            "I read GWTW when I was in the 5th grade. I fell in love with it instantly, and have never read a better book since. This book has affected how I think and act. You can't help but admire Scarlett and all she stands for. At times all she had was her determination to survive and her pride. Once in school we had to do a report on the person we most admire. I had to convince the teacher to let me do it on Scarlett. Whenever I come to a hard time in my life, I try to be strong and I compare strong to Scarlett. This book tells not only how the South was affected but how the lives of the woman left behind were affected by the Civil War. The book is so vivid that you feel that you are with Scarlett, Rhett, and all the other unforgettable characters. I hope that I meet a man like Rhett. He loved Scarlett for years, knowing the worst of her but still loving her despite her faults. The book is the epitome of the Old South; with all the grace, beauty, and pride to go along with it.",
            "I loved this book! I love to read about the Civil War and this book takes you from the beginning to the end of this great time period. I'm 14 years old and a lot of my 8th grade classmates thought I was nuts to read it. But I didn't let that get in my way. I've seen the movie and don't think it got even close to the book. If you want to read a great romance/adventure/tradgedy this is the book for you!",
            "I read Gone With the Wind in the seventh grade, and since then have read it several times. To me it is an inspiration; its plot is magnificent, its characters well developed and true. It is a book that truly embodies the dream of writing the &quot;Great American Novel&quot;",
            "This novel singlehandedly got me addicted to reading! I thought I didn't have time in my busy schedule, but now I make time! I never wanted this book to end!",
            "I had always been a fan of the movie adaptation of Maragret Mitchell's \"Gone With the Wind\" but I had never gotten around to reading the book (I know--BAD READER!) so when I saw audible had a version of GWTW available, I decided to try it out. It's a long book but I figured my familiarity with the story line would help me through it.Why did I wait so long to read this book--it was wonderful! So much more than the movie, with additional detail and real perspective on the characters. Those overwraught emotions make so much more sense after reading the book! Although there is a rich historical background in this novel, it's really about one woman's struggle against herself, her time, and her enemies.I also really enjoyed the narrator of this audio book. She did a wonderful job of bringing the story alive and giving depth to the different characters (with different voices and inflections) and had a wonderful way of telling the story.If you are a fan of GWTW the movie and have never read the book, I urge you to get out there and find a copy. You won't be disappointed with this rich historical drama.",
            "romance, history, tears... the book is a master piece... if the ending gave me more, i would have jumped with joy but... still it is a really good book... teaches you from the perspective of the south and even makes you feel so sorry for scarlet... i never really liked rhett because he just didn't seem like he loved her.. i guess he sort of didn't.. well it was wonderful^^",
            "I read this book the first time when I was 14, after the re-release of the movie. I saw that the book had been re-released on a visit to the library, and checked it out. Well, a casual reader cannot read \"Gone with the Wind\" in the one week the library gives you for new books, so I bought this copy from Amazon, and took it with me on a 10 day vacation. Almost done reading it. Think I will read \"Scarlet\" next.",
            "It's a good story. And the typing is perfect, clear, and the language is totally understandable. It seems like I am right there listening, learning, and getting a full understanding of what is going on. It's wonderful. I haven't been able to finish it because of shakespeare reading, but I am rushing through William to get to Margret. Good writing. And a wonderful classic read.",
            "Wow, the civil war from the southern POV, who knew? Yes, racism is rampant, but I loathe history and I loved this book.",
            "I absolutely LOVED the book! I never would have read the book, but I read a review somewhere that someone said don't wait until you're 50 years old like her to read the book. It was very easy to read and I enjoyed the author's writing style. Even though the book was Fiction, Mitchell wrote it with realistic and actual events of the pre/post Civil War. I had a great and better understanding of why the Southerners thought the way they did about the Yankees and continue to grasp their love for their land, values, and ideals of the Old South even to this day.I had seen the movie, \"Gone with the Wind\" a few years back but didn't get a true appreciation of it of why it was such a great movie, and after reading the book, I purchased the DVD. Having read the book, it was easy to follow and understand the movie which doesn't always capture the true essence of the book.I am on a pursuit of reading classic novels and this was on my list. Take the time to read this book...it is quite large so it will take some time to read but is well worth it.",
            "This wonderful book deserves 10 stars at least. I just re-read it and, even now 30 years after I first read it, it still stands head and shoulders above any other work of fiction I've ever read.There is good reason why GWTW remains so enduringly popular. First of all is Margaret Mitchell's wonderful verbosity; this allows her to describe the physical setting in lush detail and to create characters of enduring interest and complexity. When it comes to characterization, no author I've ever read can even touch Margaret Mitchell's skill.But what also makes GWTW so enduring popular is its readability. Except for Scarlett's occasional \"Fiddle-dee-dee\" and \"God's nightgown!\" and the almost unintelligible dialogue of the blacks, Gone With the Wind reads like something written by a modern day author. The language is simple and direct and forthright, never complex or flowery. This gives the book a timelessness and makes it, even at 900+ pages, an amazingly fast read.Although reading GWTW this time as a middle-aged adult I found it far more tragic and sad and far less romantic, what I appreciated more about it was the background story and the way the author worked it seamlessly into her narrative. She vividly describes the effects of the war and Reconstruction on Southern society in a way that is evocative without ever sounding bitter or angry.If you've never read GWTW then you owe it to yourself to do so immediately if not sooner! Trust me, you'll never be sorry that you did. The characters of Rhett, Scarlett, Ashley and Melanie will become like real people who will live on in your mind forever.",
            "In time for the Diamond Anniversary of the publication of this formidable American classic, as well as the 150th anniversary of the Civil War that it depicts, I present my editorial musings about Margaret Mitchell's iconic literary piece.As an African American, it was a touchy and sometimes uncomfortable read for me. But as a child of Barbadians, my ancestors had been free for roughly 30 years by the time the story begins, and as subjects of the British Crown, had the option of attending British Universities, whereas America was on the verge of its most catastrophic war, in which slavery was a major issue, and Jim Crow laws would succeed slavery, I can and did read this novel with a little more detachment than most African Americans could.It took me 17 days to complete it, my eyes flowing faciley over the pages of the Avon Book rendition.Margaret Mitchell introduces her heroine, Katie Scarlett O'Hara, a willful green-eyed beauty of Franco-Irish descent, on an April day in 1861, where the 16-year-old is entertaining two suitors, the Tarleton Twins, on the front porch of her family's Georgia plantation, Tara.The lanky handsome red-haired Tarleton Twins, Stuart, and Brent, had been expelled from college,but were planning to join the Confederate Army, and they begin to aggravate their coquettish young hostess with their frequent talk of war. Scarlett threatens to go inside and lock herself away if they fail to change the topic of conversation, and is obliged. In due time, of course, the young Southern Belle would have to shed her preconceived notions about war as a gender-segregated issue, and accept it as everyone's business, regardless of gender.In the meantime, the topic turns to the upcoming barbecue at the neighboring Wilkes plantation, Twelve Oaks, where the handsome, blond Ashley Wilkes, whom Scarlet desires above all others, resides with his widowered father, John, and sisters, India and Honey. She learns Ashley will marry his cousin, Melanie Hamilton, who is sweet, delicate, and of a milder mold than she, who despises her.Literally turning into something of a green-eyed monster, Scarlett schemes to steal Ashley from Melanie--a central plot in the story.Her firey Irish father, Gerald, discourages her pursuit of Ashley, knowing such a union would be an unhappy one. Like most of the men closest to Scarlett, he had her best interest at heart.Her mother, Ellen Robillard O'Hara, from a notable French family from Savannah, tends to the plantation, nursing the sick, settling the accounts of the estate, and spending ample time delivering and baptizing the out-of-wedlock children of the impoverished Emmie Slattery, who are fathered by the O'Hara's Yankee overseer, Jonas Wikerson.Although better educated that the lowly Slatteries, his profession bars him from association with Georgia's upper echelon. So he turns to the lowly Slattereys for companionship.Ellen asks her husband to fire Wilkerson for his immorality, but Gerald refuses.Ellen appears too busy to really notice her oldest daughter's intrigues.The evening ritual of family prayers provides some temporary solace for Scarlett, who has quarreled with younger sisters Careen (baptized Caroline Irene) and Sue Ellen(baptized Susan Elinor). Servants Mammy, Pork, Dilcey, and Prissy stand guard as Ellen leads the family in Roman Catholic breviaries.Mammy knows Scarlett best, and calls her out as her charges prepares to attend the barbecue, but Scarlett has ways of manipulating Mammy to get her way.At the barbecue, Scarlett shines. In due time, it is revealed that all the men who will play a pivotal role in her life are there. She gathers her suitors under a tree, flushed and flirtatious.In the meantime, a mysterious man from Charleston with a murky reputation has his eye on the raven-haired beauty. As Scarlett is winning men's hearts, this man, Rhett Butler, earns the ire of the same men by giving them a realistic account of their chances of defeating the Yankees, as he has visited Northern factories, and areas of that region many of John Wilkes' guests had not.Gradually, it will be seen that Rhett Butler is right, and most of the men quarreling with him are dead.Slipping away from the rooms where the young ladies are napping, Scarlett confronts Ashley in the library to reveal her feelings, and is gently rebuffed. In a tearful rage, she slaps the man she claims to love and throws a china bowl decorated with roses, smashing it, and startling Rhett, who had been sleeping on the couch, initially out of her sight. Her response to his remarks about her behavior reveal her to be unsure of her own mind where Ashley is concerned.Amid Scarlett's dealing with the hurtful sniping of other young ladies, the word gets out that recruits are called for and all eligible men, including Ashley, rush off to enlist.A moment of desperate jealousy towards Ashley and Melanie leads Scarlett into an ill-conceived union with Melanie's brother, Charles--the day before Ashley and Melanie's marriage--. Charles dies of illness while at war, leaving Scarlett widowed and pregnant with their son, Wade, with whom, like many parents in wartime, Scarlett will have difficulty bonding.During a visit with her Aunt Pittypat, the widow scandalizes Atlanta by dancing with blockade runner Rhett at a ball benefitting the troops, while clad in widow's weeds.The story follows the young beauty through nursing soldiers with Dr. Meade and a pregnant Melanie, her frustration with Prissy during Melanie's labor(Prissy's simplemindedness was most likely a ruse as it was for most slaves), and her perilous flight back to Tara from Atlanta despite bad weather and battles, during which Rhett journeys with her only part of the way before rushing off to enlist.With Melanie, Wade, Prissy and newborn Beau in tow, she returns to find Tara still standing, unlike Twelve Oaks, although blighted by soldier's lootings, Mammy, Pork, and Dilcey about the only remaining servants, her sisters ailing, her father non compos mentos, and her mother dead of typhoid fever contracted from nursing Emmie Slattery.Finding only rotten produce to eat, she vows to rebuild her life by any means necessary, and as the saying goes, \"There is nothing angrier than an educated Southern lady.\"Using all her cunning, education,and inner strength unleashed by harsh circumstances, she acheives her goal at the expense of many friendships, marrying twice more, bearing daughters Ella(by Frank Kennedy, the \"old maid in britches\" she steals from sister, Sue Ellen when she realizes his business can help pay the taxes on Tara) and Bonnie(by Rhett) along the way--the last of whose strong will matches her mother's, leading to grave consequences.In a very poignant ending, Scarlett does come to appreciate how much Melanie really means to her, seeing how her kindness and fortitude complemented and buttressed her own grit and determination, and she finally sees Ashley as a hopeless and perpetual dreamer in view of her own willingness to face and deal with life's realities head-on.Intriguing characters include the amputee soldier, Will Benteen,and the crude Hillbilly, Archie, whose history proves the practice of Honor Death was not confined to Mid-Eastern culture. Both show how the war brought disparate social groups together, as does Madame Belle Watling.The political incorrectness, mysogyny, and racism may ruffle a few feathers. But it is appreciated that these people were products of their time, although impressively, Scarlett's mother forbade her to use the \"N\" word.Still, this story is an American epic that reflects the resilience of a human spirit that never conceded defeat.I recall that during a televised airing of the film version of this epic in the early 1980s, the announcer referred to Scarlett as \"The Jewel of Tara\", and indeed, in facing life's great calamities, she does prove to be \"Diamond hard\".",
            "\"Burdens are for shoulders strong enough to carry them\"Tara Plantation, near Jonesborough, near Atlanta, GeorgiaKatie \"Scarlett\" O'Hara is the most charming Southern belle, gathering the attention of beaux all over the surrounding areas. But when she learns the man she had been psuedo-courting, Ashley Wilkes, is marrying Melanie Hamilton from Atlanta, his cousin, she schemes to win him back. When he refuses, she immediately marries Charles Hamilton in spite. But Civil War has come to the South, and Scarlett quickly finds herself a widow, stuck in Atlanta, with a child, unable to be the pretty belle she had been a few months prior. Will Scarlett ever get Ashley? What about the strange Rhett Butler character, who is constantly tweaking her? Will Scarlett and her family survive the war?Let me preface my review with this: I don't read a lot of historical fiction or chick lit or romance or anything. My speciality is science fiction, fantasy, and urban fantasy. However, this book absolutely, positively blew me away!At first, I found the novel a bit slow. There were so many characters, and at first, it seemed like nothing happened. But that wasn't to last. Quickly, I became interested in Scarlett's schemes to snatch Ashley away from Melanie, all the while hating her for her bad behavior. By the end of the book, there were points were I was in near tears.Scarlett wasn't my favorite character. She was a rude, bitter, selfish woman. But I completely understood her predicament. To the reader, she was completely honest, despising her first husband's death (and life!), her dislike of children (don't see that much in romance do we!), her dislike of women's poor station (always having to act \"silly\" in front of the menfolk), and taking the reigns of business to make a life of her own. So while I didn't like her, I also didn't hate her. I understood what she was trying to do and found myself rooting for her against the odds. She is a brilliantly written character, so dynamic, multifaceted and full.Melanie Hamilton was probably my favorite character. This might seem odd as she does come off as a Mary Sue--perfect and sweet to everyone, always right, yada, yada--and I hate Mary Sues. But I really never found Melanie a Mary Sue. Scarlett repeatedly downplays Melanie's beauty. Melanie is strong-willed and works diligently, but tires easily (such as when she works at Tara in the cotton fields). Like Scarlett, Melanie was definitely not a 1-D character. She appeared weak on the outside, while maintaining strenght in the face of danger, in the face of childbirth, in the face of hard times. She was a true inspiration to me.Rhett Butler made me so furious, sometimes I wanted to slap him like Scarlett! But other times, he was so charming and debonair, that I wanted to melt in his arms like butter. I loved how forthright he was, how practical and realistic he was, and yet how at times, his passionate nature came through (joining the Confederate army at the end, for example).Side characters, such as Miss Pittypat, Mammy, Dilcey, Pork, Uncle Peter, Mrs. Meade, Belle Watling, and more, jumped out at me. They felt like real people, people influenced by dreams, desires, and feelings. Probably one of the sweetest moments was when Dr. and Mrs. Meade were talking and she mentioned she would rather him be at Belle's than dead. Given what Mrs. Meade had been through, what she held dear, it was particularly poignant.I could go on endlessly about the amazing life lessons and themes and symbols in the book. Quotes about the status of women at the time, about changing with the changing times, about strength of character, about being who you are, and about what is really important in life abound in this book. Most of the ones that really touched me may be found on my profile page, though the whole book is brimming with it.As this deals with the South during the Civil War, there is much talk of slavery; one of the reasons, I believe, it has been so frequently placed on the Banned Books list. Some people believe that it shows slavery in a favorable light, that blacks were/are children that need to be tended by whites. My opinion is this: it shows how many white Southern plantation owners viewed slaves. Not all slave owners were Mr. Simon Legree of Uncle Tom's Cabin. Conversely, not all slave owners are like the O'Hara's. Yes, there are a lot of black stereotypes (Mammy, Prissy, etc.), but this is a snapshot into the past. You can't take this book and try to force modern views of civil rights and racism into it. However, I do believe it makes a brilliant discussion piece: comparing Scarlett and other Southern whites' views of blacks with other accounts (such as Uncle Tom's Cabin or the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn).All in all, this is a brilliant book, made more excellent by the narrator, who deftly interprets the Southern dialect and accents for the listener. I thoroughly enjoyed it and was heart-broken, but inspired, when it ended. I highly recommend, even to those, like me, who aren't big into historical fiction.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*",
            "Great book just as I knew it would be. I can't believe that I've never read it til now. The movie itself is one of my all-time favorites, but they changed quite a few things which bugs me & the book's so much better. I can't wait to read \"Scarlett\" the sequel...",
            "I know this film so well and often quote dialogue but had never read the book. My first purchase on the Kindle and off camping. A thousand pages of southern saga sweeping off the page. It amazed me how the characters in the book are simply written descriptions of the eventual actors. You would recognise Clark Gable and Vivienne Leigh, even Melanie and Ashley like old friends. It was amazing. Also made me understand better a few things in the movie that were not clear to me - the Ku Klux Klan for example.If you are a fan of the movie but had never read the book - do so. It may be from the 1930's but the story holds, as does the film. Well worth the read and a great camping weekend relax.",
            "It's no wonder this is the second most sold book in history. The movie just doesn't do the book justice; the book really puts you in the south during the Civil War. Great read!",
            "It took me until age 35 to read this book. So glad I did! I read it over a two month span and was so sorry to reach the end.",
            "Truly a classic by Margaret Mitchell. This was one book I read and loved since high school days, and that was forty plus years ago. The literary style with its vivid descriptions is excellent - the unforgettable civil war of the late 1800's,the rebuilding of the beautiful Tara estate, and of course the emotional stirrings and passion of both Scarlet O' Hara and Rhett Butler. All these and more bring us back to the good old days and the lessons that we have learned to value through the times.",
            "BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ. I ORDERED FOR MY KINDLE AND I HAVE IN PAPERBACK. BUY AND ENJOY SCARLETT AND RHETT",
            "This is my second time reading Gone With the Wind (I read it once in high school) and it didn't disappoint the second time around. In fact, I think I love it even more now, with a little life experience under my belt. Just a pleasure to read.",
            "This is a rich, breathtaking classic that can (and should) be read over and over again. It is a long, long story spanning twelve eventful years, but it is definitely worth the time it takes to read. The book is like an epic - Margaret Mitchell's voice is powerful, poetic, wise. Characters are the most important element of a book for me, and this book has the most beautiful, complex, unique characters I have ever encountered in a work of fiction. Scarlett never ceases to amaze me - her resourcefulness and ambition are incredible for a woman of her time. It is incredible how tragedy transforms her - from flighty and carefree to a harsh, driven woman whose compelling desire is to return to the security and prosperity before the war. She is also a frustrating protagonist in her narrow-minded stubbornness and inability to understand others and her own heart. Rhett Butler is the other character in this novel that captivates me. Readers will love his subtle sarcasm, sharp wit, and suave mannerisms. It's impossible not to! He is the quintessential \"bad boy\" that countless authors have tried to recreate. But he runs deep too, especially in his love for Scarlett and sentimentality for the charm of the Old South.The historical fiction aspect of the novel is extraordinary as well. I fell in love with the deep South as Mitchell described it, even though I have no connection to that part of America. I never considered the plight of Southerners during and after the Civil War, but this book revealed its devastating effect on the people and customs of the South. Books about the destruction of a society rarely end happily. But it surprised and disheartened me when the author paralleled Scarlett and Rhett's love story with the downfall of the South.",
            "I loved Gone with the Wind.. The time period was a crucial time for shaping America as we now know it. So many things stand out in my mind from the book but the one that I see the most is the relationship between Scarlett and Rhett. I think we know he loves her from the moment on the stairs at Twelve Oaks.. Scarlett to me seems like our modern day power hungry woman.. going against tradition in a mans world and proving a woman can survive..however she did marry Mr. Kennedy..but he was just a means to an end.. nothing more to her but a way to get what she wanted.. Then again like many modern day women her children were not anyone she really cared to be around and left them in the care of others while she worked hard to get the money she so wanted.. I think Scarlett always loved Rhett and did not know it till the end and when she found out she saw that she finally had all the money she could need but she did not have the one thing that could truley make her happy.. LOVE.. The story left me a little sad because of all that the people went through during those years of war and reconstruction.. but with those changing times we saw the freedom that so many deserved and the way of life of the South forever changed (regardless of those who can not seem to except that after all these years) I myself am a southerner and I can say that there were many things about the old south that seem magical..but so many others that were just plain wrong. Gone with the Wind shows so much of the Old South and of all the characters I think Mammy was the strongest and smartest of them all.. She was a woman that could tell you right from wrong in a world that you thought you knew everything and she stood by her \"family\" through more than blood kin would have.. Gone with the Wind is a must have on any book shelf.",
            "This is my all time favorite. My Nana lived five houses away from MM in Ansley Park, an Atlanta suburb. She pointed out the house many times, she must have thought I wasn't listening. Nana, a staunch Presbyterian finally broke down and read the book, considered somewhat scandalous. (my mother said that Nana disappeared for days until she finished it...and did like it) Margaret was a bit ahead of her time...wanting to be a journalist, to work where only men were permitted. Finally, just to get her off their back...The Atlanta Constitution hired her to cover the homicide division. She flourished.She married Red, then divorced him but they would \"meet up\" from time to time. Apparently there was ample chemistry. She fashioned Rhett Butler after her handsome rogue of a husband so much so that MGM required Margaret to get a release from him fearing some kind of lawsuit. He signed it gladly, happy for the likeness.I first read the book at age 16 and have since read it five more times. The research for its historical accuracy, the language, the complex characters, the rich texture of the tale and then the FABULOUS ending! Still impressive. Pulitzer Prize, movie, MM's only book, has moved me in a different way each time I sit down with it.",
            "This vivid tale of the Civil War and Reconstruction is not idealism (as reviews calling it racist imply) but realism. The rich characterizations and deep plot reveal its author to be one of profound understanding, not only of human nature and of life itself, but also of the forgotten, overlooked, untaught aspects of war and racial strife.Observe the polemics of those who call it racist. I dare say that that charge would be made by the same people of any book using any approbrious terminology whatever, regardless of the context.Also, as you read the negative reviews, notice the consistent lack of specifics of those who doubt its historical validity. There will not be one single example. This is part of their method of deterence, and they have nothing but hollow, unsupported invective. Anyone who needs clarification is welcome to email me.I am a constant reader, and I found Gone With the Wind not only sublime in its narrative and poetic in its dialogue, but an excellent adventure into the &quot;house of cards&quot; that was the lives of the Southern aristocracy.",
            "Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler are classic charecters along with the rest of them. They're as classic as the story. So much history is in the book. It gives a clear and good picture of how it was during that time. Everything isn't perfect. I'm 11 years old. That may seem too young to understand such a classic love story but I did. It was even better than other love stories like Wuthering Heights or Jane Eyre. Not to say they aren't classics. Ms. Mitchell writes the story clearly and comes straight to the point unlike for instance Henry James who takes up 2 pages to describe a woman's dress. If you read one love story in your life or watch one movie make it Gone with the Wind.",
            "As with all great classics, I am hard-pressed to say anything original about Gone With the Wind. This is my second reading and I still love the book. If you have seen the movie, but have not read the book, read the book. There is a great deal more that will only add to your enjoyment of the storyline.Some things I did not know about Margaret Mitchell made re-reading the book all the more interesting (thank you Wikipedia). Mitchell's maternal great-grandfather was from Ireland and settled on a slaveholding plantation in Georgia. Her grandfather fought in the Civil War and made a lot of money in the lumber business after the war (just like Scarlett!). As a young girl, Mitchell heard a lot of Civil War stories from her relatives and visited the ruined plantations in Georgia. And, most interesting to me was that her mother was a women's rights activist.I think these points are important because they give you a better understanding of the characters in GWTW. And I think the most interesting point is Mitchell's portrayal of Scarlett as a shrewd and independent businesswoman during a time when no women ran businesses or even played a role in commerce, except maybe in selling pies like Mrs. Merriwether and taking in sewing and boarders like Mrs. Elsing. (Or Belle Watling's business. Belle's character is also quite modern, profession aside.) Mitchell also portrays Ellen, Scarlett's mother, as the true head of the plantation, with Gerald as a figurehead.Although I love this book, it is difficult to read the sections about slavery and the slaves on the O'Hara plantation. The O'Haras take pride in their kind treatment of their slaves, yet the O'Haras and other plantation owners come off as very condescending. And who knows whether kind treatment was common on all southern plantations. It's a bad part of American history and all accounts of this time-period make you cringe. But I think it's important to note that some of Mitchell's slave characters (Mammy, Pork, Uncle Peter) are smarter and wiser than their owners.I think Mitchell's description of the post-war period is very good and it shows what a mess Atlanta was and how the Southern way of life known and loved by its people was forever lost. I like how the characters, particularly Melanie and her followers cling to their committees and old customs, even when the Northerners take over the city.There are certainly many, many other points to add about the characters and the book, Melanie's goodness, Ashley's displacement in the new South, and Scarlett's inability to understand and appreciate the people around her until it is too late.I like Rhett Butler the best. He is very modern, thinking it ridiculous never to mention pregnancy and birth control. He loves children and these things make him even more appealing. You want to forget how he makes his money, his drinking and what he does over at Belle's house because he is so likeable and smooth. His flirtatious conversations with Scarlett are so fun to read, but my favorite parts are when Rhett shows his true feelings to Melanie, and sadly to Scarlett at the end.",
            "Simply put, Gone With The Wind is a masterpiece of epic proportions. It doesn't get any better than this. The movie by comparison is an utter waste of time. I have read Gone With The Wind over and over again and it never gets old. I couldn't recommend a book more.",
            "I never saw the classic movie Gone With the Wind until I was in my late teens. But I had read the book. Of course I'd heard of the movie, and I had a vague idea that it was a romance tale set during the Civil War. But something drew me to it. Perhaps I picked up that it was an epic tale, or something similar.Anyway, one day while walking through a book store while in my early teens, I decided it was time I learned what all the fuss was about. Being a guy, I didn't expect to find much to like, but I figured I give the novel a chance.I'm glad I did.Yes, at its heart, Gone With the Wind is a romance story, though some might consider it a tragedy since (SPOILER ALERT) the romance dies in the end, but I loved the story.The characters were grand. The backdrop was ... well, it was epic, truth be told. The plotting was somewhat complex without being overly complicated. And it was pretty good writing.So why should I shun a novel just because it's romance? Because I'm a guy? That's silly.Especially considering, at least in my own opinion, this novel is so much more than just a romance. Believe me, as a form of education I've read a few romance novels. None of them come close to anything like Gone With the Wind.No bodice ripping here. There a scream or two from the heroine, but they're at appropriate times. And what a heroine! Scarlett O'hara is no wilting violet waiting for a man to save the day. No, she has no problems standing up for herself, maybe too much at times. In fact, Scarlett's hard-headedness is one of the character's tragic flaws within the novel.Okay, if you're one of those guy readers who thinks you could never pick up a romance novel, do yourself a favor and read Gone With the Wind. Though it's set in the American Civil War, you're not going to find page after page of descriptions of troop movements and battles and all that jazz. But you will find complex, interesting characters who are as real, as bold, and sometimes as weak as any found in the best literature of the world.",
            "This is the classic tale of wanting what you can't have ... until you can. Romance aside, this book is chock full of history, drama, suspense, emotional turmoil and philosophical whimsy. It's peppered with a dry, cynical wittiness that will keep you, not only turning pages, but smiling, laughing, and even occasionally gasping incredulously. Especially whenever the irresistible Rhett Butler enters a scene.The dialogue is simply smashing. The characters are realistic and resonate on a soul deep level. This is something that the movie version was, understandably, unable to pull off. Scarlett came across as a one dimensional, selfish, cold hearted monster on the big screen. In the book, however, we have behind the scenes access to her mind, heart, will and emotions. When this story is appreciated in literary form, one finds it difficult to either love or hate her entirely because, just as in reality, there are too many shades of gray.I have seen some people label this book as racist and intolerant. While I agree that there are some rather uncomfortable themes and an indisputable usage of inappropriate language, readers must bear in mind that this is a work of fiction depicting the culture and mind sets of characters living during the Civil War period. If the story had been written in any other way, it would have detracted from the authenticity of the tale. That being said, if you are sensitive to such things, you should probably steer clear.As far as I am concerned, this is a must read for any fan of historical fiction. Yet, I must warn you; Don't expect a happy or conclusive ending lest you be disappointed. After reading Forever Amber and many Anita Shreve books, I am always emotionally prepared for such a let down. Still, that didn't stop me from turning the last page of Gone With The Wind, anxiously looking for more. I was breathless with wonder, racked with unanswered questions, passionately angry at fate and, of course, torn between love and hate. When you really stop to think about it though, how could two personalities as dashingly quixotic as Scarlett and Rhett be expected to depart in any other fashion?",
            "I read GWTW one summer when I was a teenager, and got completely absorbed in it. I woke up one morning to the smell of bacon and stretched luxuriously in my bed as if I were Scarlett. Margaret Mitchell created a rich view of the antebellum south and characters that seemed real, making it easy for a reader to feel the horrors of the Civil War and empathize with the characters. Mitchell once said that Scarlett was a hussy, so I guess she was, but I never saw her that way. To me, she was a strong young woman who was forced out of her pampered world, determined to seize control of the future instead of cowering in a corner, even if it made her a social outcast.",
            "Margaret Mitchell wrote one of the most popular novels of all time. Set against the breath-taking backdrop of the red hills of Georgia during the American Civil War, Gone With the Wind is a window into a society that was swept away by war. Although I must say I doubt the portrayal of slavery is authentic in this work, every other aspect must be accurate. I have read some background information on Mitchell and, to my knowledge, she spent a significant amount of time researching every detail of her story--even down to the time of day that the list of deaths from the Battle of Gettysburg arrived in Atlanta.As a Southerner, I am proud of Mitchell's success and her novel. I would have to say that this is my favorite novel of all time--a great epic about the South and its storied past.However, as vast as the setting may be, it's easy to forget that there are two different plots going on: that of Georgia, and the South, during the Civil War, and that of Scarlett O'Hara and her struggle of hunger, poverty, love, and much more. The timing that Margaret Mitchell used in her novel (i.e. the death of Melanie, thus setting Ashley free; but at the same time realizing she, Scarlett, loved Rhett all along.) is amazing. However, the last part, Part V, moves a bit fast. But I suppose you can't dwell on 12 years worth of dialogue and narrative...I would recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys a historical novel. Although this book has been known since its publication as a romance, I would say that Gone With the Wind is anything but a modern romance--it is the epitome of what a romance SHOULD be.",
            "Gone With the Wind is one of those books that for years I've been telling myself I really should read, but other books just kept getting in the way. I finally decided pick it up, and couldn't put it down once I started it. It's such a wonderful story, and the ending is one of the best endings I've ever read in a book. The book is so much more than just a romance. I really wish Mitchell had written a sequel, because I would love to know what happens next to Scarlett (I know there are a few sequels out there by other authors, but to me that just isn't the same..I won't be reading them).One thing that was very hard for me to take was the extreme racism in the book. Of course, reading a book set in the South during slavery times and you know at least some of the characters will be racist. What surprised me though was how it is very apparent that Mitchell was very racist as well, and wasn't afraid to make her feelings about blacks and the South in general known. I really had to mentally block out some of Mitchell's attitudes in order to fully enjoy the book. At one point--around page 600, when Mitchell is describing the Restoration--I nearly had to set the book aside; it upset me so much. I'm glad I didn't though, because it is a great story, and one that will stay with me forever.",
            "The color red. It usually represents blood or love. However, Margaret Mitchell uses a little bit of both meanings in her description of Scarlett O'Hara, protagonist of Gone with the Wind. Scarlett represents two of the most powerful human emotions: love and hate. Gone with the Wind is truly classic American literature, as it encompasses such strong emotions and redefines the reader's historical understanding.It is hard to describe the level of feeling one gets from reading this book. Mitchell has loaded her story from cover to cover with strong details that take the reader on an intense voyage of human emotion. The reader can easily become involved in the story through this detail. The feelings Scarlett has for Ashley draw the reader back to his or her childhood. As Scarlett matures throughout the course of the novel, so too does the reader. Love, hate, anger and sorrow are all common emotions everyone experiences, and Mitchell uses her words to draw out these emotions from her readers so that they can truly understand Scarlett's character.They say that history is always written from the winner's perspective. This novel counters that, as it tells the story of the South from the South's perspective. For example, it provides a new point of view on Sherman's march to the sea, showing the way the Southern cities were affected and the feelings of the people living in them. Because the events are familiar to the reader, they stick out and maintain the reader's interest.Gone with the Wind is a classic in American literature, and is a touching story of a young woman experiencing life. Her name reflects her various personality traits, and makes for an interesting story. Everyone should read this book, but make sure you have plenty of time, as it is quite a lengthy book. Also, while extremely touching and a fun read, it can be difficult at times due to the broken Southern used as dialogue. Despite these few drawbacks, the novel is highly recommended to anyone who enjoys curling up with a good book and becoming emotionally part of the story. It is a good story that reflects the many aspects found in the color red.",
            "I am 16 years old and finished Gone With The Wind a few months ago. This is the most amazing story I have ever had the pleasure to lay my eyes upon. I have had an obsession with Gone With The Wind for quite some time and I read anything and everything I can about this novel and the film, my all time favorite movie. This is an amazingly captivating novel. Margaret Mitchell is perhaps the greatest author in American history. She is a literary goddess and her timeless characters have left a huge impression upon me. People say that the greatest tragedy in literary history is Romeo and Juliet...I think not! When I finished reading Gone With The Wind I realized that those people were wrong...when Rhett leaves Scarlett after all of her pleading and apologizing...it is undescribable in human terminology. Mitchell's amazing recount of the Civil War, the Old South, and the lives that were touched by both is unparalleled in the history of recorded language...I have become ! extremely interested in the history of the Old South and the greatest American crisis-the Civil War. This novel is by far a literary phenomenon...it will never be equalled or surpassed! I feel priveleged to have been able to read this book and I thank Ms. Mitchell for writing this paramount spectacle.",
            "&quot; Un-put-a-downable.&quot; When I started reading this book, I completely lost track of time. I became so hooked on the romance between Scarlett and Rhett, I just thought about it for days and days. I convinced my friends to read it, and they were addicted to it also. The film Gone with the Wind is superb, I imagine Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable perfectly as the two! The descriptions and wit in the novel is unsurpassed, by the end of the novel I felt like I knew Scarlett &quot; down the her bones&quot;. Very few books made me laugh aloud, gasp, sigh, and cry--this is one of them. Every time I pass the book on my shelf. I want to read it again. Once you get started..it's hell to stop. The sequel is pretty good, I just needed more of Rhett and Scarlett to keep thinking of. I wish terribly that Margaret Mitchell had written more for us to eternally cherish. Bless that woman!",

            "\"Burdens are for shoulders strong enough to carry them\"Tara Plantation, near Jonesborough, near Atlanta, GeorgiaKatie \"Scarlett\" O'Hara is the most charming Southern belle, gathering the attention of beaux all over the surrounding areas. But when she learns the man she had been psuedo-courting, Ashley Wilkes, is marrying Melanie Hamilton from Atlanta, his cousin, she schemes to win him back. When he refuses, she immediately marries Charles Hamilton in spite. But Civil War has come to the South, and Scarlett quickly finds herself a widow, stuck in Atlanta, with a child, unable to be the pretty belle she had been a few months prior. Will Scarlett ever get Ashley? What about the strange Rhett Butler character, who is constantly tweaking her? Will Scarlett and her family survive the war?Let me preface my review with this: I don't read a lot of historical fiction or chick lit or romance or anything. My speciality is science fiction, fantasy, and urban fantasy. However, this book absolutely, positively blew me away!At first, I found the novel a bit slow. There were so many characters, and at first, it seemed like nothing happened. But that wasn't to last. Quickly, I became interested in Scarlett's schemes to snatch Ashley away from Melanie, all the while hating her for her bad behavior. By the end of the book, there were points were I was in near tears.Scarlett wasn't my favorite character. She was a rude, bitter, selfish woman. But I completely understood her predicament. To the reader, she was completely honest, despising her first husband's death (and life!), her dislike of children (don't see that much in romance do we!), her dislike of women's poor station (always having to act \"silly\" in front of the menfolk), and taking the reigns of business to make a life of her own. So while I didn't like her, I also didn't hate her. I understood what she was trying to do and found myself rooting for her against the odds. She is a brilliantly written character, so dynamic, multifaceted and full.Melanie Hamilton was probably my favorite character. This might seem odd as she does come off as a Mary Sue--perfect and sweet to everyone, always right, yada, yada--and I hate Mary Sues. But I really never found Melanie a Mary Sue. Scarlett repeatedly downplays Melanie's beauty. Melanie is strong-willed and works diligently, but tires easily (such as when she works at Tara in the cotton fields). Like Scarlett, Melanie was definitely not a 1-D character. She appeared weak on the outside, while maintaining strenght in the face of danger, in the face of childbirth, in the face of hard times. She was a true inspiration to me.Rhett Butler made me so furious, sometimes I wanted to slap him like Scarlett! But other times, he was so charming and debonair, that I wanted to melt in his arms like butter. I loved how forthright he was, how practical and realistic he was, and yet how at times, his passionate nature came through (joining the Confederate army at the end, for example).Side characters, such as Miss Pittypat, Mammy, Dilcey, Pork, Uncle Peter, Mrs. Meade, Belle Watling, and more, jumped out at me. They felt like real people, people influenced by dreams, desires, and feelings. Probably one of the sweetest moments was when Dr. and Mrs. Meade were talking and she mentioned she would rather him be at Belle's than dead. Given what Mrs. Meade had been through, what she held dear, it was particularly poignant.I could go on endlessly about the amazing life lessons and themes and symbols in the book. Quotes about the status of women at the time, about changing with the changing times, about strength of character, about being who you are, and about what is really important in life abound in this book. Most of the ones that really touched me may be found on my profile page, though the whole book is brimming with it.As this deals with the South during the Civil War, there is much talk of slavery; one of the reasons, I believe, it has been so frequently placed on the Banned Books list. Some people believe that it shows slavery in a favorable light, that blacks were/are children that need to be tended by whites. My opinion is this: it shows how many white Southern plantation owners viewed slaves. Not all slave owners were Mr. Simon Legree of Uncle Tom's Cabin. Conversely, not all slave owners are like the O'Hara's. Yes, there are a lot of black stereotypes (Mammy, Prissy, etc.), but this is a snapshot into the past. You can't take this book and try to force modern views of civil rights and racism into it. However, I do believe it makes a brilliant discussion piece: comparing Scarlett and other Southern whites' views of blacks with other accounts (such as Uncle Tom's Cabin or the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn).All in all, this is a brilliant book, made more excellent by the narrator, who deftly interprets the Southern dialect and accents for the listener. I thoroughly enjoyed it and was heart-broken, but inspired, when it ended. I highly recommend, even to those, like me, who aren't big into historical fiction.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*",
            "This book was virtually transferring me back into time like a time machine..you live the book, you feel the book, you \"see\" the book..you are there..with Scarlett, Rhett, Mammy, Melanie, and Ashley..unbelievably emotional at all extremes..I love it and will be glad to re-read it.",
            "When I first picked up Gone with the Wind, it seemed impossibly large. However, halfway through the second page, I began noticing that the words were flying by, and my world was slowly grinding to a halt. Everything stopped so I could continue reading. The book was absolutely enthralling. The chemistry and romance between Rhett and Scarlett was so incredibly well written that I could see sparks flying out of their eyes, and here the firecrackers crackling as they traded insults. Even if they didnt know that they were perfect for eachother, we knew. After reading this book, I have come to the conclusion that, not only is Margaret Mitchell a phenomenal American writer, but she also is one of the best people to describe the South during and around the Civil War time period. She completely deserved the Pultizer Prize that she won, and I will continue to pass on the message about this amazing book. Such an archetypal novel should be timeless; it will never die out or become obsolete.",
            "well, ok, the cover looks like a romance novel and i wouldnt be caught dead without some kind of a dust jacket.it was very engaging and a fast read though its size can be daunting. with colorful discreptions, wonderful prose and excllient character development it is well worth the time it takes to finish it. it's one of the few books i would say is much better than the movie. you'll be glad you read it.",
            "Originally, I fell in love with the movie. The book is the same characters but weaves a deeper story rich in language, history and description. Mitchell's love of Atlanta and knowledge of the South makes this novel so inviting. Don't let the length be offsetting this book reads itself it flows so smoothly.",
            "I would give this 10 stars if I could. I haven't read this since I was a young girl in the early 70's and should never have waited so long to read it again. The characters were exceptionally well drawn, the dialogue was brilliant, particularly between Rhett (SIGH!) and Scarlett. I swear there was sparks flying off the pages. I am going to miss the people I will have to put behind me now that the book has come to an end, Rhett (SIGH), Scarlett, Mammy, Prissy and Aunt Pitty Pat (LOL).The author's use of prose was beautiful, all the scenes and action came alive for me. Some people seem to be offended by the racism in the book, but that's how things were back then. Sugar coating it would have ruined the story reducing it to a Harlequin romance.This is an incredibly well written book about the death of a civilization and the struggles to survive in the new era. This is a book that should not be missed, particulary those who enjoy historical fiction.",
            "I actually discorved Gone with the Wind when I was eleven, and it is an interesting story. I was in a race against a classmate to find the longest book in the school library, read it, and pass the test on it before she did. I read it, wondered why they put a book like that in an elementary school, took the test, passed and basked in the glory or beating someone. But when it was time to return my copy to the library I was disappointed, and renewed it three times until the librarian made me give it back. Then, months later I was visiting my grandmother (she lived in Texas, I in Nebraska) and noticed that she had a copy of the book (with a sticker on the front that said 50 cents.). I took it out of the shelf and started to read it, and when my grandma found me reading it, she said she never liked it and gave it to me. Bam. Love at first page. I read it three times and got the sequel from the public library (not bad, but it will never compare to the original), and saw both the GWTW movie and the 'Scarlett' miniseries, before I was twelve.I am always reading Gone with the Wind. My old copy is hidden away somewhere, but I bought myself a new one in slightly better condition. I am in ove with this book. I read it late at night every singe night, and when I finish the book I instantly start again. I have yet to find any book by any author that could possibly stand up to this novel. To anyone to is considering this book but can't decide-buy this book. The money you pay for this piece of writing will be the most well-spent money you've ever given for a book. This is an unforgettable tale with two of the greatest characters of all time. Need I say more?",
            "I have had this book in my library for well over 10 years. I often picked it up, but never began to read it. I knew of all the hype about this being the great American epic novel and a Pulitzer Prize winner. I had seen the movie twice. The first time when I was maybe 8 when I saw it with my grandparents. The only thing I remember was asking my grandfather, \"Why is grandma crying?\" The second time I saw it, maybe five years ago, I was deeply disappointed in its lack of realism. Today's movies of blood and gore made the battle scenes and the long bloodless dolly shot of the wounded soldiers lying on the ground in Atlanta look plastic and fake. Another reason I neglected to read this book: 1024 pages. But, finally I decided to give it a shot, and am I glad I did. It is difficult to find the proper superlatives to use here. One plus, because of my busy schedule I had to read this in fits and starts, and it took over two months. However, author Mitchell has given us such strong and descriptive characters and has given so much detail to all of the plot twists and turns, that it was easy to return to the book and have complete remembrances of what has happened in the preceding pages. The story is compelling. Scarlett is a complex and fascinating heroine; Rhett her perfect antagonist. The minor characters all are well drawn. From the battle scenes, the aftermath, the period of reconstruction, what we have here is history come alive. I will cherish the hours I spent with this book. As a result, I will now search for a biography of Ms. Mitchell to learn why this was the only book this magnificent author ever wrote.",
            "I haven't been so engrossed in a book in a while. That's not to say I haven't read any good books lately, but there are some novels that take you hostage, laying siege to your thoughts until you can't think of anything else. You turn every single page, devouring them one by one. When it's over, you've ingested it and the story sticks inside you. It becomes so much a part of you that it's like looking through an old lens at something that happened to you a long time ago.Scarlett O'Hara has been forever ingrained in my brain as someone to aspire never to be like and someone to admire. She is completely oblivious to people and how they work-hurting feelings and breaking hearts-but she has gumption and ambition, which is admirable. Margaret Mitchell masterfully crafts a protagonist that is a completely different person on page 1,448 than she was on page 1, but still fundamentally the same. It's a brilliant blend of changing times and societies, a history lesson, a love story, a tragedy, and most of all a story of a person's capacity for change. I actually feel like there is nothing more I can say about this novel to do it justice.So, I suggest to anyone and everyone to read this book and not to be intimidated by the page count. It is honestly one of the best stories I've ever read; there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that this is rightly deemed a classic novel.",
            "I am a native Georgian, and I cannot believe I waited so long to read Gone With the Wind. Pat Conroy's new introduction finally got me to pick it up, and it simply is one of the best books I have ever read. It is magnificent. Winner of the Pulitzer Prize, it is a snapshot of a conquered nation and people - right here in the United States - and how they survive and persevere in the face of changing times, a lost war, and overwhelming odds.If your only exposure to Gone With the Wind is the film, you have so much more to discover. There are many important differences between the book and the film. ***SPOILER ALERT*** The book has many colorful characters sacrificed for the movie - Will Benteen, a Confederate Veteran who ends up running Tara and marrying one of Scarlett's sisters, Mrs. Tarleton (mother of the twins), Honey Wilkes (Ashley's sister), Uncle Henry Hamilton (Melanie and Charles' uncle), Dilcey (wife of Pork), and the much more fleshed out Aunt Pittypat and Belle Watling, just to name a few. In the book Scarlett has three children, one by each of her three husbands, instead of just Bonnie as portrayed in the film. Another major difference between the book and the film is that Rhett's motivations, background, and depth of feeling (and incredible suffering) comes through in the book in much more detail. In addition, by the end of the book I had a great affection for the quiet forgiveness, intelligence and iron-clad strength of Melanie that I felt was a bit lost in the film. Melanie truly is one of literature's greatest \"steel magnolias.\" ***END OF SPOILERS***I was very interested to read of Gone With the Wind's popularity overseas. It has been reported that the book has been translated into 40 foreign languages in 50 countries. It is amazingly popular in Japan, and in Germany more than 360,000 copies were sold by July 1941. I had never thought about it before, but Gone With the Wind was written during the late 1920's and 1930's about survival in the American south during and after the Civil War, at the same time Germany was suffering and rebuilding from its defeat in World War I. The European resistance movement during World War II found so much inspiration in the south's reaction to the Federal occupation in Gone With the Wind that the book was bootlegged during the war by the French Underground and other organizations. Orders actually went out from Germany at one point during World War II to \"seize all copies.\"During and after World War II people in rebuilding countries took the story of Gone With the Wind to heart. Margaret Mitchell stated, \"In practically every European country critics wrote at length of the 'universal historical significance.' Each nation applied to its own past history the story of the Confederate rise and fall and reconstruction. French critics spoke of 1870 (the Franco-Prussian War), Poles of the partitioning of their country, Germany of 1918 and the bitterness which followed, Czechs wrote not only of their troubled past but of their fears of the future, and I had letters from that country just before it went under (Nazi domination), saying that if the people of the South had risen again to freedom the people of Czechoslovakia could do likewise.\"The worldwide legacy of Gone With the Wind is truly astounding, and it all began right here in the Atlanta area with this book. Do not be put off by the book's size. Gone With the Wind is a real barn burner, and there is not a dull moment in the entire story. It is dramatic, brutal, romantic, amazingly intelligent, and quite shocking even by today's standards. The pages literally fly by. Read the first two chapters and if you are like me you will not be able to put it down. Margaret Mitchell's storytelling ability is an amazing thing to behold.Very highly recommended.",
            "This was my first read of \"Gone with the Wind\" and have to say it is by far some of the most vivid visual writing style I've encountered. The period style of writing and language used to describe scenery, events, people, class, style, emotions and action are simply riviting.Simply put: read the book.",
            "This was my first time reading this classic and I really didn't know what to expect. I had seen the movie version several times and in my opinion I really enjoyed the book so much more (Although the movie earns it's own merit's). It left me speechless and it really made me think about what Scarlett O'Hara had been through and it really made me for feel her and the other characters in the story. I was really impressed with the story Margaret Mitchell created. I can see why this got the Pulitzer Prize in 1937. If this has to be the book you choose for your next read, make it this one for sure!",
            "I read this book about 20 years ago, I am so glad I read again! Scarlett was ahead of her time and a very strong woman. Follow this book with the new Rhett Butler's People which I found very interesting.",
            "This is a new copy of an old favorite that I read to death. Have not read this one yet, but, I am sure that I will enjoy it as much as the other one.",
            "What a masterpiece! Enjoyed every chapter. Details in the book most interesting that were left out of the movie. Margaret Mitchell was a genius.",
            "I knew this book was a classic so I figured I would like the book. I didn't like it, I loved it. It took me three weeks to read but I still couldn't put it down. It kept me hooked to the end. I didn't know what to expect but it is a classic. Scarlett was a woman that was becoming modern but people and the times did not want it. I love her for what she did in the book and stood up for herself. The movie is as just as good as the book.",
            "This is a review YEARS in the making. First, I saw the movie on TV - bought the DVD and watch it at least once a year. Whenever I think of GWTW, I visualize Scarlett and her father at the oak tree at sunset...as the music swells. I enjoyed the story of a strong woman who truly believes that she is only trying to do her best for her family. Now. I said all that, to say this: the movie is nothing compared to the book! The book fleshes out the characters, life in the deep south, and the civil war. The book is long,yes, but there are no gratuitous descriptors - every word adds to your understanding of the people, the time, and the politics. After having the movie 'in my head' for so many years, believing that it was the story - I was delighted to find so much more in the book. I now read the book about once a year. This book is a must read for anyone whoever saw the movie; and for anyone looking for a real novel!",
            "If you read GWTW strictly as a love story,you're missing part of the picture,and I'm saying this as someone who DID read it as a love story many years ago at the age of twelve. And I don't mean just the surface historical picture either.It goes so much deeper.Scarlett is of course the central character,and to me,a metaphor for the \"New South\",in that she compromises with the new circumstances in order to survive.Melanie appeared to me as a symbol of the \"Old South\"-but the part of it that had integrity and strength.They needed each other in order to survive,and it took Scarlett until the end of the book to realise this.Ashley is the part of the Old South that couldn't adjust.Rhett is the person who though he despised the old ways and all they stood for until age and time made him begin to realise what he had thrown away.He still had a cynicism about it,but he also had an appreciation for the charm of a time that would never be again.As with many others,Scarlett was my favorite character in my first few readings,but I came to a new appreciation of Melanie over time. I began to see that she had a true quiet strength that Scarlett could never approach,one that didn't require her to compromise her principles and her loyalty,as Scarlett had to,in order to survive. The character of Ashley,on many further readings,doesn't appear quite as pathetic as before(though I never found him THAT pathetic in the first place).He was simply,as he tragically recognised,an anachronism in his time,a beautiful dream which evaporated under the harsh glare of a new reality.He was the part of the dream that Scarlett clung to,even as she clung to the ideal of her mother Ellen,never seeing the truth of these ideals-the honor,strength,and integrity of the dream,rather than the outward forms.This was HER tragedy-even though she was a survivor of a kind,she had to destroy all that was good in order to do so.Melanie had the true moral courage that allowed her to survive without destroying the good-to me,a much more difficult kind of survival.I'll need to read this book so many more times before I'll feel finally understand it all,if I ever will.I understand the old story,being born and raised in the South,of the struggle to hold on to your identity and still be a part of the world around you.I understand why The War can feel like yesterday-after all, most of it was fought on the soil here,and the losers always remember longer.I think the background of Scarlett's father,Gerald O'Hara from Ireland,neatly ties into this.Read and re-read this book,because everytime you do you'll find depths you didn't plumb before.There is so much symbolism to be explored,each reading will provoke new thoughts.",
            "Perhaps because it was made into a hit movie, this book is sometimes considered a &quot;romance novel&quot; instead of great literature. It is, in fact, one of the great American novels. Mitchell does not portray the antebellum South as an ideal but rather a doomed society, like the &quot;Tara&quot; of Irish myth. The characters are thoroughly developed and complex. A must read for anyone interested in the Civil War, women in fiction, and American literature.",
            "I absolutely loved Gone With the Wind. I read over the summer because it was one of the choices on my school reading list and my mother and sister had read it and loved it. I didnt expect to like it all that much, but I was hooked after the first ten pages. It has become my favorite book. I couldn't stop thinking about it when I finished. I have reread it at least three times, and I am still left with the same feeling I had the first time. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. I would give it ten stars if I could.",
            "I am sure that there are thousands who share the same feeling - there cudn't have been a more realistic &amp; close to heart character portayal than that done by Mitchell. One has to read the book to understand how it can affect a person. I am sure no female ever gets over Rhett Butler (not even when her hair has turned gray - example my English literature teacher at school) and no man can resist Scarlett's charms (they are in the same boat as that of other fictitious characters in this epic).A must read.",
            "&iexcl;Gone with the Wind&iexcl; is my all-time favorite novel. I&iexcl;m so obsessed with the book that I think about it every day, in spite that I&iexcl;ve read it for like a hundred times. I cannot tell why I cannot get enough of the book. I&iexcl;ve been trying to tell myself that it&iexcl;s just a book of 1000 pages, telling the story of a belle&iexcl;s maturity and struggles for living, yet I just can&iexcl;t cut off my bond with it.Due to the colorful plot and intriguing dialogues, my opinion about it changes with time. As I first read it during junior high, I viewed it as a moving love story. Oddly, there was a time that I really hated the novel because it inevitably posed discrimination on African Americans. Nevertheless, my love for it was resurrected on my way of learning to grow up, for I highly respect the female main character, Scarlett O&iexcl;hara&iexcl;s courage and passion for living. Above all, I can always get something from reading the book.With its vivid description, I can picture a broad land, a luxurious house, people&iexcl;s looks in my mind. Though the novel is already pretty lengthy, still some parts were unsaid, leaving to readers&iexcl; imagination. I guess that&iexcl;s one of the reasons that make the book so catchy and unforgettable. With its classic movie version, it&iexcl;s amazing that my thoughts about it remain unaffected.The book is generally true to its historic background, and since the author depicts female mind profoundly, I can easily comprehend the idea she tried to convey or the metaphors. When Scarlett is happy or heart-broken, it seems like I&iexcl;m just there on the scene, feeling the trouble or pleasure she is confronted with. And it&iexcl;s one of the few books that make women respectable and independent, causing me to identify with it even more.I won&iexcl;t deny the fact that I&iexcl;m an incurable fan of the novel. It enriches my life and somehow glorifies my imagination. I will follow the strong determination the book suggests: &iexcl;Never ever give up!&iexcl;",
            "Gone with the Wind is a wonderful book. I just finished reading it a few days ago and I was blown away.I loved and hated Scarlett .Even though the ending is heartwrenching, Scarlett took Rhett for granted and she'll get him back somehow, she always gets what wants. Up until I read this book I never realized how rough it was for the south during and after the Civil War.This is a must read, if the book doesn't interest you now, try it again later, that's what I did.!",
            "I cannot describe how great this book was. It was the best book I ever read and I know I will read it more than once. Gone with the Wind had such a charm to it that is bound to sweep you off your feet. If want a book that gets you hooked in the first line of &quot;Scarlett O'Hara was not beautiful, but men seldon realized it when caught by her charms, as the Tarleton twins were&quot; to the last lines of this heart-wrenching book, then this book is a sure way to be enveloped. It tells of the southern life during the Civil War. Even if you aren't interested in history, like I am not, you can still be sure you will love it. I recommend this book to anyone who has patience and who loves Love-stories.",
            "Gone with the wind was the best book I have ever read. It is utterly captivating. Scarlett, the main character in the book, is someone that everyone should strive to be unlike, but secretly, throughout the whole book, you are rooting for her. Even at the stupidest things, you cry when Scarlett feels distraught. It will come deep into your soul and play with you emotions until all you can do is focus all your energy into reading this book. From the beginning to the end, you won't be able to put it down. It is a great (and sometimes quite graphic) display of what the civil war does to people and their beings. You will not regret reading this book, in any way shape or form. It is the most tantalizing book you will ever read. It is a great love story of desperate unrequited love and of hidden emotions that never show themselves until; it is unfortunately, too late. Everyone should have the experience of reading a book that is so magical that you really will never forget the way you felt through each amazing chapter. It is a must read for people over the age of ten. It will make you blood curdle and go cold at almost the same instant. Don't pass up the opportunity to read this book about the infamous love triangle of Scarlett O'Hara, Rhett Buttler, and Ashley Wilks. Never again will you find a book so worthwhile.",
            "Are you looking for a book that will be refused to put down? Then you may have just hit the ultimate jackpot;Gone with the Wind is a flurry of different themes that come together in one book,each of which beckon the reader to follow word after word to the last period.From romance to adventure, this book brilliantly entwines descriptions that come alive and stir emotions from deep in your heart.The author,Margaret Mitchell, carefully picks out her characters to make a rather interesting and unique combination that make this novel come to life.Join Scarlett O'Hara,the once pampered belle of the County,as she fights to regain her old life's treasures after the destructive effects the Civil War.Some will be frustrated,others,left melancholy,but the outcome of this beloved story is guaranteed to be breathtaking,one way or another.",
            "There will never be another book to match the greatness of \"GONE WITH THE WIND\". No matter how many times I read it and re-read it I have always falling prey to it's spell of great reading. I don't care for other people who have a fanatical hatred for this book. It seems sad that these people who call this great classic racist are also the same people saying that the South deserved what it got and the southern people too got what they desereved. How can they even suggest such a thing? The killing of civilians, the pillaging, the murder of whole families and black ex-slaves, the stealing of homes, the burning of whole towns, civil liberties taking away when the south and it's people were doing their best to start again and be part of the Union again after the war, martial law being the order of the day for over five years, the robbing of state government money, over taxation again for the South and it's people after the war and after taxes being one of primary reasons for the the war, the murder of many more man and their families for being defiant against a Government that lied to them again, and all is being condoned by people who live now in the present who say the Southern people deserved what they got for having slaves and daring to follow what the Consitution allowed? the right of session. Do these people not know the law? history and American governmentworkins?, and the right of session being an American and constitutional right?. How sad. Gone With The Wind is a book. A great book. The story of Scarlett O'Hara and her fight to never be hungry again, her fight to never let the Yankees beat her, and her fight to keep Tara her land from the Yankees. Scarett is a role model for anyone who will do anything to survive when the time comes to keep from being poor. Whether she is spoiled, caculating, and shrewed or just plain mean she gets what she wants, just like I think she would have gotten Rhett back sooner or later. Or Rhett would have come back. He loved her too much and waited to long for her to just give her up easily. Remember how he waited till the burning of Atlanta to enlist in the Cause to save the Condfederacy, of course he would have returned back to her in the end. And for all the people who think slavery was the only issue pertaining to the civil war. Read your history. Not public school history or present history. Read real history before 1970. You'll get the history you were robbed from. Remember slavery was legal so that made it okay in the eyes of the law before the Civil War. It was legal. It didn't make it right. Abraham Lincoln too said he wasn't sending troops South to end slavery, he was sending troops to end the Antebellum South.",
            "Gone with the Wind, by Margaret Mitchell, is a stunning book which is sure to hold readers enthralled. Embark on an exciting journey, following the flirtatious Scarlett O'Hara, dashing blockade runner Rhett Butler, sweetness personified Melanie Hamilton, and the wistful Ashley Wilkes. Scarlett has always been a petulant, coquettish, southern belle. But too soon, the Civil War strikes, and Scarlett's perfect world shatters around her. Her beloved Ashley is married to Melly, a girl Scarlett feels is the perfect example of boredom. During the tragic, bloody years of the Civil War, the sardonic Rhett Butler enters Scarlett's life. This stunning book is not only a historical melodrama, but also a book that reflects the human heart and shows how Scarlett can change from a selfish person to a strong woman.",
            "This book is another world that I lose myself in while reading it. I get so involved with the story and plot that when Scarlett is dismal, I am dismal. When Scarlett is defiant, I am defiant. This book never fails to move me. While some people see it as a racist pledge to the Confederacy, I see it as the key to how the South felt about the war, about the Reconstruction, about life...",
            "Read this book. And then read the sequel by Alexandra Ripley. Gone with the Wind is THE BEST! Beautiful, witty, definitly involved. What I love about these two books is that I became the character. I had read about her so much that I knew her inside and out, and I like books that do that for me. Margaret Mitchell is truly amazing and Alexandra Ripley did an outstanding recreating Scarletts life.",
            "I first read this book at the age of ten and have re-read it at least 15 times over the last decade. With each reading, I admire Mitchell's characters more and more. Mitchell's pen has an unerring eye for the telling detail. Aside from Rhett and Scarlett's stormy love, I think one of the most complex and fascinating relationships in the book is that of Scarlett and Melanie. Although Scarlett thinks she hates Melanie, she really depends on her as a substitute mother, and whether she realizes it or not, her actions towards Melanie are truly generous and good. Melanie, for her part, seems to worship Scarlett almost to the point of idolatry, and from the Twelve Oaks Barbecue scene until her death at the end of the book, never ceases protecting Scarlett from her detractors - just like Ellen O'Hara. Melanie is the only person who can ease Scarlett's anxiety about her fog nightmares other than Rhett. One of the most tragic things about the story is that when Scarlett fina! lly realizes just how much she loves and needs Melanie and Rhett, they are both lost to her on the same day. I've always wished that Mitchell had written a second volume (the Ripley book is wretched!), although I myself don't really see how Scarlett could get Rhett back, and there are no other people in her life who could take Melanie's place. Mitchell's story is both inspirational - Scarlett offers many lessons on how to cope with adversity, sorrow, and loss - and a magnificent exploration of the complexities of the human heart and mind. Each time I read this book I almost forget where I am and what else I should be doing. Margaret Mitchell was a great storyteller. I wish this book was longer.",
            "This is an incredible book! I found it extremely hard to put down. Margaret Mitchell guids you through all of the human emothions with this one. I is a griping novel about this civil war and it truely shows you what a horrible thing war is. Although I have not had that much time to read many books I can easily say that this book is the best I have ever read. I would esily give it 6 stars!",
            "When I picked up this book, I expected a long romance novel about a woman and her lover. What I read kept me up until 3 a.m. trying to finish it in one sitting. I would reccommend it to anyone. The one star I removed was due to the fact that it sometimes became confusing, with all of the marriages and deaths. I loved it. I severely do NOT reccommend to ANYONE the sequel, Scarlett.",
            "This book, Gone With the Wind, was so beautifully written that it seemed like the characters came off the page. Scarlett was not just someone from a book, but actually someone who lived.The book was the tale of Scarlett O'Hara from when she was 16 till she was 28. At the beginning of the book, Scarlett, daughter of a wealthy plantation owner, is in love with Ashley Wilkes. But Ashley is to marry his timid cousin Melanie Hamilton. Scarlett is very upset, but ends up marrying Charles Hamilton, Melanie's (also timid) brother to hurt Ashley. But war starts, and the men go off. Scarlett starts to realize that the war isn't just an exciting, little game, and she meets Rhett Butler. During the siege of Atlanta, I held my breath, anxious to see what was next. Scarlett ends up marrying twice again and has 3 children Wade, Ella, and Bonnie.Excellent book! The movie was great too, though it left out some things. But if you want to read more details than the movie, read the book.",
            "Although this is the longest book I've ever read in my life (1024 pages in my edition), it wasn't long enough, and it never could be. I loved this book, and now that I've read it all i can say is that I'm glad there's a sequel. From the first few paes the book catches the readers and and wraps them up in it's pages, carrying them along with the life of Scarlett O'hara. We laugh with her, cry with her, feel her her emotions as if they were our own. You cannot stop thinking about the book, even though your mind should be on other things. The only desire is to keep reading and find out more, until the book finally lets go. Then the reader is left alone and confused, wondering what has happened, and where the story has gone. The book is a masterpiece, a novel in perfection, and my only regret is that this scale only goes from one to ten, for Gone With The Wind deserves a 100.",
            "First and foremost, Gone with the Wind has no mundane narratives, heartwarming and heart-rending from page 1 to 1448, 1448 was not enough!Brace thyself to be swept away by the Old South. If you heard this is a novel which glorifies racism and the age of slavery, you are misinformed; magnanimity is quite a virtue fellow savant.A captivating theme supported by characters with character, what more dost thou needeth? GWTW is a Pre-Civil War novel which portrays the monstrous adversities Southerners were manhandled to weather upon the slaughter of their civilization and way of life. For those attempting to prevail over a disheartening tragedy, GWTW shall inspire thee to walk the path of Rhett Butler or Scarlett O'Hara, for it once had for I (I, a former Ashley), though I held onto my chimerical nature. Wikipedia relays an excellent analysis of the characters, better than my own.People believe Southerners were fighting to defend slavery and the Confederacy, and I am sure a number of the arrogant wealthy landowners were, but the majority of Southerners were simply defending their homes and those they love. What would you do if an army was en route to your town and will pillage, burn, and commit unspeakable horrors unto your town's women, welcome 'em with open arms? Unlikely, unless you are gutless or a damn fool. You would, like I, commit monstrous acts to all extents, even if it were to leave you a corpse. I can go into historical detail debunking many fallacies people have about those who fought for the Confederacy, but it would serve little purpose, try reading the quote at the end of this review. GWTW is a Pulitzer Prize winner, it is doubtful that it would have been awarded such an honor if it were based on a horde of slack-jawed yokels praising slavery. GWTW is a novel of epic proportions, I highly recommend it.The 1939 film cannot compare in depth to the novel itself, but it is damn good for 1939. Clark Gable's performance was praiseworthy, such fiery passion, and Vivien Leigh, wow! What a powerhouse she is, almost intimidating, but in a cute classy way, if that makes sense, especially when she says \"I will not listen-\" (p. 1306)Memorable scene:Scarlett: [pleads with Rhett as he is about to leave to join the Confederate Army] Oh, Rhett! Please, don't go! You can't leave me! Please! I'll never forgive you!Rhett Butler: I'm not asking you to forgive me. I'll never understand or forgive myself. And if a bullet gets me, so help me, I'll laugh at myself for being an idiot. There's one thing I do know... and that is that I love you, Scarlett. In spite of you and me and the whole silly world going to pieces around us, I love you. Because we're alike. Bad lots, both of us. Selfish and shrewd. But able to look things in the eyes as we call them by their right names.Scarlett: [struggles] Don't hold me like that!Rhett Butler: [holds her tighter] Scarlett! Look at me! I've loved you more than I've ever loved any woman and I've waited for you longer than I've ever waited for any woman.[kisses her forhead]Scarlett: [turns her face away] Let me alone!Rhett Butler: [forces her to look him in the eyes] Here's a soldier of the South who loves you, Scarlett. Wants to feel your arms around him, wants to carry the memory of your kisses into battle with him. Never mind about loving me, you're a woman sending a soldier to his death with a beautiful memory. Scarlett! Kiss me! Kiss me... once...[he kisses her]Random quote from Gettysburg (1993):\"Virginians! Virginians! For your lands! For your homes! For your sweethearts! For your wives! For...

            "I know, I know: another review of GWTW?Yes.Why? Because even after 72 years and billions of kudos, GWTW is still underrated. I was skeptical when I picked it up. But MM is one of the greatest writers of the 20th century, and she immediately hooks the reader. And she never lets up. And she spends the last third of the novel sucker-punching the reader over and over and over again, with each twist and turn more painful than the last. There's no one left to root for at the end of the book, and that's as it should be. Because it becomes clear that the characters in this novel (the adults, anyway) have all been playing a variety of dangerous games and, just like real life, they have to pay the price in the end.Scarlett is smart and courageous, but in the end she pays a price for her selfish behavior. Rhett is also smart and courageous, but at the end of the book he's a broken mess groping for his dignity and sanity. Melanie remains sane and dignified, but she's selfless to a fault (a characteristic which leads to her demise), and Ashley...well...This book makes me weep every time I read it. And yet I've read it at least 100 times. And keep coming back for more. Too bad all the sequels are so bad, but there's some fabulous fan fiction out there.",
            "I don't know if there is anything that Margaret Mitchell failed to put into this book. It is obvious that the author poured her entire being into this book and it is evident as you read that this story must have been very close to her heart as it always grabs hold of the hearts of countless readers. The book is written by an obvious historian and gives many details of the way of life of the people of the old south and the Civil War days as well. There is romance, a glimpse into the past, heartbreak, hope, triumph, struggle, life lessons, love, and the story of Scarlett O'Hara that will continue to live in the hearts of readers for generations to come. No matter what kind of books you like to read you will enjoy Gone with the Wind and take a piece of the book away with you for it never fails to leave one thinking about what the important things in life are.",
            "What a thumping good read! Unright-on and politically incorrect it may be, but frankly my dear... This book contains all things horrid - racism, slavery, going for your best friend's man (and your sister's!), cruelty to animals and unfortunates, deforestation, to name but a few. But so what? The characters are so strong they could be placed in any walk of life and flourish. OK, maybe not that insipid piscean-like Ashley Wilkes, but he should've been drowned at birth anyhow! How Scarlett could've been gagging for him for any longer than a couple of weeks is a mystery to me, but I guess he was a challenge (no wonder Rhett felt inadequate!). To be fair, the book does goes on a bit in parts, and I feel Margaret Mitchell could've employed her journalistic skills and been a little more succinct. There are a number of characters that I see no need for and having seen the film so many times, I believe she could have honed her dialogue more. But Mags is so much kinder to Scarlett than Victor Fleming is in the movie. On film Scarlett is portrayed as a ball-breaker - which to a certain extent she most commendably is! - whereas in the book we see her thought processes and we understand why she is like she is. She's a tough cookie who is simply unprepared to have nothing 'coz her contemporaries harp on about honour and the good old days. She's MOVIN'! Plus in the book we see a far darker Rhett than the role interpreted by Clark Gable. He's cool, he's a bad boy, he's loaded, but let's face it, the guy's got problems! He knew what he was getting into when he met Ms O'Hara, but he still pursued her for years. He's got some gall to turn round and moan that she isn't the way he wanted her to be, believing he could have changed her and made her love him. And then when she discovers it for herself... well Scarlett, the game's over! I'm not interested anymore. But hey, we still love him, he still packs a punch more than Frank, Charles and that stupid Ashley and he keeps you guessing. Does she get him back? Probably eventually. Scarlett has screwed up by being such a foolhardy hothead, but give her a break! With Melanie gone, she's got no pals and you know Scarlett will honour her promise and look out for Ashley... urgh! With any luck the man will get abducted by aliens and everyone can get on with their lives!",
            "Set in the Civil War era in Georgia, Margaret Mitchell's runaway classic Gone With the Wind is the spellbinding historical fiction of the world's best-known southern belle Scarlett O'Hara and the infamous Rhett Butler. The book was later made into one of the most successful films in history, starring Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable as the love-to-hate main characters. Normally, one would despise a person so spoiled and selfish as Scarlett, but Margaret Mitchell writes the emerald-eyed belle and the other characters in the book as multi-faceted, understandable characters, all with surprisingly human emotions and interactions. Through all of her struggles in the course of the novel, Scarlett stays strong, and in the end her will survives and she concludes a strong woman hopeful of what tomorrow will bring. Gone With the Wind is magnificent in its entirety, so complete with accurate historical facts and an unpredictable plot. The narrator follows Scarlett through years of her life, pre-, neo- and post- civil war, building at a quick pace. Scarlett rises again after the deaths of many close to her, after her failed marriage to Rhett, after going home to her beloved plantation of Tara during Reconstruction to find everything gone, and after her unrequited love for Ashley. The book closes with Scarlett pronouncing the famous words, &quot;After all, tomorrow is another day!&quot; Poignant and absolutely enchanting, Gone With the Wind is a book I would recommend to anyone. It cannot be guaranteed that you will enjoy it as I did, but from reading this novel you will gain insight about a true struggle and eventual survival.",
            "I recently downloaded the book, `Gone With The Wind' to my Kindle. It's not because I haven't read the book - far from it! Like millions of readers world-wide, I have already savoured every page of this best-selling listed book of all time in hardback, at least twice so far. I was 6 years old when my grandmother first noticed me looking intently at her copy of `Gone With The Wind' in her bookcase. And it was shortly after my grandmother passed away a few months later that the very same book was placed gently into my hands to keep (as was her request).There have been so many book reviews about `Gone With The Wind', authored by Margaret Mitchell, that I was almost tempted not to write this review. It seems somewhat pointless in repeating what has already been written countless times about this masterpiece, and the only book ever published by this author in 1936, who received a Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for it, in 1937. With over 30 million sales, a film, and sequel attempts by other authors in attempts to keep the `Gone With The Wind' saga alive, it is a book well known, world-wide.For those unfamiliar; set in the state of Georgia, southern United States in 1861, `Gone With The Wind' is the story of the high spirited, un-conforming southern belle Scarlett O'Hara and her tumultuous struggles of the heart, with (southern gentleman) Ashley Wilkes and (charming rogue) Rhett Butler. But it is not just a romance novel; it is also a novel bathed in American history, and the story of a young woman's determination and strength of will to save her beloved plantation home called Tara in any way possible, through times of the American Civil War and the early years of Reconstruction.I cannot recall why I was so captivated by this book when I looked at it on my grandmother's book shelf all those years ago (it did not have a colourful outside cover). I certainly wasn't at an age to fully comprehend the contents of it, despite the fact that as a child growing up in the Australian bush in the 1960's, reading was a huge part of my childhood, especially as my mother and grandmother were both teachers. However, once I read the book I realised that my grandmother would have known I would relate to Scarlett's love of the land; her home, Tara, which she fought to protect at any cost.My favourite excerpts:-Gerald O'Hara (Scarlett's father): `'Do you mean to tell me, Katie Scarlett O'Hara, that Tara, that land doesn't mean anything to you? Why, land is the only thing in the world worth workin' for, worth fightin' for, worth dyin' for, because it's the only thing that lasts.''\"Somewhere, on the long road that wound through those four years, the girl with her sachet and dancing slippers, had slipped away, and there was left a woman with sharp green eyes, who counted pennies and turned her hands to many menial tasks, a woman to whom nothing was left from the wreckage, except the indestructible red earth on which she stood.\"`Gone With The Wind' will appeal to readers for so many different reasons. I highly recommend it!J M Lennox",
            "Oh wow!! I was utterly and completely engrossed with this book. Mitchell did an incredible job on being very descriptive of everything. As I read I can really picture the scenery, the characters, and the war especially. Scarlet annoyed me and it was devastating how selfish, cruel, and cold hearted she was. Nevertheless, I couldn't put the book down. I was interested to see on what would become of her and Rhett, and Melanie and Ashley. The ending was a tear jerker for me especially for what happened to Melanie. The author did well on creating so much depth into this novel. Don't be intimidated by the long and many pages of this book. It was worth reading.",
            "Saying you know the story of \"Gone With the Wind,\" because you've seen the movie is like saying you know Kansas from watching \"The Wizard of Oz.\" Compressed and with composite characters, the brilliant movie doesn't hold a candle to the novel upon which it is based. The novel has undergone much criticism, for black dialect (which we studied, along with other dialects in History of the English Language), for rosy portrayals of slavery, and for being a forbidden romance that happens to have the Civil War as its background.\"Gone With the Wind,\" is more than a novel; it is an experience. Scarlett O'Hara is devout with faith---in herself, and is a survivor. The true tragedy of the book is that she is blinded by her ignorance into ignoring true love when it was present, and longing after an idealized love with a married friend. The book is lush with descriptions of the period, and very accurate in its detail. Scarlett is externally strong, with fragile emotions, while her foil Melanie Hamilton Wilkes is internally strong, with character and devotion that run deep. Ashley Wilkes is rather pathetic in that he never has the integrity to admit a lust for his childhood friend Scarlett but not romantic love, while Rhett, in many ways like Scarlett, and older and wiser, loves her for who she really is, not the face that society of the time demands she show in public. The story is mostly about character development in the face of tragedy, and shows three survivors with one \"displaced person,\" forever malcontent in the new world that the War has created, out of place, sad, and futile.A word about the slavery element: slavery was NOT a good thing. Not all slaves were named after their owners or treated as trusted members of the family or confidantes. Aside from Rhett, Mammy is the only person who knows Scarlett, what she is capable of, and chastises her for her lack of morals or values. I feel her character is critiqued based upon her speech patterns, not her actual actions. With the exception of Prissy, none of the African-Americans appear to be ridiculed or used for comic effect, nor do stereotypes surface. Pork, Dilcey, Mammy, and Prissy are fortunate that the emotional ties they shared with the O'Haras continued so much that they remain as paid staff after being freed. Cruelty from others is also depicted, usually in the form of Northerners who didn't understand the way of life.What remains is a tale of what happens when one's way of life and world are turned upside down, and how the principal character handles it, and relates with the others, failing at times to recognize the quality of friendship from her sister-in-law Melanie and the weakness of Ashley Wilkes. I quite wonder if Mittie Bulloch Roosevelt felt this way, when the enchanting Clayton County belle (from whom some of Scarlett's physical traits seem drawn) moved to New York State with new husband Theodore Roosevelt, Sr.While not all elements of the novel are positive, GWTW is a snapshot album of life during the Civil War and Reconstruction.",
            "In my humble opinion, Gone with the Wind is THE great American novel. It is brilliant, incredibly well-written, and highly enjoyable to read. It is at times charming, romantic, or bitingly funny, and at other times dark, cold, or heartbreaking. And always, it has the Civil War-era history as its dramatic backdrop. Its characters are fascinating and complex, though FAR from perfect. This book has everything, and its appeal is timeless.I first read the book as a young girl, after a couple of friends at school has been reading it and were enthralled by it when we were all about 13. I read it starting one Christmas break, and could hardly put it down. It's such a long epic, yet so fast-paced, that you just become lost in it. That's the very best way to enjoy a novel- to just become fully engrossed. The way it worked out for me was perfect too, because when I read it that first time, I had never seen the movie. (My parents had probably watched it a few times when I was little, since they love the movie, but I was too young to pay much attention). I knew nothing about the characters or storyline before reading it, and that just made it all the better. Of course, at that age I loved Rhett Butler and the love story aspect the most! Some of it was over my head or too \"worldy\" for me to understand then. Realizing this, I have since read the book again as an adult (I'm now in my late 20's and have seen the movie several times also). I loved the book just as much as the first time around, and certainly as an adult I got much more out of the historical elements, descriptions of the countryside, and the whole storyline.I would really encourage anyone who has only seen the movie to read the book. I do love the movie; It was incredible for its time, and is a classic itself; but to me it doesn't even compare to the book. Just watching the movie, you only get a sense of the most shallow outline of the story, without understanding much of its depth, character development, or wit. This is especially true in the second half, which was a bit rushed in the movie.A slight pet peeve of mine: Some people comment on Gone With the Wind being \"racist\" or \"sexist,\" as if that somehow detracts from its quality. Quite the contrary...Not only is that overstating the obvious, that's part of the point!! OF COURSE the characters' racist viewpoints were condescending and horrible. But they were historically realistic. The entire nation of the 19th century was shamelessly racist, especially aristocracy in the deep South, and this story is told from their point of view. Why read classic literature or historic fiction at all, if the past must be sugar-coated for modern sensibilities? There is nothing to be learned from that. OF COURSE some of the attitudes toward ladies seem old-fashioned now. That goes without saying. But that is part of its charm and helps to explain why Scarlett is as conniving as she is. She's no fool! The Old South had its faults and cruelties (namely slavery) but largely as a result of those faults, it also did not survive. GWTW portrays this fall. Thus, there is so much to be learned from the book, historically and morally. Its very brilliance is the way it captures a snapshot of that long-lost culture, from its most beautiful and genteel qualities to its faults that ended up being its downfall, and portrays it changing with the war. The Old South is \"gone with the wind\" but will forever be alive in the pages of this great American novel.Margaret Mitchell depicts the Southerners as what they were: just people, same as the Yankees, trying to defend their own and to sacrifice and to courageously fight for their side as they thought was right, in their stubbornly proud way. And after, when they had been humbled, they were trying to just pick up the pieces and survive, in a cruelly war-ravaged land. The only world they had ever known was ripped out from under them. Gone with the Wind follows Scarlett and our fictional storyline as it parallels every step of the historic timeline, through Reconstruction.In so many ways, Scarlett herself is like the South. In my mind, I feel like she represents the South. As the final page of the book describes, in one of my favorite lines: \"......With the spirit of her people who would not know defeat even when it stared them in the face, she raised her chin. She could get Rhett back.\"",
            "There's probably nothing I can say about Gone With the Wind that hasn't already been said, but I'm going to put in a plug for it anyway, because it's an incredible book and because a large number of people (most probably haven't read it) just don't get it--I'm talking particularly about those who think it's a romance novel.Gone With the Wind is incredible for its value as historical fiction. Written in the early 20th century by an author who grew up hearing stories about the Civil War and Reconstruction, it recreates that era far more successfully than any modern-day writer could. I've lived most of my life within a half-day's drive of Atlanta, but had never heard the South's perspective in the Civil War laid out as it is here. Some have complained that the book is racist, but to me, that's part of the point. This is no whitewashed, modern-day version of what Southerners thought in the 1860s; instead, it's a priceless and sometimes surprising reproduction of what they really thought and how that culture (very different from today's South!) operated.Aside from the beautiful portrayals of the people, places and events of the time period, there's some good action--those turned off by long books will be surprised at how readable this one is. The main characters, like them or hate them, are well-developed. And, yes, they have love lives. But then, we're modern readers, even if Scarlett isn't, so we should be used to that, right?",
            "I read this book as a little girl of nine or ten. Then I reread it and reread it until I practically had it memorized. No other book has affected me like this, and I've read many other books, including many of the great classics of literature. I have yet to find another Gone With the Wind.This book is life changing. To those who dismiss it as sexist racist trash, I would argue this: If describing reality as it is is sexist and racist, perhaps that simply reflects that there is a great deal of sexism and racism in reality. Were the people of the South prior and after the Civil War racist? Yes. Of course. Were these sexist times? Yes. Does it glorify sexism and racism.Perhaps. It is only fair to give this last question some consideration. There are sentiments in this book that are racist. I think of the feelings expressed of longing for the old days, the days of slavery, expressed by the main characters. But these are certainly feelings that were held by the people who clung so steadfastly to that way of life.I do not agree that all of the African Americans were portrayed as stupid. Even Prissy, in her own way, was not stupid. She was a detestable character, black or white, but not necessarily stupid, just daydreamy. But Mammy is anything but stupid. She certainly has a greater understanding of Scarlett than Scarlett's own mother ever did.Sexist?I don't know if this makes me a \"sexist\" but I have never identified with a character as much as I did Scarlett. It was as if I were reading the thoughts in my own head. She is manipulative, headstrong, stubborn, narcissistic, a dreamer, a romantic, and ultimately a realist, who stays in reality, and stays strong by clinging to certain rocks as her world changes around her. Rocks like her farm, Tara. And I love that. I love that when everything else is blown away from her, she clings to the things she learned to value in her childhood. \"Land,\" her father had told her, \"Land is the only thing worth fighting for.\"This book has given me strength throughout my life. I don't cling to the land, because I have none to cling to. But I cling to the things that give me a sense of something permanent and unchanging in my world, and especially when times seem unstable, and change seems to ruthlessly rip out all the familiar structures I have around me.",
            "I absolutely loved this book! I have to admit that when I first started reading the book, I had no idea what it was about. I read the beginning and was apauled to find out that I was reading a book about slave owners (I was a bit close-minded). After many assurances from family members that it was a very good book, I continued reading...and could not put it down.This book opened my mind to alot of possibilities. I really liked seeing the civil war from this perspective. Even though this is a fiction book, it did shed a different light on some of the events that took place in that time period. I enjoyed learning about some of the customs of this period and why they had them.Scarlett's constant battle with who she is and who she wants to be makes for some interesting situations. I found my own ideas of the characters changing with every page as new information was given of each one. Though I didn't like some of Scarlett's choices, I was able to understand why she made each one. You never know when something good or bad is going to happen in this book...it could be the next paragraph.This is a really long book, but it's worth every page. I think Margaret Mitchell did a great job writing it. It will definately be a book that I recommend to everyone I know.",
            "It's hard to believe that I'd never read GWTW. I've seen the film multiple times and I know a bit about the history of the novel. _Gone With the Wind_ sold more than 1,000,000 copies in the six months after it was released in 1936, and a year later Mitchell was awarded the Pulitzer prize for her effort. It's certainly one of the best-loved books of our century, with fans ranging from feminists who are trying to reclaim Scarlett to groups like the United Daughters of the Confederacy.So when I picked up the book, my biggest question was whether or not it was worth so much fuss and adoration. I suppose that my answer has to be 'yes'. Mitchell's writing style is occasionally uneven and it took me 50 pages to get used to her diction, but the story is so sweeping and the characters so well-realized that all concerns about style and tone were lost in the experience of the book.In many ways, I found the book a much stronger story than emerges in the film. Unhampered by censorship, the world that Scarlett moves in in the book is much uglier than the one in the film-- painful miscarriages, brothels, wounds and poverty fill Mitchell's picture of the post-war south and make Scarlett's character much stronger and much less petulant than she emerges in the film.Although daunting in length, I found that the pages literally flew by, and I was sorry in the end when the story closed. Definitely a 'should read'.",
            "Unlike the movie, this book is NOT a \"romance novel\"; it's a hard-hitting account of Southern life during the Civil War, told from a Southern point of view, told as if from the period. The racist attitudes of the time, though naturally, entirely unsavory from today's point of view, existed, and denying it won't erase the facts. Mitchell WASN'T trying to make a statement of ANY kind, pro or con; she merely wrote on how things were, as opposed to how one wished they might be, or wished them to be different. The dichotomies between black and white life are entirely realistic, and to portray them as anything otherwise would be foolhardy. The only way to know how ghastly our history was in terms of its treatment of humanity is to preserve the facts as they were, and this book, without even trying, does exactly that.Too, it would be a serious mistake to paint this book as an idyllic, romantic love story. Mitchell, to her credit, does not fall back on dime-store novel clich&eacute;s, and unfortunately, she is rarely accorded respect for this. Because of the movie, an entirely different, not altogether flattering, slant permeates the whole \"Gone With The Wind\" phenomenon - and which debased Mitchell's intentions in the appalling Alexandra Ripley sequel.If everyone who saw the film had read the book, realization might be more widespread as to how they differ, and how much more complex and sharply drawn are the characters.Scarlett and Rhett are two unapologetic opportunists who are startlingly lacking in typical \"storybook\" appeal. Instead, their \"appeal\" is in how earthy and shrewd they both are, survivors by discarding public approval and approbation. In the end, both are humbled (\"redeemed\" is too strong a word) by life and their chronic misunderstanding of each other - and wind up, naturally, alone. Mitchell, shrewdly enough, in a rare move of unsentimentality, does not go the \"happily ever after\" route - Rhett leaves Scarlett, ruthlessly, abruptly. How could Butler, after being so shabbily treated, retain his self-respect by staying with Scarlett? All the other characters are drawn with wonderful strokes of originality and vividness - human, flawed and far more appealing than the pastel versions portrayed in the film.Mitchell was an incredible vernacular writer, and her skills in doing so emphasized the differences between all the cultures, classes and races. Astonishing is Mitchell's ability to combine history, social commentary and fiction with unbelievable ease; after several hours of reading, the reader may feel as though he had been in a virtual time machine, so indelibly detailed are the locales, weather, sounds and even smells. Even more absorbing are the marvelous dialogues between the characters, especially those of Rhett and Scarlett. Mitchell had a grasp as to how humans interact through words, and unlike, say, Ayn Rand, the conversations sound as if they are spoken by real people.Finally, though, for those who thought that Mitchell was Olde-Tyme in her attitudes and conventions because she was able to depict them so vividly, I suggest the reader pay close attention to the character of Rhett Butler, and his disdain for Old South values. Mitchell pulled a fast one by revealing, through Butler's character, just how modern a thinker she was. Butler repeatedly upbraids Scarlett for her early adherence to an antiquated \"value system\" and mockingly scorns the society around him. He sees what a sham and fakery of all the conventions that exist, and of having to accede to a mass-mentality. Through Rhett Butler, Mitchell slyly tucks in her own incredibly multi-faceted, intellectually-based mindset.Mitchell's book is one of the true greats in American novels.",
            "Roseywater, I don't like this book because it is racist. According to your \"racist\" point of view we all should consider that the Odissey is not a good work because it is also racist, we shouldn't like \"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\" because it is racist, we shouldn't like \"The Great Gatsby\" because it is classist, etc, etc, etc.You should leave out that way of criticism and appreaciate the essence of human relations that surfaces in this wonderful story. The book is not racist, some characters are. But remember this is a book that explores how people were in the 1860s in the Southern US and it would be unrealistic if some characters, or many of them, were not portrayed as racist.",
            "Thirty plus years ago, I lived and breathed \"Gone With the Wind\" in one huge, invigorating, life-changing gulp. I am writing this review because there is a whole new generation out there that should be exposed to this ground-breaking book.Epic in scope at over 1,000 pages, \"Gone With the Wind\" is a story of the Civil War, set in the deep South. The central charater is the infamous Scarlett O'Hara, a tempestuous, beautiful southern belle who secretly loves Ashley Wilkes, a childhood friend who marries his saintly cousin Melanie. At their engagement barbeque, Scarlett meets the dashing, mysterious Rhett Butler, the black sheep of a distinguished Charleston family. This event marks the last day of their antebellum lives, and sets the stage for the ravages of war that follow. Covering a time frame of roughly twelve years, \"GWTW\" is also a story of the new South that rises from the ashes of the old.Scarlett, one of the most indelible characters of modern fiction, is ruthless and selfish, a survivor and a fighter. A feminist long before her time, Scarlett pays dearly for the choices she makes. Rhett is a more complex individual with one weakness. He hides his love for Scarlett, prefering to pop in and out of her life until he \"catches her between husbands\". It is Rhett who is the more sympathetic character, deeply intelligent, self-mocking and sometimes heartbreakingly sad. Rhett, in spite of his worldly ways, is more representative of the old south, while Scarlett depicts the new.\"Gone With the Wind\" is fabulously well-written, plotted and researched. It has been criticized as racist, and it is so. No author today could get away with these portrayals of African Americans. But you have to remember that this book was written in the 1930s. Keep that in mind if you become angry. Personally, I feel that Mammy is one of the strongest, noblest women to appear in a work of fiction.This work is a must read for everyone. Savor it, reread it and be moved as many before you have been.",
            "The book was excellent, however it was missing page 713. It had page 813 in its place. Therefore the book had page 813 displayed twice in the book. I also went to a local bookstore and noticed all 4 books by this publisher had the same problem.",
            "Does anybody not already know the story? Well just in case, be warned there are spoilers ahead.First, let's get this out of the way: Margaret Mitchell's \"Gone With the Wind,\" a story of the Civil War and Reconstruction in Georgia, is racist, and it paints a falsely idyllic portrait of slavery. There's no getting around it. Blacks are depicted as the functional equivalent of small children or draft animals who are best off under the loving care and protection of their white masters. They fulfill a narrative role similar to that of the dog Enzo in \"The Art of Racing In the Rain,\" devoted servants who are sometimes loyal to the point of heroism, and occasionally wise observers of their owners. Slave owners are kindly taskmasters, willing to spend thousands of dollars to buy slaves they don't need from other plantations to keep families together, loath to use harsh words or inflict discipline, and generously concerned with their slaves' physical and spiritual welfare. Slaves laugh in their cozy cabins and have comfortable clothes, plentiful food and attentive medical care. The \"better class\" of slaves recognize how good they have it and stay with their masters after the Emancipation Proclamation. Abolitionists are ignorant outsiders who don't want anything to do with black people and who can't even imagine the family feeling masters share with their slaves. You can make all the excuses you want about where Margaret Mitchell was from, the stories she heard as a child, and prevailing attitudes when this book was published in the 1930s. I know of no other American novel of comparable \"classic\" status that contains such a sustained portrayal of slave owner benevolence and black inferiority.That said, and I don't think these concerns are small matters, \"Gone With the Wind\" works brilliantly as a popular novel. To be sure, it has its flaws. If you like minimalism, you will find much of the prose overripe. There are more characters and scenes than are strictly necessary, even allowing for the vast historic scope of the story. I could do with a bit less wallowing in the red clay soil of north Georgia. The operatically star-crossed romance of Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara does not bear too close inspection.GWTW works so well nonetheless because Margaret Mitchell is touched with genius when it comes to structure, pacing, and characterization. As another reviewer put it, she has incisive insight into the human heart. She also has the good sense to leave her readers guessing all the way to the end. We can each draw our own conclusions as to whether Scarlett will get Rhett back. Aspiring novelists and novelists who want to write better novels would do well to study GWTW regularly.Reading this book again for the first time in decades, after many heart-fluttering trips through as a dreamy, lonely adolescent girl, I was floored by Mitchell's skill at setting scene after scene that grabs the reader's attention, drives the story forward, and tempts you to read \"just one more\" until the clock is ticking into the small hours of the morning and the sky through the crack in the window blind slips from black to gray. Mitchell's prose flows (sorry, cliche ahead) like a clear, swift-moving stream. It's not the highest art, but it's miles above most popular fiction.The characters, archetypes though they may be, are as vividly alive as any I can remember. Even before I re-read GWTW, I could, from memory, have told you all about Scarlett's childish willfulness, shrewd business acumen, lack of insight, fierce love of the land and insane commitment to keeping her word. I'd forgotten her occasionally touching acts of kindness, such as when, after her father dies in a riding accident, she gives his gold watch to his body servant, Pork, with no visible ulterior motive. I could have told you about Melanie's steely gentility, Ashley's dreamy weakness, Mammy's wisdom, Gerald O'Hara's sweet madness, and Ellen O'Hara's suicidal devotion to duty as she saw it. Rhett Butler is a wonderfully complex, infuriating character whose conflicts and sorrows come from his being a gentleman (at least by the standards of his culture) in spite of his own better judgment. The fact that people react so strongly to Scarlett, Rhett and the rest, favorably or not, is testament to Mitchell's having made them so real that we believe in them even when our rational minds suggest we do otherwise.Mitchell does a remarkable job capturing universal human emotions and frailties: the fearful, loving relationship a small child has with his mercurial mother, the wisdom that there can be happiness only when like marries like, the stubborn folly of romantic regret, the pain and blame that come to a couple when a beloved child dies, or the inability to see others as they really are, whether it's the strength of steel under a genteel, innocent exterior or a vulnerable, devoted heart lurking behind a sardonic facade.Every tragedy needs its comic relief. A seldom-noted feature of GWTW is Mitchell's humor. She directs a sharp wit at the hypocrisy of Old Guard Atlanta and affectionate humor at the child characters she, a childless woman herself, handles with such insight and aplomb.Pat Conroy's introduction does a nice job as far as it goes in explaining how GWTW shaped the inner lives of generations of women, especially Southern women and how it will always be popular in countries that lost a war. Beyond that, I think GWTW's popularity endures in spite of its cringe-inducing attitudes for a couple of reasons. First, it's an early story of female self-sufficiency. Driven by fear of poverty, aided by a sharp mind, a solid work ethic and scruples that are none too fine, Scarlett makes her own money. Not for her the ladylike impoverished widow's pursuits of millinery, baking, or boardinghouse operation, or the unladylike pursuit of a brothel. Instead, she goes into the building trades, buying and running lumber mills, competing as sharply as any man in the business. Second, it's a quintessentially American story of, as Mitchell herself put it, \"gumption.\" In the world of GWTW, anyone with enough gumption can triumph over any adversity. GWTW reflects something so deeply ingrained in the American psyche that it will have an audience as long as anybody anywhere believes in the American archetype of the self-made person.In spite of its flaws, GWTW deserves its place in the top rank of popular fiction.",
            "This book was wonderful. I love reading about the south and the Civil War era is a wonderful back drop for the story of the spoiled southern belle Scarlett, and the dashing Rhett. I personally feel that this book is the mother of historical romance and will last the test of time. I read this book the first time when I was 12 or 13 and re-read it again as an adult. My memory of this story was not altered by the length of time between these reads.Better then the movie and wonderfully descriptive with real characters that grow as a result of their experiences you will not be disappointed with this book.",
            "5+ stars! I have read Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind 3 times over my 60 years and it still ranks in my top 2 greatest books ever written. It is an American Masterpiece. A classic of its time. Epic in scope, it is simply a good story that you never want to end. Happy, sad, contrite, vengeful, mean, loving, mysterious, hypocritical; yes, it has all the human emotions and foibles of life and more. To borrow a line from Charles Dickens' Tale of Two Cities: \"It was the best of times, it was the worst of time\", but most of all it was their times.One of the vary best books ever written concerning character development. Ms. Mitchell was superb. Her use of emotion and empathy made the characters come alive and it was as if they were in the room with you.To say more about this wonderful American classic would be redundant and hyperbole.It is an absolute must read. A true American classic masterpiece.*Note: I have seen the movie many times and it too is an American classic. Stunning in character portrayal and scenery. BUT, the book has the broad scope and in-depth character development that the movie could never portray unless it was many hours longer. Simply put, The book Rules!!",
            "Being a guy this is kind of hard for me to admit, but this is the best book that I have ever read to date. I know that this is a \"chick book\" but I found it completely fascinating. I learned much more about the civil war from this book than I ever did from a history book or a classroom. I also learned about the origination of the KKK, all about slavery and all about real southern hospitality. There is so much more to this book than just a great story. You actually get to feel what it would have been like to grow up and live on a plantation before, during and after the civil war. I believe that this book should be read by everyone because of its historical value even though the story itself is fiction. I have read very few books where you really know and feel for the characters like you do in GONE WITH THE WIND.",
            "A fourteen year old who loves to read almost anything under the sun:I loved this book. When I was in seventh grade I checked it out of our little school library because it had a lot of points--we'd read books, take a test, and receive a certain number of points for that book. If we got everything correct, we got full points, and we needed many points to pass English every trimester.I didn't realize I was going to fall in love with the characters. Each person is beautifully made, intricate, and unique. You grow to know everyone in the story. Margaret Mitchell doesn't let any detail slide. She describes Scarlett beautifully.Scarlett is perhaps the most interesting character I've ever read. I hate her completely, and yet love her just the same. She was the most spoiled brat, and yet I felt like I was part of her, or she was part of me.Also, Margaret Mitchell does a good job of justifying the Confederate's reasons for breaking off from the United States. Although I don't agree with slavery at all, I could see where the southerners came off, believing as they did, and even felt a little angry at the northerners for being so hotheaded themselves.For those of you who have seen the movie and liked it, buy this book, its ten times better. And for those of you who disliked the movie, still get the book. It is very much different from the movie, you get in the whole world, and they left out so much in the movie. For instance, Scarlett ... well, just read it, it's good.",
            "I was reluctant to read Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind because I thought it was basically a romance novel. It is not. It includes some very appealing characters and lots of action.The focus of the novel is on Scarlett O'Hara. She is a magnificent creature, beautiful and strong, but she is completely defined by her selfishness. When she is a fresh young woman, her selfishness is actually appealing - at least to Rhett Butler, a rogue who appreciates anyone who flaunts conventional morality. As time passes, though, Rhett matures and Scarlett does not, and her selfishness has more serious consequences.The plot moves quickly through a series of exciting episodes: battles are won or lost, men and women fall in love, babies are born and soldiers die. The author maintains suspense as we await the defeat of the Confederacy but of course the result is never in doubt. At the end of the war, genteel Southern society collapses and is replaced by coarse commercialism and opportunism. The aristocracy is ruined and its members are forced into trades. Against this backdrop, we watch the romance between Scarlett and Rhett Butler develop and then wane.Mitchell depicts the antebellum South as a happy society with a place for everyone, from the planter aristocracy down to the slaves who thrive under their paternalistic care. This depiction is affecting but obviously idealized. Many subsequent passages of the book, dealing with racial relations during the reconstruction, are even more offensive to African-Americans. Mitchell wrote Gone with the Wind 70 years ago and her views on race are not modern ones. Still, there is no denying her ability as a writer, and there is no denying that Gone with the Wind is a great novel.",
            "\"Gone with the Wind\" by Margaret Mitchell is one of my favorite books of all time. Scarlet O'Hara, the foolish southern belle is in love with Ashley Wilkes, a scholar who won't have anything to do with her. To rebel, she marries his fianc&eacute;e' s brother and when the war breaks out, it turns ugly. She is then forced to move to Atlanta to her husband's house. In Atlanta, Georgia during the Civil War things aren't easy. It is hot and sandy. The sticky humidity is horrible to live in yet the feeling of \"home\" is evident everywhere. There are always barbecues and lazy afternoons up till the war. The south is mostly cotton fields, with little factories while the north is full of manufacturing. Things don't look too good for the south when the war breaks out and to make everything worse, the ports are soon closed off. All too soon Scarlet feels the bitterness of war as her childhood friends die for a losing cause. When she finds Atlanta being attacked by General Sherman she must flee for safety and there is nowhere to go.This story is about a girl who has been spoiled her entire life and then must learn to do things on her own. She faces the fact that she can't have everything and that she has to make sacrifices. Her whole life she has been the brat that depends on everyone else so she can't do anything on her own. She is blinded by her own insolence to the truth that nothing is fair. Sweet Melanie, her sister in law is kind to her and is too sweet hearted to see the wrong in anyone; she doesn't see how corrupt Scarlet' s mind is. She is always on Scarlet' s side despite the horrible things that she does. Scandalous Rhett Butler loves Scarlet for her foul heart and chases her throughout the whole book. Rhett has a history for doing unthinkable things to girls. (Unthinkable at the time; refusing to marry a girl he courted, publicly kissing, etc.) Everyone despises him for making a profit off of the war. All proper people support the failing cause and Rhett makes fun of them. He is a businessman, so nothing is personal till he meets Scarlet. As time progresses, Scarlet comes to realize the damage that she has done with her being wicked to everyone. She literally is and was a spoiled brat. Her suffering teaches her a lesson that we all should learn.If you love historical fiction with a little romance, this book is perfect for you. Scarlet is the perfect Southern belle who is incredible to read about. How she attracts men with her charm and little helpless acts is unbelievable. She is used to having slaves serve her and she treats them with little or no respect until she needs them. You cannot stop thinking about how much you would hate Scarlet if she was real, but you can't stop feeling sorry for her and you want to help her to realize how stupid she is.In this book you have a look at how the south was before and after the Civil War. They were still people with feelings, not horrible people who were wicked. You fall in love with the chivalry and way of life. You also realize how wrong slavery was. Even they knew it was wrong, they just couldn't imagine life without the slave labor. I think that the book is written well, you see why people did things and the reasoning behind their actions. I didn't always agree with what Scarlet did, but I knew why she did things. The book is very interesting and I couldn't put it down at all. I certainly would recommend it to just about anyone. I certainly understand the era better now. The book got me interested in other books about the war and now I can see why people felt the way they did. I can see the good and bad in slavery. I feel that lack of education on the issue is what caused such disastrous effects.",
            "Introduction: This classic novel is full of famous statements like `Tomorrow is an other day.' It is also made into a film, which had won 9 Oscar Academy Awards based on this story.Summary: This story is set in the American Civil War. Scarlet O'Hara is a pretty but proud young lady. She is living in the south of America. Gentlemen love her. But the prince in Scarlet heart is Ashley. Ashley is a bookworm. Although Scarlet loves him, he has chosen his cousin to be his wife. Scarlet is so angry and marry a man she doesn't love. But then the war breaks out. Scarlet's husband dies. The land south of America is losing from land north of America. She then finally finds her true love. Rhett Buttler, Scarlet's third husband has a wonderful time with her until Rhett finds a great secret about Scarlet...Opinion: I think that this story is absolutely wonderful. When you are reading the book, the character's personality will attract you. But I don't really like Scarlet. Although she is beautiful, she is vain and mean. It has a very good storyline. It makes you continue reading page after page. This book teaches us a lot of lessons. And it also tells us how bad, cruel war is. I think this is the greatest love story ever.Audience: This book is good for age 13 or above. It is good for everyone. But I'm afraid that the complicated story will confuse younger readers. J",
            "I read this when I was in 5th grade, and I fell in love with it! Scarlett is one of the most interesting, fun-to-read-about characters ever, and you're pretty much transported to the world of the antebellum American South.There's a reason this book has such enduring popularity!",
            "Gone With the Wind is an amazing book that leaves you a changed person.Treasure, treasure, treasure your first time read because the impact of this book is so deep you'll be left in a trance for days. Whilst reading this novel you will eat, sleep, breathe Gone With the Wind - so place any important activities on hold and don't read if there is any exams ahead!The first time you read it is a feeling that will be in your heart forever!!! A magical journey that grips your senses and rips at your heart, but devestatingly,can only be travelled once. But don't worry, although you can never really grasp those same feeling ever again, the book will still have you hooked everytime you read it. You will still hope and wish that Scarlett will find true happiness, even if such dreams are futile. I've read it on average once a year since that first awesome time and it neevr ceases to hook me in.The characters are all well-developed, particularly Scarlett (the main character). The reader is given a great insight and undestanding of Scarlett which is why she rightfully claims her spot in history. She is quite simply unforgettable. An amazing character who stands the test of time and, in my mind, has become a memory of a real person.Reader's should not look to this book for the rights and wrongs of slavery or deep insights of the civil war. This is a romance novel that Mitchell has intwined beautifully with minor war details and a subtle look into the pre-war South.There is a reason why this is one of the most well-known and purchased book of all time. Read it and you will find out. But be warned, the ending will break your heart and it will be as painful as any real-life romance. Hard to believe I know, but the characters so amazing that they stay with you 24 hours a day whislt reading and you feel their emotions like you are them. Margaret Mitchell was a very talented lady.",
            "The last book that I finished was Gone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell. It is set during the Civil War in the South, specifically in Atlanta. It is the story of Scarlett O'Hara and how her life changes during the Civil War and early Reconstruction. She is selfish and vain and will do about anything to rebuild her life after the North wins the war. She is left very poor and has to provide for the survivors of her family. She will do anything to make some money, even marry several times to people that she doesn't care for while the real \"love\" of her life is married to her sister-in-law. Scarlett just wants to have enough money to once again become the belle of the county.One character that she meets on this journey that I particularly enjoyed was Rhett Butler. Rhett is a charming, opinionated man with money that sees Scarlett how she really is and tells people the truth, however harsh that it is.I liked this book because it is about the Civil War, but through the eyes of a vain young woman whose life drastically changes. If you like historical fiction with a romantic twist, you will probably enjoy this classic tale of love between two interesting personalities.",
            "Hey, 'Reader from Santa Fe'. Yes there are passages which are cringeworthy. And do you know what? Thank God it's never been banned! For MM to have written it any other way would be a fib. No, I'm not talking about the glorification of slavery and their 'barracks.' I am with you and Toni Morrison 100% on the reality of this outrageous part of history. But for MM to have written it any other way would hardly ring true. Anyone who knows about her life knows that she was writing from the perspective that she did because that was her experience. She lived in a world of white supremacy and segregation, and do you know what? I read this and think thank goodness we don't now! Thak goodness I can have the friends that I want to and date the guys I want to, regardless of their background. GWTW is as much a historical document, albeit laced with southern pride, inasmuch as it shows what past attitudes were. I see GWTW as a great story nonetheless, with strong characters clashing with each other and riding roughshod over others in the name of self-survival. Not always attractive qualities, but qualities that have themselves survived. May I recommend The Wind Done Gone by Alice Randall? She writes that MM and GWTW inspired her to think. They inspired me too.",
            "After I read the Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood (by Rebecca Wells), I really wanted to read Gone with the Wind. In Sisterhood, Wells characters actually attend the premier of the movie. I have seen the movie, Gone with the Wind, several times, but, as usual, the book is much better. I really enjoyed the &quot;love story&quot; about Scarlett and Rhett. I wish Mitchell had written the sequel, which I have not read. She did an excellent job with the characters and I amnot sure if anyone could do it better. The story is true to life. Scarlett seemed to think the grass was greener on the otherside and that money/material things is the answer to everything. Not always true. Scarlett failed to see what she had in Rhett, until she lost him. Something to think about. I really hated to see this book end.",
            "The book &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; by Margaret Mitchell is my favorite book ever. Since I was only in sixth grade when I read it, even I found it a great book. Both the movie and the book have been American standards for literature. There are dozens of memorable characters, with plenty of juicy parts to hold it together. Even though it is 1,024 pages, it is very hard to put down. I read it over three months, about 20 pages a day, and I had to limit myself! This is surely the greatest book ever written. However, if you are the movie type, do not let me limit you. See the Academy Award winning move &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; with Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable give thier performance of thier career! Filled with lots of exciting characters, events, scenery, and detail; all of this is needed to create the best piece of American Literature, and &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; by Margaret Mitchell has it all.",
            "Ever since reading Gone with the wind in sixth grade, it has been my favorite book! It is fun and easy to read. Margret Michell knew how to perfectly balance a story with seriousness and pure comic relief. The story takes place during a rough time in the South, The American Civil War. Scarlet is devoted to the Cofederate cause, or at least at sometimes she seems to be. At other times she appears to be more devoted to herself. Rhett Butler, the other main character could care less about the outcome of the war, as long as he is benefiting from the finanical booms it results in. Both the characters are so equally stubborn making them perfect for eachother, but neither of them can see this until it may be too late.",
            "I've been thinking for a long time that I should read this book--and I'm probably not alone. It's not like I don't know the plot, but still, I've always imagined that it's a classic piece of American storytelling. Let's just say that the writing can be hackneyed, and at times cringe-worthy. But what will make this book last is Mitchell's ability to tell a story, to make people want to turn the page, and experience what happens next. This skill is often undervalued and overlooked, but makes her talent stand above the abilities of others who can write a better sentence. I would recommend this book, not as a timeless piece of literature, but of storytelling.",

I didn't know anything about it but now I am full up to the top! I have not read anything quite like this novel which took me weeks to read, and I thank my lucky stars I am me, living in a tiny country where people don't go mad. The sheer volume of words describing conflict, emotions, deprivation and loss was unbelievable. If you want to tuck up on a rainy day (or days) and learn what it was like to live in that century then this is the book for you. Scarlett needed a good smack, Rhett needed a good hug, Pittypat needed a box of tissues, Ashley needed a ramrod for his spine and Melly needed a sainthood. Yes, I understood what was written about the war, and loathed it, but isn't that what a story is supposed to do? Wring out your feelings? And I certainly am wrung out. This book gives you more buck for your dollar than many I have read, so go on - put your feet up and get stuck in to Gone with the Wind. Makes you feel grateful for what you have.",

            "\"Gone With the Wind\", taken as pure fiction, stands as an interesting and well-written tale of life in the Old South. Characters are well developed and constant in their portrayal of the complexities of love and life under the strain of a collapsing civilization. Survival amidst tremendous hardships and the source of strength in the human soul are topics that the novel/movie address nicely. However, taken in a context of reality, \"Gone With the Wind\" is insulting to the reader's/viewer's intelligence and to the ancestors of Southerners, both black and white, free and slave, through its completely one-sided depiction of life in the plantation south. Many other reviewers on this site have commented that \"Gone With the Wind\" is a nice change from other books and movies in that it portrays the master/slave relationship as being affable. The truth, however, is not so pleasant. It is evident from the reading of historical documents that even the kindest of slaveholders did not keep their slaves as well-clothed, well-fed, and lightly worked as the O'Haras kept theirs. Only once did the movie portray slaves doing field labor. It never showed the slaves' living quarters, which were often less than comfortable. The only brutality and punishment it showed was when Scarlet hit Prissy for not moving fast enough when Melanie was giving birth. The representation of Mammy is partly accurate in that she was a jack-of-all-trades woman who cared especially for the master's children. The other side of the \"Mammy\" role however, was that on most plantations, the mammy was overworked, on-call 24 hours a day, and abused sexually and physically by the master. Also, a mammy would have never had the authority to boss around a master's daughter like Mammy bossed around Scarlet. For those who desire a well-written piece of fiction that takes place in a beautiful and gentile fantasy world called the Old South, I would surely recommend \"Gone With the Wind\". For those who know better than to believe in illusions of peace and warmth in the plantation south and who enjoy books that have at least one foot in the doorway of reality, \"Gone With the Wind\" will not be on your list of favorites.",
            "Nice story, feels a little like a soap opera at times, but the civil war part of the story is excellent. Could have and should have been shorter...lots of filler.Overall it is pretty good read.",
            "This is one of those books where you find a little bit of yourself in each character, rather than finding one you can entirely associate with. It's imposible to completely like or completely hate any of the characters.There are many reasons I can't bring myself to read any of the liscenced or unofficial sequels to this book:1)This book was written about 73 years after the time setting of the book itself, & when the author was born in 1700, Having read books from that time, like Baum's Oz series, culture of the late 19tch century & early 20th century were more similar than the 1900s are from now, so she wouldn't have had to do nearly as much research on life in the Confederate South as a sequel writer would, & a sequal writer younger than herself would have their cultural views skewed by the changes of modern times.2)It doesn't really need a sequel. If you think about what direction the story might have gone in if Rhett didn't leave Scarlet; They were incapable of being happy together it might have had the same kind of tragic ending as Warren Adler's \"War of the Roses.\" Or since Scarlet is such a proud woman who has been married to many men she didn't love, she might return from Tara & decide to divorce Rhett upon his promised occasional returns & marry the childish Ashley just to kick Rhett in the side for abandoning her. Or she could have gone another 5 or 10 years persuing Rhett only to loose interest in him when she finally won him back; like she looses interest in anything else when the hunt is over.I recommend \"War of the Roses,\" as well as Jane Austin's \"Pride & Prejudice,\" as I find similarity in their rough relationship as well.",
            "I think that Gone with the wind is the best book ever written the movie is a winner to . I love how it informs you of everything that is going on. You go through the whole book like will Scarlett and Redett get together or will they stay together will Scarlett finally get Ashely. Will they survive the war. Who will live and who will die. You read through the tragides and the good times . I give Gone with the Wind and will argue with anyone who differs.",
            "Thinking of this book, it's hard to avoid a real feeling of sadness. Unfortunately, many people know NOTHING about post- Civil War Reconstruction besides what they read in GWTW and saw in the 1939 movie. Everything from both sources that relates to the Reconstruction era is wrong-- and yes, I do mean EVERYTHING. America reached a peak of racial harmony in those years that in many ways it has yet to reattain. It was an era of honest, integrated government, integrated education, integrated workplaces, and so much more. Many, many white people, including Southerners and former Confederates, were able to lay their racism aside to an astonishing degree and attempt to rebuild a new South. It was a shining, extraordinary period of our nation's history. Too bad few people know anything accurate about it, and instead get totally incorrect information from sources like GWTW!",
            "The cover of this book appealed to me more than the classic, hardback and so I purchased it instead just a few weeks ago. The book arrived on time and everything appeared to be in perfect condition. However, the old adage, \"You can't judge a book by it's cover\" must be very true, indeed, considering that at least two pages are missing and that one is replaced with a later page.With that aside, being that I am an avid reader, I'm almost ashamed to admit that I have not read this book until recently and fortunately, I wasn't succumbed to it despite all of the cult-like adoration it receives. Besides Margret Mitchell's writing being possibly the best I think I've ever come across; passionate descriptions, believable characters and dialogue, etc.,GWTW is filled with anti-equality, anti-Republican, hate speech that is impossible to ignore, and the book could have easily been shortened by at least 300 pages. Though Mitchell's writing style was obviously brilliant, she tended to delve too far into trivial details concerning things that were utterly pointless in my opinion.I agree wholeheartedly with another reviewer that Ms. Mitchell would possibly have an extremely difficult time getting her book published today.",

I came to the conclusion that I should spend my time reading books I find entertaining. I don't see how anyone could possibly find this book entertaining. The three stars I gave it are because it is a well written book, and I figure, hey any book with this kind of a reputation deserves something. One note, what about this son of Rhett's? Did Margaret Mitchell just forget to tell us the background on him? Obviously there is a big story behind that...all I can figure is that he is the child of Belle Watling, as the book never really did say why he got involved with her in the first place. I dont feel like reading a sequel that wasnt even written by Margaret Mitchell to find out what happens... Anyway, a well written book and I accomplished my purpose...to be able to say that I have read Gone With the Wind. Other than that I didn't get a whole heck of a lot out of it.",

            "As others have said in their reviews, GWTW is a great book. To repeat all the reasons why would be quite redundant of me. Simply, I recommend GWTW if one wants to discover the white southern female point of view concerning the Civil War era American south. I also recommend Harriet Jacobs' &quot;Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl&quot; to anyone BRAVE enough to discover the black southern female slave point of view concerning the Civil War era American south. Seeing as GWTW is very long, and Ms. Jacobs' work is around 200 pages, I'd read &quot;Incidents&quot; first. It's another truly amazing literary work...an account of southern slavery from the pen of a former slave herself! There is much much interesting information concerning the relationship between mistress and female slave/house attendant that will provoke thought as one reads GWTW afterwards.",

            "... Millions of people not only remember Gone with the Wind, but re-read it faithfully. Literary critics and scholars don't like this book and wish it would go away. The reason? They can't quite account for its enduring popularity. It's sentimental. It doesn't break new literary ground. It's racist. Blah, blah, blah. And yet. How many other works of so-called \"popular fiction\" from the '30s and '40s are remembered, let alone read, today? None. How many are even in print? None. The hub-bub surrounding Alice Randall's satirical follow-up last year had less to do with that novel's merits than the near mythical status Gone with the Wind has achieved in American culture. Why? Because Mitchell tells a helluva story. Unforgettable and complex characters, an involving plot and a timeless theme: survival. The pacing, structure and language run circles around most books published today, yes, even those with literary aspirations. All this and heroine who dares not to be liked. Come to think of it, maybe Mitchell did break new ground. Pick it up. You won't be able to put it down.",
            "I expected this book to be just a dramatic love story but it is so much more than that.I fell in love with Rhett, expierianced all the pain scarlett went through,cried when Melly died and laughed over and over again at Rhett and scarlett's witty repartee.To me this means this is a great book and to anybody that will listen I would tell you that, to not read it would mean that you are really missing out on a wonderful expierience.",
            "This is a great book, I borrowed it from the library twice and then decided to just go ahead and buy it. I bought the paperback version, which is great to read, but my only problem was it falls apart. After reading through about 2 chapters, and only one week of owning the book, the paper had separated from the back. I definitely would recommend the book, only get the hardback one.",
            "It isn't all about the romance. Let me just blurt this out: Rhett is the HOTTEST MAN and after reading this you will be disappointed in every man you meet! He makes my blood boil like mad! He drives me mad! God, he's so damn sexy. He truly knows a woman and what she wants, and definitely what I want. I suggest that every man read in detail of Rhett's kissing technique because we need more men with skills like those. But enough of my gushing. Gosh, I wish I could have met this gifted writer who has combined multiple themes, tones, characters, and ideas and weaved it into this novel. I am not kidding nor exaggerating when I say this is the best novel, was always the best novel, and will always be the best novel. I've never laughed so hard or sobbed so much for a book. Everything fits right into place. THis is a perfect symphony on which the description of setting flow so well into the characters. I love the clever remarks of Rhett. Yes, he's VERY clever, as well as sexy. However, this is NOT a trashy romance novel. Margaret Mitchell does not give the usual and cliched damsel in distress heroine. Many intelligent and not-so-intelligent people have complained that of supposed rape, the inaccuracy of slaves were actually treated by their owners, and other indecencies. The one about rape is a flimsy complaint that can be easily refuted because it wasn't and the description of the scene fully suggests otherwise. However, the latter complaint has more value. However, if you really want to see the truth of the treatment of black slaves, just pick up Howard Zinn's A People's History of the United States for such purposes. I am glad that the heroine was an imperfect hero. She was as real as any human. Scarlett is the person name for her because it certainly reflects her red-hot devotion to her beloved home Tara and her parents. Other characters such as Melanie and Ashley were so excellently developed. The characters can't get any closer to reality. However, I have lost many nights of sleep for reading this. This is so addictive that I could give up sleep for days in a row.",
            "Margaret Mitchell's \"Gone with the Wind\" is a mesmerizing novel. I saw the movie when I was young and disliked it immensely. Therefore, I never read the book until it was selected for a book club. With some trepidation, I began reading and was immediately plunged into a riveting tale.This epic concerns the headstrong Scarlett O'Hara, a southern belle who becomes embroiled in the Civil War and Reconstruction Era. It is a story of Scarlett's selfishness and also her courage. The story revolves around the tumultuous relationship that develops between Scarlett and Rhett Butler, an enigmatic, harsh, and pitiable man who recognizes within Scarlett a likeness to himself. However, Scarlett's unrequited love for a gentler man, Ashly Wilkes, proves to be astumbling block to her happiness. Her unrelenting quest to obtain money also causes her to make many enemies. Scarlett symbolizes the changing times, and she and Rhett are a perfect match. Ashley represents the \"old ways,\" and thus this story can be seen as a symbolic journey. Times change, and people must adapt in order to survive. Although I do not necessarily agree with \"survival of the fittest\" mentality, the theme is addressed very poignantly in this story. I was repulsed by Scarletts ruthlessness, yet I also admired her courage and strength. Rhett was heartbreaking as he seemed to be ravaged by his own anger. He was a man who was desperate for love as are we all. Rhett seems to symbolize our own hungry souls. He is strong in some ways yet startlingly weak in others. He reminded me a little of the character Heathcliff in Emily Bronte's \"Wuthering Heights\".My only complaint of the book is the treatment of black individuals. Many people have written on this subject, so I will not do so here. I did like Mammy's character even though she was stereotypical.Mitchell's characterization is superb. My favorite character is Melanie Wilkes. She is portrayed as a gentle yet strong woman. Melanie is courageous in her own way, and I loved her bravery in standing up against others who criticized those she loved. I also felt empathy as well as repugnance for both Scarlett and Rhett. All the characters are memorable, and Mitchell paints a vivid picture of struggle, disstruction, and triumph as the people within the story fight against the ravages of war.This book will stay with you long after you read it. Please give this wonderful story a chance. I'll definitely watch the movie again. I think I'll have a better appreciation for the film. God bless you all.",
            "I've been a fan of the story since I first saw Gone with the Wind when I was a little girl. I didn't even know it was based on a book until all the media attention that the sequel Scarlett got when I was in junior high. I immediately went to the library and checked out Gone with the Wind. Even though I loved the movie I loved the book so much more. There are so many details that have been left out. Since then I've read a lot of other historical fiction but this one is still my favorite. There's a good reason why this is such a popular classic novel.",
            "After seeing the movie many, many, MANY timea, I finally decided I MUST read this book. This is my selection for our book club. I could hardly put the book down. The movie was wonderful, but the book is FANTASTIC! Love it, love it, love it. We will be discussing this selection in our book club in early February and I know each of our members are thoroughly enjoying this read!",
            "This was my third time reading this book, each time in a different age period and each time with different experience and reflection on the story and characters of this wonderfully lavish and complex drama. yes I agree that the story is biased and somewhat racist. However, it reflects the attitudes of the general culture and way of life that existed back then in 1800s during and post Civil War. Put that aside (or rather become familiar with that specific culture), the story is heartbreaking, informative, and really addictive. I mean I would definitely recommend that before starting this book, clear your schedule for a week or two because once you start it is hard to put it down until you have reached the last page! You just get drawn into the this very well written story and you fall in love with all characters that are portraited with all of their complexities, strenghts, weaknesses, and yes lots and lots of mistakes and misunderstandings! So much that it breaks your heart over and over again and you can't help but to shake you head or even swear at them!",

I was in the hospital for a while last year and knew that I would have a lengthy recovery after I got home, so I bought this edition for my Kindle and read a chapter or two every night and it really helped to know it was there at the end of my day. I read it leisurely and loved it once again.I know there are several versions, or editions, for the Kindle, and I don't know about the others, but this one was recommended and it was perfect.",
            "GWTW is one of the best books ever written. Mrs. Mitchell really captured the whole Cival War theme and added a ruthless heroine to the amazing plot to make it even MORE addictive. It tells the story of a woman with gumption, as she called it, spirit, pride, and an everlonging love for Ashley Wilkes. People say it is a racist and sexist book but, in truth, the opinions and views of the characters were how the Southerners thought in the Old South. She wrote about a dream and a mystery that did not survive but was the setting of a love so passionate and endearing that it cannot be described. It told the tale of Knights and their Ladies Fair, of master and of slave. I, personally, thought that the sequel was just as good but it did not give Scarlett the same ruthless qualities. But we must cut Mrs. Ripley some slack, it would be nearly impossible to equal a book as great as GWTW. The plot and characters were simply amazing. Scarlett, the conniving and strong woman that the book focuses on. Rhett, the lover and third husband to Mrs. O'Hara who loved Scarlett so much that it was almost unreal. Melanie Wilkes, the only true friend to Scarlett who was a true gentlewoman with a sense of polite gumption. And then there was Ashley Wilkes, the poor soul that was crushed when the war ended and a person who loved Scarlett dearly but could not and would not abandon his wife and child for society honor. These were the characters that sculpted the greatest love story ever told. It was a Civilization GONE WITH THE WIND.",

            "There is so much lip service paid to how good this book is, and how everyone should read it, and yadda yadda yadda.The prose is boring, way too purple and prosaic. It makes Soap Operas look realistic.None of this speaks to the fact that the whole book is RASCIST. The south was built on the backs of African-Americans, and they died to build the South up. They are still fighting for equality, and now we have some romantic idealization of the South, and Margaret Mitchell makes the Klan look like some good group of good ol' boys.I am disgusted that a book this blatently racist and snotty is still held up as a classic.",

Scarlet is such a spoilt snit that I couldn't care what happened to her. I guess this is one book you either love or hate, so I recommend that you check a volume out of the library and read a chapter or two. If you hate it, you've lost nothing but a little of your time. If you love it, well, there's no accounting for taste.",

            "I have just re-read GWTW for the fourth time and each timeI do I start out thinking it a magnificently written and researched book, with a glorious story - and the patronizing racist attitude of the author - yes, the author herself - makes me sick to my stomach.I devoured this novel when I was thirteen, again in my twenties, then my thirties, and here I am again, keen to know what will happen next to that sociopath Scarlett O'Hara the ultimate sexy, manly man, Rhett Butler and the dreamy dreamer and weakling, Ashley Wilkes.And yet - I believe this book should be banned. There are almost no books I feel that way about. I'm a writer and I abhor censorship. But this book is so outright racist it gags.Why should such stereotypes be allowed to continue for generation after generation to absorb?What would the world think of a romantic novel about dashing German SS officers and a beautiful blonde \"maidchen\" cavorting charmingly before concentration camp slaves? All the while talking about those slaves as if they were simply \"children\" who didn't know any better than to be wearing striped pajamas, carrying out humiliating tasks for their \"masters\" and existing pleasantly and contentedly in their cute little \"barracks\"? Critics would be up in arms. Such a novel would fall into disrepute and no one would claim it to be a great work of literature, even if it was well-written. So why do we stand for GWTW - this travesty of lies, lies, lies?I notice that one of the reviewers below mentioned that slaves weren't, in fact, badly treated. Hello! To begin with, slavery is slavery: an abomination upon the Earth. Any person who is enslaved is being treated badly. Period. Second, that reviewer should read Toni Morrison's \"Beloved\"to find out what it was REALLY like to live as a slave on a southern plantation. That depiction rings true. GWTW, on the subject of slavery, is complete clap-trap.Over and over again, it is mentioned that Scarlett's mother, \"Miss Ellen,\" would be \"turning over in her grave\" to see howScarlett betrayed her southern belle roots. Well, I contend that Margaret Mitchell is turning over in her grave because she knows what a monstrous mistake she made with GWTW. Hopefully, she's evolved, and, knowing her feminist views and her basic fairness as a person, I think she would agree with me - BAN THIS BOOK!",

REALLY, IF RHETT LOVED HER &quot;SO&quot; MUCH, HOW COULD HE JUST LEAVE HER LIKE THAT! THIS BOOK COULD HAVE ABOUT 200 PAGES AND STILL BE TOO LONG! TALK ABOUT TRIVIAL DETAIL! (The hat was emerald green, with a large bouncy ostrich plume, and wide emerald ribbons as big as Scarlett's hands. The dress was 12 yards of green sprigged muslin with only tiny puffed sleeves, it was low enough to be a dancing dress, and certainly not suitable for a morning barbecue. The dress was a green plaid tarlatan, so wide it reduced her wasit to nothingless. Oh, she'd lead that waltz with an apple-green watered-silk dress, and dark green ribbons on her bosom and white tuberroses in her hair.) REALLY, WHO GIVES A DAMN!",
            "this book is so scary! i hated it! the man and the women kissed and it made me feel scared even though i am a big boy im 12 years old already and this stupid book scared me! if you dont want to end up pissing in your pants like me.. then dont read this book... e-mail me with your opinions. but beware this book is some pretty serious stuff",
            "THIS IS THE WORST BOOK EVER WRITTEN! IT WAS PAINFUL FOR ME TO READ THIS GARBAGE! MARGARET MITCHELL WAS OBVIOUSLY RACIST! C'MON, JUST READ THE PART ABOUT RECONSTRUCTION! AND HOW SCARLETT CAN TREAT THE SLAVES LIKE DIRT AFTER THEY HAD MADE TARA A PLANTATION, AND KEPT FOOD ON THE TABLE! REALLY, IF RHETT LOVED HER &quot;SO&quot; MUCH, HOW COULD HE JUST LEAVE HER LIKE THAT! THIS BOOK COULD HAVE ABOUT 200 PAGES AND STILL BE TOO LONG! TALK ABOUT TRIVIAL DETAIL! (The hat was emerald green, with a large bouncy ostrich plume, and wide emerald ribbons as big as Scarlett's hands. The dress was 12 yards of green sprigged muslin with only tiny puffed sleeves, it was low enough to be a dancing dress, and certainly not suitable for a morning barbecue. The dress was a green plaid tarlatan, so wide it reduced her wasit to nothingless. Oh, she'd lead that waltz with an apple-green watered-silk dress, and dark green ribbons on her bosom and white tuberroses in her hair.) REALLY, WHO GIVES A DAMN!",
            "When I saw this ~1000 page book, I got shocked. Actually my mother recommended me it. I really enjoyed every page. It is not the same as learning about U.S. Civil War in history. Everything was written so perfect that it was extremely hard to put the book down when the work awaited. I have never seen so strong characters as Scarlett and Rett had. I was so sad when the book was over, wanted it to last forever. I really love thick books if they are so great that this one. READ IT !!!",
            "I read &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; at the age of 12, and, even though it took me a long time to read, it is the best book I have ever read. Even now, two years later, I use examples and quotes form the book to use in everyday life. This book has something for everyone, romance, action, drama and comedy. Margaret Mitchell is brilliant in the way that she makes you sympathasize with the enemy. You never know what will happen next and it is impossible to put down!",
            "It never got boring. Every page was exciting. The character of Scarlet O'Hara is one that will be your favorite forever. All of her imperfections just make you love her more. It was one of those books that you wish wouldn't have ended, even though it is well over one thousand pages long. It is almost sad to think that no other book, in my mind, will ever live up to Gone With the Wind.",
            "No words can express the feelings this novel has evoked in millions of readers across the globe, and in myself, as well. It sings a song of such captivating music that it tears itself into the very epitome of one's soul; Gone with the Wind has moved me, touched me, held me. It sheds light on lessons more precious than gold or silver, more valuable than platinum. I could go on and on...but I'm sure you get my drift. Cry, weep, laugh, smile...whatever you do, don't be a fool...don't miss out on this one.",
            "I loved the book and I am currently reading 'Scarlett' to see if Scarlett does indeed get her man... I enjoyed reading all about the Civil War and the terrible effects it had on the Southern people. I thought Scarlett, Rhett and Mammy were fantastic characters - although I must admit I did, occassionally, feel like banging Scarlett and Rhett's heads together!! I couldn't stand Ashley - what a wuss!! I particularly liked Melanie, she seems like such a weak little goodie good two shoes but, in fact, she is actually a very strong, courageous woman and the truest friend you could ever have. A wonderful novel - I can see why it is a classic!!",
            "I first saw the movie, and I loved it, so I decided to read the book. I found that the book had so much more depth than the movie which I had already thought breath-taking. Scarlett is someone we can all relate to, yet hopefully not too closely. It is always difficult to stick with a book that is sooo long, but Gone with the Wind was one that wasn't a problem. I loved how Scarlett realized that she loved Rhett because I think that many people overlook their true loves for a lust object that would never make them happy. The book was amazing because it was so beautifully polished and taught many valuable life lessons. I would recommend it to anyone!",
            "Gone With the Wind is one of the best books ever written! It teaches a wonderful lesson. No matter what happens, there is going to be a tomarrow, and you shouldn't give up hope! Scarlett lost everything, but she was still strong and she still had hope. Margaret Mitchell is a wonderful writer. Scarlett and Rhett and her other timeless charactors are so real to me and to millions of people. Only a great book could have such an impact on America and the world that GWTW has!",
            "This is one of the best books I have ever read. If you don't enjoy it, there is something mentally wrong with you! (Just kidding-sort of) I can understand how it could be a challenging book, it IS over 1,000 pages long, however it's worth it. I knew a girl with a learning disability that caused her to read at a very slow rate, therefore giving her a genuine hatred of books. Someone gave her a copy of Gone with the Wind, and though she started it grudgingly, she couldn't put it down, and believe me, she read through that book faster then..well, (stick analogy here) it's a wonderful book! It gives you a true understanding of the south. That's the way it really was. Tara forever.",
            "This probabaly has to be the best book ever written. Mitchell did a great job on the plot, characters, everything! What she did the best on was the characters. Those were definetly three dimentional characters. When you are done you think that there is no way that this is fiction because Scarlett, Rhett, and everybody seem so real. You also come to like Scarlett because with all her faults, she is still a brave and strong character. Trust me, don't be intimadated by its size. It will probably be the best book you ever read.",
            "I love the movie Gone With the Wind, so I decided to read the book. I read the whole, 1,000-plus page book in a week! It's every bit as good, if not better. It is much better at explaining history and certain situatuions than the movie. (If you didn't understand the buisiness about the attack at Shantytown in the movei, read the book for a better understanding.) Margaret Mitchell also gives vivid, loving descriptions of the Old South, though I had to skim most of them so they wouldn't slow me down! She also gives vivid characterizations of all the main characters and quite a few more who weren't in the movie. The story is very enthralling and never boring. I definitly recommend it.",
            "This book is magical. It is enthralling and hard to peel your eyes away from. It is a delight to read and when you pull yourself away your mind is still in the old South. I found myself often dazed when I wasn't reading it. It is time consuming. Though this book is fantastic I both loved and hated the ending. It just didn't feel right. Like it wasn't finished and it desperatley needed a sequal. It would have been wonderful if Margaret Mitchell had written the sequal but she didn't so A. Ripley gave it her best shot. Although she is critizised for it I thought is was good as I don't believe GWTW is finished without the most famous characters of all time; Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler, together and in love.",
            "Margaret Mitchell's timeless classic, Gone With the Wind, is a book about young, Scarlett O'hara, who is madly in love with another woman's husband. She struggles through the hardships of the Civil War, supporting herself and her family. Her story is one of the strongest I have ever read. I recommend this book to everyone-it has just the right amount of romance, sadness, and truth in it to make it one of the greatest books.",
            "This book is absolutely fantastic. I am 14 years old and believe me at the beginnning I absolutely loathed my best friend when she tried to convince me to read this book. She was so persuasive that I finally relented.....and I dont regret it one bit. THis book was so captivating that I found it so hard to put it down. Margaret Mitchell has indeed done a fantastic job. Her descriptions are excellent and the conversations are well written indeed. This book is definitely a must read for all those who love Classical novels for it is unique and quite unbeatable.",
            "Gone With the Wind is a great book about a young woman named Scarlett O'Hara who is selfish and cares only about herself as she struggles to keep herself alive during the Civil War. If you enjoy reading stories during the Civil War, this is the book for you.",
            "Gone with the wind is definately my favorite book of all time. Margaret Mitchell portrays Scarlett and Rhett and everyone else with such detail that i felt i was watching it all happen. Every joy, every sorrow.... It is absolutely impossible to put down!!! My suggestion: read it on a weekend with nothing planned, and keep a box of tissues nearby. (can't wait to read the sequel, Scarlett)",
            "I've loved GWTW since I first saw it at the age of 12, but it wasn't until I was almost 30 before I read the book and boy was I surprised! Scarlett had more than one child! Margaret Mitchell wrote about characters other than those in the movie and once you read the novel, you'll wonder how Selznick was ever able to get the movie made. What a story. What an author. Read it and finally understand.",
            "This is the world's best book EVER! I have read hundreds of books, and not one rivaled this one! If you never read another book in your whole life, read this one. It is so amazing. You can't put it down. MM spins a web around you and you are trapped until the book is through. For two days after I read the book, I talked of nothing but the book (I am dead serious-ask my mom) Scarlett changed my life, she inspired me, she taught what to do- and what NOT to do. This book is the greatest.",
            "This book is the best book I have read in a long time.Although I first saw the movie, I was enchated with the book.Gone with the wind takes place around 1862, when the civil war strikes in The United States and tells the story and problems that Scarlett O'hara had to face.She is a spoiled and stubborn woman and that's why she never realizes the love she feels for Rhett Butler.Both of the main characters are stubborn persons,they love each other but in the same time they distrust their feelings.Rhett believed that Scarlett was in love with Ashley Wilkes and she believe he spent his time with another woman.Their distrust makes tem try to hurt each other in every way and they never get time to tell their feelings. The story is sad,romantic,historical and wonderfully written and the end surprises every one who read it.I completely loved this story and I recommended it to everyone who wants to read a true book.This classical novel will bring you to a world where you never imagined you could be when you read a book.There will never be a book such as.... GONE WITH THE WIND.",
            "Your initial reaction after seeing the movie is, &quot;How could this be any better than the movie?&quot;. But when you start in on the 1,000+ page epic. Your questions are answered in a few short paragraphs. Mitchell did her research and managed to produce on of the finest authoring efforts the history of American literature has ever seen. She managed to intertwine bits of her own life into the novel and provided her readers with a brilliant pallet of realistic characters. If there is any book that could make a reader weep, this is it. However, you have to keep warm while reading this to keep the goosebumps down.",
            "This is an amazing book. Suspensfull, and romantic, i was hooked by the first chapter. This classic story is the romantic tale of Scarlett O'Hara Hamilton Kennedy Butler, the strong, smart women of the civil war. The book tells the story of her growth as a person, her strength, her willfullness, and is an ongoing source of delight, tears, and endless romance. I recommened it to everyone and anyone. It is my very favorite book. Margaret Mitchell weaves a colorful and expressive masterpiece, and i am all praise! Read this book!",
            "Gone with the wind is an all time classic. This book is about a girl named Scarlett O'Hara who has a wonderful life until war breaks out and her world is turned upside down.She has to learn the basics to surviving but it comes with difficulty. Along the way she loses two husbands but has one final one which lasts. His name is Rhett Buttler. He helps her become a rich woman again. But is she truly happy? You will have to read to find out. Through all of this there is a moral which is, don't take what you have for granted and apprciate what you have because one day you may not have it.",
            "This book is by far the greatest love story of all time. The ignorant Scarlett O'hara is accustomed to getting her way all the time, but suddenly her once so stable, cushioned life falls out from between fingers. Choosing which dress to wear to balls used to be the issue, now Scarlett must struggle to find each meal, not only for herself but also for the family she supports. As the end of the war begins to approach Scarlett is a young woman who has seen the worst, and still hopes for the best. This book if the timeless tale of a Confederate blockader and a fiesty Southern belle.",
            "Gone With the Wind will totally blow you away, it surely blew me away. This book is a classic love story. It totally draws you in with the push-pull relationship between the main characters, Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara. It makes you want to scream at Scarlett because she just pushes Rhett away unknowingly, and Rhett is trying to pull her into love with money and luxurious clothes. This book is a good book because the events could happen in our time, marry for money and make your selves misreable, but who knows how it could end. If you enjoy books that make you throw them down in frustration, but pick them back up again just to find out what happens next, this book is definitely good for you. If you enjoy this book or were unhappy with the ending, breeze through Scarlett, the sequel to Gone with the Wind. Gone With the Wind is an outstanding book and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys suspense and love all mixed together in a great book.",
            "i think this book is wonderful!i've always liked Gone with the Wind,but when my mom bought it for me,i looked at it and it was so huge,that it took me a long time to finally start reading it.but when i did,not even a bomb could of stopped me from putting it down.i read it every time a got a chance to(between commercials,before school,after school,from 6 to midnight)i even stopped doing everything else i used to do just so i could read it.it is so well written,that you know the characters in and out,even though you never met them.i knew what the characters were like,but just like in real life,there was just so much to know about them,that it's impossible to describe a character.this is the first book and movie that has ever made me cry.when,finally,at the end of the book,scarlett realized that she loves rhett, and not ashley,it's too late and the sad ending(at that time) seemed worse than anything i've ever had to think about.at first,i was mad at three people:rhett,scarlett,and ashley(if you can believe it).rhett-because he didn't tell scarlett that he loved her after they were married(at least not enought for scarlett)and scarlett is too childish to realize that all those things that he for her and her children is because he loves her.scarlett-because her stupid pride stopped her from telling him that she loves him in time and for not telling him that she was sorry for anything that she did or said.and ashley-for realizing and telling scarlett that he doesn't love her way too late.but,in spite of all this,i love this book and i will recommend this to anyone in a heartbeat.",
            "Margaret Mitchell's evergreen saga of the Civil War era has become a kind of cultural icon. This sprawling novel was her sole work, but what a book! Two of the leading protagonists, Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler, are perhaps the best known fictional characters in American literature. The saintly Melanie Wilkes and her reticent husband Ashley are also widely recognized.Northern writers have yet to produce a comparable work. Mitchell's novel plugs into the antebellum nostalgia of the south. Even though her writing arguably does not meet the high standards of gifted southern writers (such as Flannery O'Connor and company), her wonderful narrative skills continue to make this book an enduring best-seller, decade after decade.As generations of American booklovers will testify, &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is a highly rewarding, romantic must-read.",
            "Hello! I read this book because I felt like I had to( It's a classic) and I did think it would be extremely sentimental, soap opera- like and, in Germany where I live we say KITSCHIG. But after a few pages I realised that it was exciting, and I didn't put it down all day. The one thing I disliked was the Ku- Klux- Clan scenes. They all apreciated this terrible, violent clan. This made me angry.Scarlett is a great charakter. She's not sympathatic, but when finally her beloved ones die and turn away from her, you feel sorry for her. A must-have-read!!!!",
            "Gone with the Wind is the most amazing novel ever! I read it in 8th grade for a school project and was so engrossed all 1,024 pages took me just two weeks! Living in the \"North\", I had never really thought about how hard it was for the \"South\" because I assumed they brought it on themselves. This book really opened my eyes and I'm glad it did. I love it so much that this year ... I read it again, just for fun, during the school year and it only took me two weeks again!! I highly recomend this novel to anyone and everyone in the world!",
            "I am not sure how anyone can read the book and not see the love story. It may come near the end, but yes it is there. Gone With the Wind is one of the best books ever written. It incorporates action, romance, drama... I often find myself using silly facts that you learn from the book. Gone With the Wind gives the modern public a look at what life was like for a Southern plantation owner during the Civil War, and no book will ever challenge the status Gone with the Wind has achieved.",
            "This book had everything I like to read about in it. From the vivacious Scarlett, to the loyal Melanie, to the blatant Rhett, the soft Ashley, and all the others, this book has it all. It includes comedy, tragedy, history, emotion, and many other things. My favorite character was Melanie. Scarlett drove me nuts. You get so pulled into the book that I actually stopped reading for a while because Scarlett was eing so mean to Melanie!! Definately a must read in the life of a true gentleperson.",
            "&quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is one of those impossible-to-put-down sagas that everyone should read. It is a perfect read in the summer-nearly 1000 pages to keep you reading throughout those long, lazy days. &quot;Scarlett O'Hara was not beautiful, but men seldom realized it&quot;...from the first lines of the book we are enchanted. And the passionate, emotional story of Scarlett O'Hara is the story of a how a war changed Scarlett's life, the story of how a pampered Southern belle became a woman changed by terrible circumstances. It is a love story, a story of one person, and story of Civil War-era South.There are a couple of key things that make this book the classic that it is. First, Margaret Mitchell really is one of those &quot;born&quot; storytellers. She is wonderful with description, and makes us &quot;feel&quot; things, yet seems to know exactly how much description is too much or too little. She effortlessly creates a seamless story taking place over many years, with never a dull moment on any one of the 954 pages. That alone is enough to make a novel &quot;stand out&quot;.&quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is also filled with vibrant characters. Margaret Mitchell's effective descriptions and keen insights into the minds of each character make this book even better. There is Scarlett, whose stubborn streak, determined mind, and desperate love we see and identify with; there is Melanie, sweet, trusting, and fiercely loyal (she happens to be my favorite character); there is Rhett, the puzzling, reckless, and mysterious blockader who is much like Scarlett; and there is Ashley, the one love that Scarlett cannot have.The only thing about this book that ISN'T absolutely perfect is the racism. Like many Southerners at that time, Margaret Mitchell had a very biased opinion of black people and their place in society. It was disturbing to read descriptions such as &quot;their monkey-like faces&quot; and &quot;darkies need to be treated like children&quot; in this book. However, I think this was in the book because that was how it WAS in the South then, not necessarily because the author thought it SHOULD BE that way. Racism is certainly wrong, but that was a part of the Southern way of life before, during, and after the Civil War.&quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is a wonderfully captivating book filled with characters that we can all identify with. Read it and you'll certainly see why this book, first published in 1936, is still popular today.",
            "I first read this book and saw the movie 35 years ago as a young teenager. Seeing that it was the 75th anniversary of the book, I decided to pick it up again. I am so glad I did. I didn't remember much about the book or movie after all these years.Mitchell did a fantastic job of describing people and settings. The story is about romance, family, survival, loss and determination. The characters are presented as real people with both good and bad points. Scarlett is manipulative and selfish for the most part but also loyal to her family when times are hard. Melanie is ever so sweet and innocent but we also see she is smarter than she first appears. Ashley is book smart and brave on the battlefield but is stuck in following the rules of conduct he has been taught his whole life. Rhett can be selfish and mean but deep down he really cares about people.I have lived in Georgia all my life. I grew up near Macon, where Sherman's troops marched. My 7th grade Georgia History teacher was a huge Civil War buff and made sure we learned more than just what was in the classroom history book. We saw the places the troops fought, we heard the stories handed down through the generations of the war, we read newspaper articles from that time period. Most of us were descended from people who experienced the war in their backyard. Often historical novels have twisted facts to fit the story, but the historical and geographical details of this book are accurate.For the critics who say this book is racist, you need to understand it is based on one view point of the south at that time. Not all Southerners owned slaves, very few owned plantations the size of the fictional Tara. Many slaves were mistreated, and of course owning another person is wrong. Rich whites did look down on poor whites. Whites did look down on blacks. But that is what happened at the time. The book isn't glorifying racism. It is just describing how a rich white family saw things during the 1860's in Georgia.Also, many of the men fighting were not slave owners but were just trying to protect their family. They did what most of us would do if we felt someone was coming to hurt and kill our families. Lincoln didn't set out to free the slaves. His main objective was to preserve the country as one entity.",
            "One of the best novels I've ever read. Margaret Mitchell has a way of bringing the reader into a tumulus period in the United States history. Near 1000 pages but easy to read and informative to what Southerners went through. Should be required reading in high schools of the U.S.",
            "Ever read a good book? My favorite book is Gone With the Wind. The Main characters are Scarlett O'Hara, Ashley Wilkes (BOY), and Melanie Hamilton. Since Scarlett is mensioned more often, we'll call her the mainest character. Scarlett is selfish, arrogant, hypocrative, and just down right mean!In this story, Scarlett is in love with Ashley. Ashley is to marry his cousin, Melly,( Sick right?), even though he loves Scarlett. Though Scarlett tries to make him jealous by marrying other men, Ashley stays loyal to his frail wife. Then, Scarlett, after 2 marriges that ended in the husband's death, comes upon a broad-backed, strong, handsome, rich, Charlestonian man. In the end, Scarlett ends up with her 3rd husband, leaving her with 2 children from previous marriges, one dead child, no friends, a large house, and oodles of money! Isn't this what she's wanted?Although this story is from evil Scarlett's point of view, it's still a wonderful story full of action, romance, sad and happy times, and hilarious scenes that don't quite seem to fit. Scarlett does the most hilarious things to get Ashley to notice her and he does many in return. I think that this book should be for 8th grade and up. If you're a boy you have to LOVE romance to like this and ladies don't need to be any personality or like any types of books, because there's things for all appeal.CAUTION: This book may lead to much dictionary research and much more study of the Civil War!",
            "This is a story about the life of a spoiled, selfish woman, Scarlett, going through the civil war period. It gives you an understanding of south's point of view. Several reviewers complained that it is racist. I would agree with those people but I don't like reading books that I agree with all the time. I found it valuable to try to understand what motivated the south to fight to preserve slavery. It seemed Mitchell was almost trying to defend slavery; if this offends and upsets you, then perhaps this may not be an enjoyable book for you.The character development is outstanding in this book. I constantly found myself comparing the book's characters with people I know. I've read many Michener books, which are also long historical fictions. I enjoy his books a lot, but this was far better than any of his books due primarily to her excellent character development.This book will stay with me forever.",
            "This will always be my all-time favourite book. The most sumptuous and vivd imagery. Such intriguing and authentic characters. And of course Scarlett is one of the most fascinating women in literary history precisely because she is so ahead of her time and dared to be different. I just love her though I certainly don't like her much!As much as I adore the movie as well, particularly the exquisite Vivien Leigh, it doesn't capture even half the richness of the novel.This is one book I re-read every few years and continue to find new elements to fascinate every time.",
            "I was out of non-fiction and had to settle for a novel, so why not the most famous of all? A smart move! I've read many historical accounts of the Civil War from many perspectives: The North, the South, the general, the private, the battle, the location, the time period,, and there is even one from the point of view of a horse! This is Scarlett O'Hara's view from her plantation, Tara, outside of Atlanta. What a refreshing perspective! The story is grand and Mitchell's graphic style keeps the images flashing onto every page. Yes, Scarlett is a bitch, but that just makes her all the more desirable. Yes, this is a \"girl's book,\" as was often pointed out to me, but guys can show their feminine side while reading of General Sherman laying waste to Georgia! A tip: See the movie first, it's a good introduction to the book. I read the book first and then saw the movie. The movie was so condensed that it almost seemed to run on fast-forward.",
            "I've seen the movie so many times I can recite it. But the book is so much better!! For lovers of the movie, you have to suck it up and take on 1024 pages of passion, despair, and the most amazing love story ever.I love Scarlett and yet at the same time I want to wring her neck. I wish I had Rhett Butler - I'd treat him right!! At the end of the book, just like the end of the movie, I ended up with tears running hopelessly down my cheeks.In addition to the adventures of a spirited young woman from Georgia, Scarlett also reveals much truth about the devastation witnessed in Georgia throughout the war and during the terrible years of Reconstruction.It's a gem to be treasured, and read over again.",
            "Margaret Mitchell presents characters whose depth is astonishing, and depictions of varied relationships that can reach the reader on numerous levels. This is not merely a love story or glorified version of a tragic historical period, but an intense treatment of much of the paradox in human nature.Regarding the racial issue - I would say that the depiction of blatant racism in this book is all the more powerful because everything is told from the Southern aristocrat's point of view. The characters need to believe, and have convinced themselves, that they are benevolent and affectionate towards their slaves! Yet they refer to these same people as &quot;apes&quot; without seeing their own horrifying stance. When Melanie, supposedly the soul of kindness, tells Ashley that, if they move North, they cannot let Beau attend school and &quot;have pickaninnies in his class,&quot; it shows the horror of racism just as clearly as if the reader had seen the miserable lot of the slaves.Scarlett, certainly no heroine and one with no principles who'd like merely the reputation for being a &quot;great lady,&quot; is a most intriguing character. As Margaret Mitchell makes clear in many references, we have here one who is incapable of being at all analytical. (Except for Rhett, and, to some extent, Gerald, only Mammy can see through Scarlett's facade.) The Ashley she loves is a creation of her imagination - and it is interesting that, for all that she despises Melanie, the traits Melanie has which Scarlett most derides are very much the same as those in the Ellen that she idolises.The book has so many fascinating characters that one could read it ten times and still find one has only scratched the surface. Those like myself, who cannot imagine too many settings they'd like to enter less than the &quot;old South,&quot; can find it interesting to explore the situation of those who find their entire world has collapsed around them.",
            "Gone With The Wind is the best book ever written short of the Bible.I have heard people say it's rascist- my opinion is why sugarcoat everything that happened in the Civil War? I think there was rascism at the time the book takes place. The book was written with exhaustive historical truth- if you make it sound like blacks ran around in tuxedos, then you undermine their suffering. And make the book unreal.People did suffer, but not all slaves suffered.If you're looking for a superbly written romance, if you are smart enough to see through people, you will love GWTW. IF you can't, you won't be able to see how Scarlett, shrewd, hard, proud, stubbern, is also smart, learns how to yield, proud as a virtue, and persistant. She complains and dreams the whole time she saves Tara but through sheer grit she does it and saves the people on it.You maybe cannot see how Rhett Butler loves this unseeing woman with complete passion, devotion- 'as much as a man can love a woman'. How the dishonest blockade runner goes crazy when his adored little girl dies. How he is a real daddy to Scarlett's other fatherless children.Read this book--- it is all about people. Anytime we can see ourselves in something, with a small sense of guilt we indenify and fall in love with it.GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!!!",
            "I loved this book! The most amazing thing about GONE WITH THE WIND (and there are many) are the beautiful characters that Mitchell creates. I felt pain, and laughter right along with Scarlett. All the characters seemed so real to me, and I grew to love them so. Mitchell is so brave to have not made a person like Melanie as the main character, a person that everyone would love. Instead she forces the reader to fall in love with a selfish, stubborn, mean, hateful person like Scarlett. Scarlett is definetly my favorite literary figure, she is by no means a perfect person, but you see parts of yourself in her, parts that you may not want to see, and that makes her all the more real. True to form, the most interesting characters in the book are the people with more sinister sides to themselves. To compliment Scarlett, there is of course, Rhett Butler. Every episode he was in came to life, just by the addition of his witty back handed comments, and his insightfullness to realize just how unscrupulous he and others are. Every diolouge is a joy, be it anyone from Prissy, to Rhett speaking, the words fly fromt the page, and never get boring. The turns that the book takes never fail to surprise. Once I got into this book, I couldn't put it down. The most important thing to remember while reading it though, is to take the book as it is. In parts, tales of the blacks lording over the whites, and the views of slaves, are hard to swallow, and painful to read. And they are not entirely accurate. But this was written by a southerner, in a different time, about an EXTREMELY different time, so all of these things must be taken in stride, and read with caution. Over all, this is a book that which will tear at your heart, make you cry with laughter, and, even make you fall in love with an ignorant, racist, Southern Belle.",
            "Let me make a simple statement: This novel is a perfect interpretation of the Antebellum bourgeousie South. Margaret Mitchell was born in the early 1900s and therefore the stories she heard, the ones that inspired this novel, were admittedly a bit skewed.HOWEVER, there is a lot of truth to Gone with the Wind, whether people like it or not, and beyond that, this novel is probably the perfect love story because it is so heartbreaking and so imperfectly human. Whether or not you agree with the portrayal of slavery, the Civil War, the Reconstruction, etc. that this novel presents, it is unfair to dismiss the greatness of Gone with the Wind. You can read all the Twain, Faulkner, Fitzgerald that you like, but until you have read this book, you do not have the full picture of American literature.",
            "Epic. Heart-rendering. Encouraging. I don't know where to start.If you have not read this book, I highly recommend it. If you have already read it, treat yourself to another read.\"Gone with the Wind\" is a book that I have read annually from the time I was a teenager. The characters keep calling me back. The story reaches out and grabs me. So, I go back every year for a visit with the characters who seem so real and present to me.What speaks to me the most is Scarlett, herself. Despite hardship, she provides for the people around her. She is determined. Scarlett is taught from childhood that who she is fundamentally is wrong and she should try to be someone else...and she does try for a while. (Does this seems familiar to any of us ladies today?) Only Rhett sees her for her true self and appreciates it. Despite being a renegade, he keeps his word, loves Scarlett and Bonnie (their daughter) honestly and deeply, while carelessly providing luxuries and lavishing them with attention. A real man!!!!! Mitchell's characters are complex, true, and touching.Also, Mitchell brings the battles of the American Civil War to life. The battles are explained in a style that is compelling and breath-taking.Scarlett and Rhett are people who are real and live life with passion and strength. If you want to meet Scarlett or flirt with Rhett, all you have to do is open the book and read as the past come to life.Happy reading!",
            "Gone with the Wind is one of the best books ever written, maybe the best.I can not even express how much I love this book.Many people disregard Gone With the Wind as a just a lenthy romance, but this is NOT what it is. Gone with the wind is SO much more than a romance. It is, for one, a book about the Civil War from the Southern people's perspective. This book gives the reader a brand new perspective on the Civil War and it is refreshingly NOT like all the other mundane Civil War books. It is full of history, but there is never a boring moment: Margret Mitchell is a brilliant writer whose beautiful and exciting descriptions, livily dialoge and none-stop story keep the book engrossing and never boring. I couldn't put it down!Again, Gone with the WInd is not just a romance, as I said, it is a refreshing Civil War book; but it is not only that. Gone with the wind has many suspensful, dangerous, and sometimes violent moments, such as The Burning of Atlanta or the event when Scarlett shoots a Yankee invader.The characters of GWTW are immortal. Each character is so beloved to so many readers, and there is a good reason why. Every character has his own fascinating personality. Every type of person, from selfish to greedy to tragic to stupid to controlling to timid to utterly kind is expressed in the book's countless engrossing characters.The story line is also wonderful. It is very complex but never confusing; it has such a good main plot and so many intriuging sub-plots.For the reasons I have attempted to state above and for so many more, Gone with the Wind is a beloved American Classic that has endured and will endure for many years to come.Whether are a man or woman, girl or boy, old or young, READ THIS BOOK!You will not regret it.And it just may be, that after you have entered the world of Gone with the Wind, you will find in it a new favorite that is worth reading over and over again.",
            "Margaret Mitchell was a genius. This book is so detailed and interesting it is hard to describe. Do not judge it by the movie. It is a very accurate portrayal of life before, during and after the War Between the States, in the South. Scarlett was not always an admirable character, but she was not boring.",
            "The love story is very well known and beautiful. If you want a great romance you won't be disappointed.However, the story behind the romance is what really made this book wonderful for me. It questioned what happens to people when society changes. What's great is that it shows many people's responses to the change. It reminded me of Chinua Achebe's THINGS FALL APART.The characterizations and descriptions are wonderful. I found this book to be very engaging and real. I would recommend it to anyone.",
            "Most will have seen the movie before ever considering reading this remarkable book. The \"bones\" of the movie are in the book, but the novel has so many more characters and details that it really makes for an excellent read. More background on Scarlett and the others and everything is much more fleshed out. Great.",
            "LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the book! What an amazing story line. It is entertaining, heart pounding at times, and very real. You can relate to the characters at times and hate them all at the same time. I think anyone will be happy to read this book and not feel like it was a waste of time. Happy Reading!!!",
            "This is one of my favorite books. Don't get me wrong, it has its faults - sometimes too-slow pacing, and deeply embedded racism to name a few. But we don't love things because they are perfect, or because of their morality. We love them because they touch us.As this book touched me.How can I explain the affecting emotion aroused in me by stubborn, foolish, sensible fiery Scarlett? Or the adoration of tough, roguish Rhett? Or the kinship I felt with the both of them? By that last, perhaps.This book is a historical romance, member of a genre known for its cliches. But it is no Harlequin. I have read enough of that genre, and am not a fan. This book is part of a genre known for crappiness, yet the romance between Rhett and Scarlett is real, not contrived, and feels real. Mitchell has accomplished what many have tried and failed to do, here: to write a strong romance novel that even readers of the non-sappy sort can enjoy.And the racism, that, too, has a purpose, though I doubt Mitchell intended it insomuch as it just was, because she herself was racist. A lot of historical novels (bad ones, at least) take characters from certain places and times, and make them into MODERN people, with MODERN values, misunderstood and inexplicably ahead of the times. Scarlett is a southern belle in the civil war south. This is the setting of the novel. Does she 'break the rules' at times? Yes. But she does not do it on every single count, and any messages thus conveyed are not overtly preachy. Mitchell has created something that is simultaneously believable, and yet transcendent, sometimes heroic, and larger-than life.",
            "I am only 11 years old. Still, no one stopped me from reading the classic, Gone With the Wind. I encourage myself. When I started reading the book, I got so caught into Scarlett, Ashley WIlkes, Melanie, and Rhett Butler, that I felt as if I were living with them as well! When I got to the end of the book, I felt as if Margaret Mitchell had left out something very valuable, like she hadn't really meant to publish the un-finished book! I am getting very crazy about Gone With the Wind, and it's truly the first book that I can ever say sincerely that was my \"Favorite book\" ever! For anyone who thinks Gone With the Wind's words are too small, or that the book is too \"mushy and gushy for us,\" it's not! It's a nice, sad romance novel that I shall remember forever. Please read it. I am currently asking for the book, in hardcover original edition, for my birthday.",
            "I LOVE THIS BOOK!! Rhett Butler is one of the best characters when it comes to writing and so is Melanie, and Scarlett. Mitchell outdid herself in this classic novel. I love the movie too, but the book is much better with so much more detail. Yes, Scarlett is a little whiny and selfish and takes Rhett for granted, but I love her anyway! Ashley is a huge git, but you have to like a lot of the other characters inculding Aunt Pitty-pat and Melanie. This book is 5 Stars and nothing can change that. I hope Mitchell is smiling down from heaven when she sees us reading her book-because it is a true gem.",
            "While I admit to not being a fan of the romance genre, Mitchell's &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; towers above its imitators in style and substance. Set in the Atlanta area during the Civil War era, Mitchell's story exemplifies the proper writing of historical fiction, with painstaking accuracy of language, mannerisms, and morals. The war itself is also presented as it should be presented - in full color and with all its moral ambiguity, rather than the black-and-white presentation that so often is the norm in modern discourse.Mitchell's painting of southern culture and the all-encompassing war, however, serve only as the background for one of the most poignant love stories ever written. Following the life and loves of the willful Scarlett O'Hara, the work delves straight into the meaning and nature of love. Torn between her now-married childhood love, Ashley, and the outcast Rhett Butler, and in dogged pursuit of financial success after the devastating war, Scarlett lives a life of emotion and passion that few fictional characters have rivalled.Though this work is quite long, it is a very easy read. The style is light and brisk, the language uncomplicated except in the heavy dialect of the blacks, and the story compelling. &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; is a great book, a great movie, and perhaps the greatest love story ever told. Highly recommended.",
            "I began this novel in the 11th grade prepared to hate it to the core. Everything I knew about it made me expect a silly, eye-batting trip into a fairy tale world of the Old South with its impossibly virtuous ladies, its foppish gentleman and grinning content slaves, and I was actually looking forward to making fun of the characters, story and author.I could NOT have been more wrong about this novel. Margaret Mitchell, I salute you!This is to American letters what Les Miserables is to France, or War And Peace is to Russia. Nowhere else are characters like these to be found or is the human spirit portrayed as so unconquerable. I fell in love with this book. From its would-be detractor I became its most vocal champion. I was stunned over and over at how inutterably magnificent this contribution to literary greatness was. As one reads along about the lives of these larger than life men and women all set against the backdrop of the fall of an entire civilization, any sensitive person can only be compelled to acknowledge that there on the open page is a book that shall live in literary eternity.Of any work of fiction a person might feel compelled by \"duty\" to read at some point in a lifetime, Gone With The Wind deserves to be at the head of that list.",
            "This is a wonderful leatherette version, with a self ribbon place marker and a lovely gold dark gold and blue cover and heavy fine paper, with plenty of cloth fiber used in the making of the paper. This makes a better grade of paper only used in the best of books and stationary.They just don't make them like this any more!Chaska",
            "Gone with the Wind is a timeless, sweeping, epic masterpiece of American literature. It is the story of the South right before the Civil War, during the war, and the aftermath when Reconstruction began in the South. It is filled with drama, romance, tragedy, real characters with flaws, and I can see why this book won a Pulitzer Prize and why it continues to be a very popular book decades after it was first published in 1936.I don't need to go into a synopsis of the book, if anyone hasn't heard of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler, I'd be very surprised. If you have only seen the wonderful movie adaptation of the book, but have never read the book, I highly recommend you read the book. The movie doesn't capture the essence of the characters, the entirety of their personalities and motives behind certain actions and behaviors.I was captivated from the very first page. I can't describe exactly how or why, but Mitchell wrote in such a way that pulls you into the story. Her writing is simple and straightforward, and it touches you in a way that helps you relate to the characters and the world she wrote about. Her writing resonates with you, and keeps you reading. Her writing of the scenery and backdrop of the South, her depictions of the various characters, their motives, their thoughts, their innermost secrets that make them who they are. Mitchell brought this time period to life and causes you, the reader, to empathize with the characters and the struggles and upheaval they go through.Even though I know this story, how it unfolds and how it concludes, I couldn't turn the pages fast enough until I reached the very end. Scarlett O'Hara isn't the most sympathetic character you'll encounter, but as I gradually read her story, I found myself liking this character and rooting for her happily ever after, although you know she doesn't get that HEA in the end. I actually found the ending appropriate, it fits in with Scarlett's personality of a person who won't quit no matter what. She has seen the worst in life, and she remains stubborn in defeat that she can win back Rhett's love.Scarlett was a very selfish, manipulative, and cruel young woman, the only person she cared about was herself (with the exception of her mother, Ellen O'Hara, who she revered and respected and was the only woman she trusted). She was a simple person, not easily able to understand more serious and complex issues, which she usually shrugged off in a careless fashion as insignificant and unworthy of her time. She presented a facade of a lady of gentility to the world, all the while seething secretly inside at what she perceived as injustices against her or the unfairness of life if she didn't get her way. She was also willfully stubborn in her unrequited love for childhood friend, Ashley Wilkes, and it was quite sad to see her pine for a man who rejected her even though he did love her but was too cowardly to do anything about it.Despite her numerous character flaws, Scarlett had some admirable traits, such as her perseverance and flinty determination to survive. There were so many times where she was numb with weariness and feeling desolate at the heavy burden on her shoulders, but she would always put off her morose thoughts and say, \"I will think about it later\", and mentally force herself to take it one step at a time in order to stay sane and calm in a chaotic world. This was in contrast to her weak sisters who couldn't seem to comprehend that their old lifestyle had vanished forever and that a change was needed within themselves in order to survive. Scarlett, with her unladylike blunt honesty and very practical nature realizes this almost immediately. She was so unlike her tender and kind mother, Ellen, in almost every way except in one. Like her mother before her, she became the mistress of Tara, and in her newfound role she fills her mother's shoes in becoming what her family needed. Someone to look up to and lean upon for aid when needed.I found Scarlett a contradiction of sorts. She would look upon in contempt or disgust at those who depended on her, yet she would cast such thoughts aside in order to fulfill her duty to them as she couldn't abandon them. For her family because they *were* family and an O'Hara always helped family, and for Melanie, Ashley's wife, because of a promise. On the one hand she was a strong woman, strong in that she was able to survive the devastation of the South and show a courage of spirit in facing adversity and impossibility, but on the other hand, she was weak too. Weak in continuing in her girlhood, idealistic, puppy love for Ashley that blinded her to real, true lasting love with Rhett Butler who was her true soul mate. In some ways she was finally a woman, having the burden of responsibility of her family forcing her to mature, but in other ways, in her relationship with men, she was still a child. Of course, in the latter category she realizes too late what she knew instinctively all along, that Rhett Butler was the man for her and she had just been too immature, stubborn, and childish to see it clearly.Rhett Butler was the perfect match for fiery Scarlett. He was exactly like her, unscrupulous and looking to number one first (although, he did have his gentlemanly and kind moments beneath the veneer of mockery and sardonic amusement). Unlike Scarlett, he didn't pretend to be what he was not. He was no refined Southern gentleman and he took perverse pleasure in flaunting this in subtle ways. He is basically Scarlett in masculine form, only more intelligent.Some of my favorite moments of the book were the scenes with Rhett and Scarlett sparring with the other. It was amusing to see Rhett get the upper-hand over Scarlett every time. His witty quips most times went completely over her head, as she wasn't as clever as he, but that made it all the more amusing to see Scarlett finally meet her match in Rhett. I laughed aloud several times as I read Scarlett getting frustrated and upset stating he was no gentleman, only to see him laugh at her and agree with her he wasn't. Other scenes I enjoyed reading was the scenes back at Tara after she fled Atlanta, where you are witness to the transformation of Scarlett the Southern belle to Scarlett the survivor as she toiled in the cotton fields in Tara and tried to put food on the table for her family.I thought it was quite saddening to read about the delusions people in the South had regarding the war. The characters in Atlanta, such as Mrs. Merriweather or Dr. Meade, with their desperate, futile hope, and optimism that the South would prevail was sad to read about. Defiant to the end, in their naive and stubborn pride they thought the South and \"the Cause\" they fought for would triumph no matter the cost. It was this hope they clung to even as Atlanta was under siege by the Union army. None would know (or wanted to admit to knowing), except those perceptive enough to see the truth, such as Rhett Butler or Ashley Wilkes, that the way of life the South enjoyed up to the war was dead and gone. An old world that wouldn't come back, even if they had won, as it was forever changed, and like the title of the book gone with the wind. This book was poignantly sorrowful in that regard, you get a brief glimpse into the South portrayed pre-war and then post-war, and you realize it was never to be the same again.Although this story is told from the perspective of a Southern woman and her story of surviving the war, I think one could say her personal story reflects on a larger scale the entire South's struggles to survive in a new and changed world. The scenes of the ruined and abandoned plantations, with their eerie tomb stillness, was described in very convincing detail, and I found myself with Scarlett mourning the lost world she loved and grew up in.I could keep on writing about the various aspects of this story that were enjoyable and what I thought, but this review would get very lengthy if I did! Let me say this: the book was wonderful. Just read it! You won't regret it, yes, it is quite a hefty book but this story is so engrossing, compelling, and captivating you won't even notice how long the book is.",
            "This is my favorite book of all time. Maay critics of today have harsh criticism for this book, but a book is not always ment to meet current day social standards, it is supposed to take you away and entertain you. This is exactly what GWTW does and quite superbly I may add. If you are looking for an enchanting story if survival, adventure, romance, and whimsy, than do not hesitate to buy this book.",
            "What can I add that has not already been said about this novel? It truly is one of the best novels ever written. I read over 75 books every year, many of them historical novels. I don't know why I waited so long to read this one, but I'm glad I finally did. And no, I haven't seen the movie. The characters were multi-dimensional and despite their often-displayed negative qualities, we keep hoping for them. They are more real and probably like ourselves than most of us would care to admit. Perhaps that is the real beauty of the story. We can see how selfish actions can lead to consequences without having to live through the pain ourselves. The style is easy to read and enjoyable to follow. And the backdrop of the Civil War and the early reconstruction period (from the South's point of view) is among the best I've ever run across. Despite its length, the book keeps you enthralled, every step of the way. This is one of those classics that you simply must read, not because you should, but because you will be so glad you did.",
            "When my mom brought this home, at first I thought I wouldn't understand it. I started the book because I had seen the motion picture and fell in love with all of the characters. Once I started I could NOT stop! I read in the shower, I read while I was brushing my teeth, I read late into the night when I was supposed to be sleeping. I am only eleven years old but I still hold Gone With the Wind a treasure to my heart. My favorite character was Melanie. I became Melanie for the couple of weeks that I read this book. I adored Ashley and admired Rhett Butler. I read with intent interest at Scarlett's luxurious life,I struggled through the Civil War. I felt the O'hara family's hunger too. Even though I am young,I say this book is up there with the best literature there is!",
            "This is the greatest romance ever written, and at over 1000 pages long, most people will finish it within days, reading it in bed, at the table, in the bathroom, in the car, on the way to the mailbox, just because you can't put it down, and every page is a page-turner. Fantastic dialogue, fantastic scenery, fantastic character development. You'll remember whole passages and be able to quote from it.",
            "Great book. A must read, though whether or not you like it is up to you. I've loved this book since I was fourteen, and I think it is one of the best novels to ever come out of America.It drives me crazy when people say this book is racist. Really? A book written by a southerner, closely related to former slave owners? Racist? NO! The book is written about a south that the people of the south say and believed in, and the characters are all people who fit into this setting. This wasn't a story about enlightenment and aboltionism. It was a story about a woman in the south and the Civil War and reconstruction through her eyes. Not your eyes. Not the eyes of the northern aboltionists. Not the eyes of a slave. It was shown through the eyes of half the population of the US at the time, and that people try to nullify these views is wrong. This is the way people thought and felt, and villifying all slave owners (many of whom grew up in that society and didn't know much better) is no better than making all negroes stupid. In the end, it's a work of fiction. A book. Reading and enjoying it doesn't make someone a racist, and I would hope that people would please stop saying that. Don't like the book? Don't read it. I, for one, would say that books like \"The Wind Done Gone\" is no less racist, though there will be hell to pay if someone actually says it out loud.",
            "The summer I was 15, between Junior High and High School, my mother recommended that I read this book. Of course I wasn't going to listen to HER...so I pouted around for a few days, and then one evening, afraid I was going to succumb to utter boredom, I picked it up.For the next week, I did nothing but read Gone with the Wind. I read it every waking moment, far into the night, first thing in the morning. I remember having a perpetual headache from eyestrain. I simply could not stop until the last page, when I burst into tears, and sobbed for what seemed like hours.The book has much the same effect on me now. Every few years, I read it cover to cover, even though I can quote key passages by heart by this time. So let me tell you a little bit about Gone with the Wind, the first thing being that it is not what you think it is. It's hard to compete with David O'Selznick here, even though he's dead, but I beg you to put the movie aside, and prepare yourself for sheer, satisfying, bosom-heaving pleasure. This was a thoroughly amazing book in the thirties, and it wears well. It is much more than the story of spoiled, willful Scarlet O'Hara and her deadly flirtations. Scarlet may have been the first feminist. Women in her day had no power whatsoever. Their entire lives were decided by convention: whom they should marry, what they should eat, where they should live, what they should wear. But Scarlet would have none of it. And the only way she could break free of convention was to use her wiles to flaunt it. She did--and it worked. She was and is my hero, selfish and vain as she was.On quite another level, this is the heartbreaking story of the War Between the States from the Southern point of view. As a teen who was raised in California, I had no clue about how the South felt about the War, and no way to find out. This book, silly as some may find it, taught me that there are two sides to any conflict, two equally powerful and opposing points of view that are tragically at odds. Sound familiar? Not much different than the Middle East today.Now a word about the book's purported racism. Yes, there are slaves in this book, and I am not going to presume to tell you not to resent or be angry about that fact. But considering the time in which she lived, I think that Margaret Mitchell tried to deal with the issue of slavery as best she could. The slaves in the book are not the simpering fools of the movie. They are portrayed with as much dignity as I think Mitchell could manage when considering that there was no way she could condone OR ignore that slavery was a fact during the Civil War. Mammy is not a caricature in the book, Prissy is a much more sympathetic young woman, and the other slaves are portrayed as thinking, feeling, human beings.The Emancipation is not regretted, and is seen from the freed slaves' point of view as much as possible. That having been said, I am not advocating this book as something it is not. It is not an abolitionist work, and it is not anti-slavery per se. It is not anything more than phenomenally well-written story with a lot of truly interesting historical information about the 1860s and beyond.Gone with the Wind is the story of a lifetime, not the caliber of War and Peace, but for its time, incredibly good reading. Summer is almost upon us. This is a perfect time to sit under a magnolia tree with a mint julep and treat yourself to an old-fashioned story you'll never forget.",
            "This epic tale of Georgia during and after the Civil war is quite possibly one of the best literary works I've ever read. It is powerful and filled with completely three dimensional characters. It follows the struggles of Scarlett O'Hara through the harsh realities that women faced during the war and the determination not to starve and to rebuild her life after the fighting ended. Scarlett is a very strong woman-forthright and levelheaded and stubbornly practical. She is a product of the hardships she had to overcome in order to keep her family and herself alive. No, she isn't a likeable character. But it is her flaws that make her endearing. Melanie is a perfect angel and my favorite character. She seems weak on the surface, but she is the foundation for everyone around her. It is her quiet strength that helps everyone stand on their own two feet. You can't help but love her. This book will live in my mind for a long time. I'm so glad to have read it.",
            "Addressing the complexities between a man and a woman, this great American classic \"Gone with The Wind\", which takes place during the Civil War when the South was badly destroyed and crippled, comes to mind. There is really nothing that this reviewer can think of to match the intensity and dynamics between a temperamentally-suited couple such as Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler. The author, Margaret Mitchell, whose own life story is extremely interesting, leaves us at the end of her magnificent saga to determine in the mind of Scarlett as perhaps those of other readers, whether she is going to be resigned to a life of long regrets, or forge ahead 'Tomorrow' in search of her true love. A brilliant portrayal of war and passion between a man and a woman as Old Dixie goes up in flames. One of the best and enduring American love stories ever, Margaret Mitchell hailing from the South, wrote from her heart and about what she knew at the time while never pretending to be an intellect or an historian. And, to think that a vexed Mitchell would not have agreed to make such a splendid contribution to American literature if a friend of hers had not been overheard saying: 'Peggy is too silly to write a book!'.",

            "The fact that so many people still love this book just shows how racist we still are. It does NOT make it a good book just because you \"like\" it.Don't start with me about Mammy, or about how Scarlett O'Hara doesn't change at ALL throughout the book, except for getting \"tougher.\" Margaret Mitchell did much to immortalize the ridiculous fantasy of \"The South\" that we still cling to today. I'm not saying that there weren't good moments back in Antebellum days, but let's be realistic. In \"Reading Lolita in Tehran,\" the author (I have forgotten her name, may she forgive me) states somewhere that \"even if you're under a benevolent dictator, you're still under a dictator.\"And before I get screams of rage from people who probably also believe in wearing white at their wedding, just remember: just because YOU like it, doesn't mean it's not racist. Just read it with a new eye. That's all I ask. And if you claim that \"ruins\" it, then okay, good. There are plenty of books about plucky heroines that you can read instead, like Jamaica Kincaid's \"Annie John\" and \"Lucy\". Oh, and read \"A Small Place\" while you're at it, to read what Caribbean folks think about our jaunty little cruises down their way.It has to hurt for a while for people to change.",
            "Gone with the Wind is by far one of the best written books of our century. It takes us back through time, to a civilazation long since forgotten. To a time when all was well in the Old South, where beauty ran wild amidst the red clay of Georgia. From the outbreak of the Civil War in the view point of Georgian belle Scarlett O'Hara, to the end and beyond we become engrossed to the point where it is impossible to put the book down. The story follows the life of Scarlett O'Hara daughter of a wild Irishman and an aristocratic but kind French lady. We follow Scarlett through her weddings and her childbirths, through her long trip home to her beloved Tara. We experiance her rejection and her revilation that the land is the only thing that really lasts and the only thing worth fighting for. Through her pain and her misery, through her laughter, and her tears we laugh with her and cry with her. We feel the hardships of war and the fury of the aftermath, and we watch, as does Scarlett and the rest of the all star cast, the destruction of a civilazation that is truly Gone with the Wind. For everyone who loves the Old South, for anyone who loves a good book. Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind truly touches her readers, and makes one unforgettable novel.",
            "I finally read this book years after seeing the motion picture. I fell in love with the characters and found my sympathies and compassion straining towards those I hadn't imagined I could feel anything for... Rhett knew what he was getting into, yet he loved Scarlet despite all her fall-backs and the knowledge he'd always be in another man's shadow. Rhett and Melanie were my favourite characters because they were both strong people who had the courage to love. I agree this book could be seen as racist, yet I also believe it is a historical novel in some parts which does justice to the Southerners side of the story. Yes, none of us agree with slavery. However, those were the times and that's how life was. Margaret Mitchell is being true. She displays the sympathies of the time her book is set. Judging it by modern standards of racism is the same as judging Shakespeare by modern political correctness. You can't. I belive this is a beautiful book and a beautiful love story. I encourage anyone with an open mind and a compassionate heart to read it.",
            "This book is absolutely the best. You would have to be a fool not to enjoy this book. It is beautifully written, and extremely enjoyable. Its length is an excellent support, for if you are hungry for more, it is always coming. READ THIS BOOK AND YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPOINTED!",
            "I picked up this book from the library when I was only 11. Every time I read a book I have a new fave book,but this book is my very favorite. Scarlett O'Hara may be an absolute brat, but I love her. She's got spunk and sprit!Melanie is such a sweet charachter! Rhett is imposible, but hysericaly funny! This book takes you through 12 years of Scarlett's life. It is funny, touching, and very real. When I read this book, I laughed,pondered over certain ideas, and cried. This is an iresistible romance, which teaches leasons about life and love. I recomended this book to any one!",
            "This book is a very interesting one. Me being 14 years old, I didn't think I was going to like it at all because I'm not the fondest person of reading. But I found it very interesting, and easy to follow most of the time. It took me back to the time of the Civil War, and I felt I was actually there. I would recommand this book to amyone. Especially ones that are interested in Historical-Ficiton.",
            "Scarlett O'Hara is the ultimate survivor. She has more inner strength and passion than any man or woman in the story except, of course, for Rhett Butler. &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; is the kind of book that you don't just read; you actually live the story, and when you finish reading the last page, you are bereft because you miss the characters so much. The characters are so clearly defined you feel that you know them. The story of the finely detailed lives of every single character, told against the background of some of the most romantic, disburbing, and turbulent years of American history, is unparalled. It is a great tribute to Margaret Mitchell that her only published work is loved and revered by so many. Anyone who thinks he knows the story of &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; from seeing the movie is sadly mistaken. This story MUST BE READ to be truly appreciated!",
            "I not only have one dog earred copy of this book, I have two dog earred copies of this book on my nightstand. What a great book! Inspiring, thoughtful and interesting all at that same time. Yes, there are racist elements and sterotypical themes (the use of the \"n\" word is discusting and offensive and the view that the slaves were \"Happy\" was absolutely discusting). The issue of slavery was sugar-coated - the slaves were never depicted as being human beings with thoughts and feelings - they were just charactures meant to serve their Caucasian \"masters\". I enjoyed reading about the historical aspect of the Civil War. The characters of Scarlett and Rhett do not pretend to be something they are not - both are shrewd, focused, fiesty. Is Scarlett a spoiled little brat? Yes, of course she is, but somehow the author makes you want to root for her in the end because Scarlett fights for what she wants and never gives up. I think those are admirable qualities for any person to have.I agree with other posts that there was no reason for a sequel(s). The sequel really served no purpose other than to confirm what (most) of us already knew or hoped - that Scarlett and Rhett would end up together anyway.",
            "I think everyone either loves or hates this book-so here I'm just going to say that I love this book, and I really believe it is one of the finest novels ever written. Yes, it portrays black slaves as their owners saw them in the Civil war-as inferior people. But would it really have been historical fiction if it had been any other way? This is not just a novel about Scarlet and Rhett Butler-this is a book about the pre-civil war way of life in the South and the way the real southerners, the ones who lost their slaves and plantations and had to make a major adjustment on their viewpoints on race, lived. Scarlet and Rhett and Melony and Ashley-they are some of the best written characters ever created. And no, you shouldn't be able to understand their mindset. They lived a hundred and fifty years ago and no one today has a mindset like that. Good historical fiction should always put you in a mindset that it hard to understand and relate to-because otherwise it's just a character in the past with a modern mindset.Read this book if you want to know true history. The way the war is portrayed is gruesome and terrible, but like a car wreck you can't look away. The writing shows the true effect it has on the lives it touched and the horrible way it changed and damaged all the people who lived through it. It is fascinating, impeccably written as far as the historical facts go, and also romantic and enjoyable. I read this book every year and every time I love it. If you like historical fiction, read this book. If you like history, read this book. Even if you think this book is raciest and terrible, read the book. Understand a different viewpoint on history.Besides, the author was not a raciest at all. This is FICTION folks.This is the ultimate historical fiction, and every one should read it. From page one you will be trapped.So much more than five stars.",
            "Having just watched the movie recently after many years, I realized anew how wonderful the book is in comparison! Scarlett is more than just a money-hungry b****, Rhett is *much* more than the wimp who kept telling her he loved her in the movie, etc.I love GWTW because it's one of the few books that remains true to its characters. A happy ending was never possible for Rhett and Scarlett, because she saw him as more scoundrel than soul mate until the very end. He put up with *more* than enough from her before his love gave out, and he hid that love from her except on two memorable occasions.This is an interesting portrait of the South, and in turn, of Marget Mitchell herself. The racism in this novel never bothered me, because she was simply seeing life through the filter of her own life and experiences. Things were so different back then; how can anyone judge from today's perspective?I'd recommend this book to anyone. I read it first when I was 11 years old, but so much of the adult content and nuances went over my head that I wouldn't recommend this to children.",
            "Gone With The Wind is no doubt THE classic Civil War novel. However, the major characteristic that enables it to achieve its greatness also condemns Scarlet to a life of unrequited love and dooms her potential for happiness with Rhett. That attribute is that it is written entirely from the woman's viewpoint.The perspective is a strength because it permits the author to vividly portray the destruction of Southern society better than any battlefield-centered novel could. Regrettably, it also leaves the author, and therefore Scarlet as well, incapable of understanding the male characters. They are merely personalities that fade in-and-out of the background to shape the narrative. While they are characters that can stand up off the page and cast a shadow, there is no tone or timbre in their images.For example, Rhett notes that he was nearly killed stealing the horse to get Scarlet out of Atlanta before it was burned. But Mitchell does not describe the theft. Therefore, Scarlet (and Mitchell herself) cannot appreciate Rhett's ordeal or gain true insight into his character.In another instance the novel mentions that Rhett fought at the battle of Franklin. What Mitchell does NOT tell the reader is that Franklin was probably the bloodiest defeat of a Confederate army in the entire war. For Southern arms its horrors are unmatched by any of the better known battles in Virginia or elsewhere. Mitchell fails to narrate this experience and thereby misses yet another opportunity understand and appreciate Rhett.In short, since Mitchell herself failed to share much of Rhett's (or any man's) experiences, the chances that Scarlet could find true love were as slim as an Apache Indian getting elected Pope. Mitchell and Scarlet sought only to be understood and not to understand.",

P.S.- if you really liked GWTW, don't read the sequel, _Scarlett_. I'll tell you, it's pretty different from what I imagined.",

            "Margaret Mitchell was my Great-Great Aunt. From her, I inherited some of my facial characteristics,and also a talent for writing. I first read my aunts book when I was in 7th grade, and fell head over heels in love with it. It was a story that depicted the life from a southern point of view. In a vast majority of the Civil-War era novels, the Confederates are made out to be unruly rebels. Not ALL southerners were like that. Take The O'Hara family for example,did not treat their slaves badly, as many southern plantation owners were made out to be. I'm not denying the act of slavery as being horrible, for I know that it was, but at the same time, Margaret showed both sides. She showed the hardships and difficulties, loves and pleasures of southern life, and for that I am unbelievable proud to say that I am her blood.",
            "Not a bad novel for a first writer. It could almost be a classic except for a few points - a) it's unecessarily long and could have used more editing; b) the second half is weak and not very interesting; c) it's description of Reconstruction is very one-sided and half-correct and d)it's too racist. Other than that, it's not bad.",

            "I was one of those who disappeared for a few days until I finished the book. A great, spellbinding novel. With that said, the history in the book is terrible. This is such a warped perspective on slavery; it is history through the eyes of Simon LeGree. We are supposed to believe that the slaves really loved \"Massa\", instead of being kept in place by the lash, the chain, and the gun. Further, the Reconstruction governments in the South did some great things. The South has done an excellent job of rewriting history to make themselves look good. This novel is unfortunately the basis for many people's view of history of these times. We are supposed to feel bad that the \"glorious\" days of the slave plantation are \"gone with the wind.\"",
            "I am sorry , but I did not like Gone With The Wind(I am a senior in highschool and despite what everyone thinks about highschoolers, I am well read. And I have read books by James A Michener and John Jakes). I will admit that Scarlett has an amazing ability to survive, but it is only by her own selfishness that she does. I would rather read a different book about the civil war that contains better people than Scarlett. I feel sorry for the men that fall in love with Scarlett and I feel sorry for Scarlett because the one man she loves is lost to her. I do not believe in pining after something one cannot have, it wastes a lot of time and is too much wasted emotion. Even though I do not like Scarlett, I do appreciate the facts that Mitchell worked in about the civil war, such as the burning of Atlanta and what happened when the former slaves were given the right to vote and hold office. All in all, Gone With The Wind is an O.K. book, if you do not mind inconclusive endings and selfish people.",
            "The book was well written but personally I liked the movie better. Yes the book was about many things but the part that urked me was the romanticized view of the South's struggle with \"the low class treacherous Yankees\" and the so called uppity negroes. Oh how insolent and thirsty these \"brutes\" were for any thing white in a dress (southern propaganda of the reconstruction era and of Mitchell's own era.) Mitchell leaves out the fact that almost every Southern slave owner was himself only a gentleman during the day but at night was more treacherous to black womanhood than any \"darky\" ever was to that of white womanhood. Unfortunately many Americans know very little about history and therefore will sadly accept the lies and fantasies that Mitchell's book has exposed our society to. As I stated earlier, it was well written and I took great pains to read it in its entirety waiting for the point in which Mitchell's account of the South would be fair and balanced (since the movie wasn't so bad) but unfortunately it seemed Mitchell really believed that blacks who had been stolen from their homeland, whipped for not picking someone else's cotton fast enough, raped by their masters, abused by jealous mistresses were supposed to turn around after being freed and say \"thankee Massuh fo' all dat ya dun dun fo' me.\" Thank goodness for Alex Haley's Roots!",
            "oh god the ending! the ending! the ending!(it is best to read the book before you watch the movie)",
            "As angela camack pointed out, the film &quot;gone with the wind represents the institution of slavery as a walk in the park. The fact that the movie lasted over a period of years and it rarely showed a violent act towards a Black person is solid proof. The truth of the matter is that slavery in the deep south, likes places such as south carolina, was incredibly brutal and violated most human rights. The film attempted to depict slavery as a life where none of the slaves got beaten, whipped or raped, when in reality violent acts towards Black individuals was a common day occurrence. According to Frederick Douglass slaves were beaten weekly to strike fear into the other slaves. Women were raped continually over years of their lives in order to perpetuate the institution of slavery. Families were torn apart from each other due to the trading and selling of slaves. Gone With the Wind could have done a little more justice to Black Americans by not under emphasizing the torture and pain that they endured during the 19th century.Apart from its ignorant illusion of slavery the movie does illustrate, as Mark Burgh points out, the hardships of post Civil War life in the south. Scarlett O'Hara never had to do a thing for herself before the war. By the time Sherman was done marching to the sea she had made up her mind that she was going to conform to the new northern way of life in order to survive under the new politic. A lot of people in the south had to make that change, and I think that movie does an excellent job of showing the changes in life style before and after the war",
            "but it works, mainly because of Scarlett and Ashley, who are engaging if limited characters. Rhett Butler begins as interesting but is ultimately tiresome. Mammy is engaging, Prissy less so. The less said about Melanie and Ellen the better. Don't count on it as history lesson, either. Really, it's not much more than a well written bodice ripper (which explains why it has so many adolescent fans) but bodice rippers are often fun.",
            "Margaret Mitchel wrote only one book in her life. \"Gone With The Wind\" not only won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1935, but the film version won Best Picture in 1939 - opposite \"The Wizard of Oz\". Mitchel never wrote again, though in the mid 1940's she was struck by an automobile on Peachtree Street in Atlanta and her body was dragged for more than 100 feet.Her fiuneral was more majestic than Scarlet and Rhett's wedding.a signed first edition of this book today is worth well over $15,000.As for the new introduction written by Pulitzer Prize winner, Pat Conroy (\"The Prince of Tides\") He is, after all a Southern Writer and his own material is considered literature. I'll leave his words up to you. I respect his work a great deal. Even if not his opinion. And that's all an intorduction or a review is; a critic attempts to establish crredability with words. and in seeking out a Soutern Writer, though there are dozens of well qualified women writers (Lett's, Flagg, Kingsolver) With Styron, Clemens and Faulkner gone we are left with Conroy and John Grisham. I'd be interested to know what all of these people would write in an introduction.\"Gone With The Wind\" is a terrific story, fairly well written and highly emotional. It is one of the few war novels in history written from a woman;s perspective (that includes battle scene action) and the character of Scarlet O'Hara- our protaganist and ingenue - has become an adjective in describing other characters. In some ways, this novel; is a huge step forward for the feminist movement, but far more so it set the civil rights movement back subsgtantially and continues to every single time someone reads it. People read that book and actually believe that slaves were treated like family members. Mitchell writes about Mammy and Poke and Prissy passing along the perfumed hearsay her grandmother told her that the \"houise darkys\" are given \"family status\" but still Scarlett's frustration over Prissy's idlesness causes her to threaaten to break a switch acorss her back. Miss Scarlet runs into Big Sam as the Confederate Army leaves Atlanta to the Yankees while Scarlet must stay to bring Melly's baby (A love promise she made to Melly's husband)He is a Field Hand but she speaks with him because he is an overseer and only becausee the Yankee's canons and guns can be heard on the hprizon. She gaters information and does not wish him well;she will never see him again and as readers we never hear of him again. Neither the book nor the film do anything to expose what slavery was and the way in which \"Gone With The Wind\" has injured the rights for descendents of America-slaves is sinceely nauseating.There are millions who would break a switch across my back for this review. I saw go to it,k but you'd better re-read thge book before you do it. Perhaps watch the film as well, as it is less harsh than the book. (I own the screenplay)So by all means, everyone should read \"Gone With The Wind\". The more controlversial, the more one should read. But before you do, read Alice Walker's \"The Color Purple\" which also won the Pulitzer Prize. I've taught these books together as WAlker's also takes place in the South in 1935 and gives a clear idea of what life was like for the once-slaved,now impoverished. Thern read GWTW. After you get all teary and warm with \"Gone With The Wind\"(and you will be) then you must read William Styron's \"The Confessions of Nat Turner\", also a Pulitzer Prize winner, which was written in 1966, utilizerd what little is known of the trial of Nat Turner and tells us more truth about what it was to be a slave. If after that you still haven't gotten the picture pick up the recently published book about Paul Jennings, \"A Slave in The White House\"- the book that first speaks of a black man in the oval office, only he was dusting it, pouring drinks for President Madfison and he was, in truth, the one who rescued the lifesized portrait of George Washington. (Dolley Madison was a selfish, nasty woman who became frighened of her 104 slaves after President Madison died; oit is a fact, that during her lifetime at Montpieler after James died, Nat Turner's revolt occured and in New England the ship \"Amistad\" was overturned. For so many of us, fiction is a way to step into the minds and souls of another person in another world. With \"Gone With The Wind\" you run the risk of emerging a bigot.",
            "This is not a review or comment on Margaret Mitchell's work, but on the cheap, shoddy way that Scribner decided to package it. My daughter is in her third reading since we purchased this volume as a Christmas present in December, 06, and is the only one reading it in the house. Chunks of pages have begun falling out of the binding. The spine is paper, and not sturdy at that.I'm no expert on bookbinding, but this casts an image (for me, at least) of cheapness over the publisher. I'd like to have thought that for the price, this could have been expected to last a bit longer than 4 months.I guess this one's not going to be an heirloom. I've had many, many paperbacks that are in better condition after similar use.Sad, really, for such a wonderful work, to have been packaged this way.",
            "This is a great love story with more than a smidgen of insight into the human psyche, but it is also an offensive apologia for the American Original Sin--slavery. This is our Wagner. If you read it in public, don't forget the brown paper bag.",
            "I really liked this book. I'm a very very fast reader, and I read it in about one and a half hours. I really liked this book. It is a very nice story about the Civil War from a southerners point of view. You don't see very many books like that. I especially liked the part where they have to work in the fields. It shows that the Confederates didn't like the treatment of slaves, but they didn't care about the slaves. I kind of liked this book.",
            "As the title of the movie portrays it, &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; is the disappearance of a whole civilization after the Civil War, or a civilization gone with the wind. The movie is about the different stages at which the South was before, through, and finally during Reconstruction. At first, we observe how the Southern aristocracy lived during their peak years when the price of cotton was up in the skies. At the barbecue at Twelve Oaks, the Wilk's plantation, the movie depicts the arrogance of the southern gentlemen, since most of them wanted to go to war and blabbered expressions like, &quot;...a southern gentlemen is worth any ten yankees...&quot; They are all absolutely sure that they will win the war in a matter of months, but as it turned out they were absolutely incorrect. During this part of the movie, the views of the South that we observe are pretty biased, because slaves were treated as part of the family and with a lot of respect. In some plantations like the O'Hara's it could've happened, but it was very rare. Suddenly, when war is declared all of the southern beaux go to enlist into the army feverishly. The only one with a realistic view is Rhett Buttler, since he tells the men that before they start talking about victory they should be concerned in building more factories to supply their troops with such things as weapons and clothing. At this time, Rhett is looked at with scorn. But afterwards, he becomes a hero because he is the one who breaks the Union blockade and smuggles supplies into Charleston. When the war drags on, the south is just lingering its defeat. The movie also depicts the southern courage during the war, but with just courage and persistent one can't with the war. The movie is actually very realistic when it shows the wounded and the lack of supplies the southern hospitals had to help them. Finally when the war is about to end, we see General Sherman's troops marching into Atlanta and the evacuation of the city. In this scene, the movie also portrays Scarlett's courage by managing to take Melanie and the baby to Tara. When they finally arrive to Tara, we really see the devastation that took place at the South by the Union troops. At this moment, Scarlett vowed that no matter what she had to do, she would never suffer from hunger again in her life. Later, the carpetbaggers, or the blacks that come from the north, and the scalawags, southern people that supported reconstruction, make life very harsh for the southern people. They raise the taxes to the skies knowing that there is no way for them to be paid, but Scarlett with her strength and wit manages to pay them. Finally when she is established and married to Mr. Douglas, she starts a lumber business with Ashley Wilks. All her old friends criticize Scarlett, since she has become a scalawag herself and is dealing with the northern merchants. This part of the movie is very ironic because Ashley refuses to gain profit from forced labor, in this case prisoners that are brought to the mill by an overseer. Scarlett replies that he used to own slaves, but he tells her that even if the war didn't occur, they were going to be free when his father died. Again we observe the nostalgic and sympathetic view towards the South in the story line. Finally, the movie also presents the reactions that the Southerners had against the colored people. When Scarlett is attacked in the dark side of town, her husband and the other men pretend to be in a 'political meeting' while they are raiding into the blacks area burning their houses and killing some men. They wanted to 'clean' this area so it was safe for Scarlet to travel to the mill. Similar events did take place after the war. In fact, some of them took place in a larger scale and included lynchings and other violent acts. This anti-black feeling lead to the sprouting of groups like the Ku Klux Klan and the violence among both groups continued for a long time. Overall, &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; is a great movie that gives us a feeling of what it was like to live during the Civil War. Although it gets carried away sometimes by being slightly biased, the movie is a very good representation of the events that took place during this period. Besides from providing some historical evidence, it presents the different feelings and responses that the people had towards the confli",
            "This book is captivating from the start.The characters are so real.They aren't all good and Scarlett is a horrible person.That fact only makes you like her more.The ending of this book left me wanting more.That is why I can't wait to read the sequal.Gone With The Wind is a classic and anyone who hasn't read it is missing out.",
            "This book is my favorite. I have read it straight through a few numerous times, but my favorite thing to do is just pick it up and let the pages fall open. It's the kind of book you can do that with. I love the emotion the characters show, and especially what they hide, waiting for you to find out. The vitality of the Old South meeting with the views of one courageous woman and those both behing her and against her is amazing. Scarlett O'Hara , Rhett Butler, and the others are characters never to be forgotten, immortalized forever by Margaret Mitchell.",
            "GWTW has many flaws -- the political views of the book can be most kindly described as &quot;naive,&quot; and its racism is apparent on virtually every page. The second half of the book feels rushed; once Mitchell has actually united Scarlett and Rhett, she no longer seems to write them with the same imagination and humor. All that said, this is the quintessential blockbuster -- not a deep book by any means, but entertaining in ways most novels or movies could never dream of being. Mitchell has a gift of creating fantastical situations for her characters -- and making them seem not only believable but unevitable. The characterization is stronger than is generally realized; Scarlett, Rhett, and Ashley all have layers of complexity that far more &quot;literary&quot; novels often fail to create. It's part of pop culture, and American culture, and for all its flaws and frustrations, an endlessly enjoyable and memorable read.",
            "some people should just shut their mouths. Gone with the Wind was the best book ever written!!! I read it in a week when i was fifteen and fell in love. I had seen the movie seven times before i had read the book. After i read the book though, i became completely obsessed with Gone With the wind, i bought the book and the movie, and have been hunting for any pictures, quotes and reviews. Gone With the Wind- it's not only one of the best books i have ever read, it's an obsession, it's my life.By the way, to those who thought that Gone with the Wind was a ridiculous read because of the length, they can go and get a brain. Good books have a lot of depth to them, and they need all the extra pages they can get. Gone With the Wind is not all about trash, as an underimaginative few found it. It's not only an overdramatic love story, it's not only another one of those American civil war stories. It's really about the complexity of human emotions, feelings, and the way people handle obstacles and life,consequences of actions and emotions and also about certain people and their mutual understanding of each other. When i finished GWTW for the very first time, i continued to think about the extra depth in that book which i just couldn't understand. I read the book several times more, and also began reading in between the lines. In the end i discovered that Magaret Mitchell was an absolute genius. She was no where near the trashy romance writer many had portrayed her to be- she was a realist. She was actually writing about how human spirit and determination, how it can be applied to help one over such obstacles. For those who say there was no depth to gwtw ought to read the book again. Perhaps they read the book to fast for their own benefits, it's such a shame because it only denotes what shallow and uneducated people they are, not being able to understand truly what an amazing conquest Margaret Mitchell had achieved.",
            "If there is comfort food Gone with the Wind is comfort reading due to it's open and honest style. Great reading.",
            "The first time I read this book many years ago when I was still in high school and did not take the time to appreciate the book like I should have. Now that I have purchased this book and have re-read it I have fallen in love with the character of Scarlet. Although it is a long book, it is totally worth it.",
            "It is as powerfu ltoday as it was when it was written. The Old South is described with such detail, it takes your breath away",
            "I have loved this book since I first read it in high school and of course the movie too. Margaret Mitchell paints so vivid a picture of the South and their culture. The story between Scarlett and Rhett is timeless and classic. You will never find 2 people so made for each other. I love how in the end Scarlett and Rhett do not end up together and he ends up leaving her. I reread this book at least once a year and it I feel gets better and better every time I read it. This book has everything: action, romance and love and some of the best character development I have every read. I love this book.",
            "I have read this book many times over the years and decided having it on my Kindle would keep it available for reading anytime I wanted and now I may even read it more often.",
            "This is not the type of book I usually read. I am into Mary Higgans Clark and John Grisham. I only read this book because of school, and thought that I could sort of skim through it. Well after the first sentence I couldn't help but read every page word for word. This book is a page turner if I've ever seen one. You would think that the ending would be annoying, because it is so open, but I love it. I won't ever read the sequel because it could never even come close to the book. No matter hot good it is GWTW will be a thousand times better. I read this book in 10 days. That's like 100 pages a day, but I even forgot there were 1000 pages. You get so involved in the romance of Scarlett and Rhett that you could care less of the thickness of the book. I you haven't read this book, your are missing out on not only the greatest love story ever, but the greatest novel ever written. I picked up the book thinking that I had to read a book during the summer and that with all the talk about this one I might as well try it. I soon realized that ever positive review I have read about it can't come close to describing this book.",
            "This is my all time favorite book. I read it in the eigth grade and since them I have read it several times. I first started reading this book because of the movie, but after reading the first few hundred pages, I virtually forgot that there was a movie. The 1939 movie with Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable is spectacular but Mitchell's book surpasses that greatness. This is the novel that proves the saying that the book is always better than the movie.I have read all the reviews that people have published on this site and it amazes me that anyone gave GTWT less than five stars. I couldn't put this book down!Gone With the Wind is romance to the highest degree and it only improves each time I read it. Scarlet's encounters with Rhett are my favorite part of this book. Everytime they meet it draws me in. The thing that makes this book great however, is that it isn't just about romance, it is about survival and although Scarlet isn't the nicest person like Melanie, it is hard to not root for her. She does everything all the way and never holds back what she is feeling.",
            "I read this book for the first time when I was 14 and I havebeen in love with it ever since. Scarlett was desperate for love, butwas looking in all the wrong places. She loved Rhett, but was too determined to make it in the world without him in an era that frowned on women behaving in that manner. In the end, she only defeated her own purpose; she had plenty of money, but no love. The characters in this book were written with such vivid color that they will live forever, whether in print or on screen.",
            "I read the book before seeing the movie, and the movie makes the book look horrible! I have read GWTW at least ten times and it gets better everytime I read it. I can picture the scences as I read the book. This is the ultimate love story about a woman looking for love and security when it's right in her face. I always cry at the end but I know Scarlett will get Rhett back, she'll just put it out of her mind and think of it tomorrow.",
            "This is the best book ever written. I first read it the summer before eighth grade, and then again around February of that year. There is so much drama. I read the book before seeing the movie, but I don't think it matters what order you do them in, as long as you do both. Everyone should read and watch Gone With the Wind sometime in their life. My favorite character is Scarlett, because she changes and learns so much throughout the book. She learns that she really didn't love Ashley, and she really loved Rhett, although she realized that too late. Scarlett realized how selfish she was to marry two men she didn't love. She married Charles when he was really India's beau, and regretted it when Charles died, like what happened when she stole Frank, her sister's beau. I know I gave this book five stars, but it deserves so much more. Gone With the Wind is a must read for anyone!",
            "I had fought against reading the book for many years. Having seen the movie many times, I thought &quot;Why should I wade through a thousand pages?&quot; Well, something drove me to start the book and I surprised myself by not being able to put it down. I recall actually rushing home from work, barely eating and reading late in the night. The story line is good, and the characters believable. It also provides come insight into a phase of American history, something we all could use. Don't delay - read it soon. I doubt if you'll regret it.",
            "I am 17 and just finish reading Gone with the Wind and thesequal. I loved all the charaters except Ashley. I believe everyemotion that the characters felt and I even know people who are as selfish as Scarlett. The author did a great job in describing everything but I did not enjoy the racism. But one must understand that she grew up in the early 1900s and in the south. She must have heard stories of the war because the rage and anger was still fresh in their minds. It cannot be expected that the book will not be racist when the author grew up with it. It must be overlooked in order to enjoy the great story. In the days that I read it I did not eat, sleep, talk to anybody, or even watch t.v. because it swept me into the world of the American Civil War. The 1000 and plus pages go by in a flash and you wish there were more. I suggest to everybody not to read the sequal because it ruins the characters and is completly unbelieveable and foolish. I loved Rhett, Scarett, and Melly because they have true human emotions. I recommand to watch the movie first so you won't be disappointed. You'll enjoy the handsome Clark Gable, the beautiful Vivien Leigh, and the charming Olivia de Havilland. Great novel!!!",
            "Gone With the Wind, the timeless tale of the old south, depicts colourful characters as they strugggle with the hardships of love, life and the Civil War. Scarlett O'Hara, a tragic hero, matures of her love of Ashley Wilkes, by means of her life experiences, which wisen Scarlett of her downfalls and also her attributes. The fact that the situation thrust upon her wisens her, she is forced to mature herself, and this included her selfish ways. Gone with the Wind is a classic, a must for all who study, or who are remotly interested in the modern history of America.",
            "Well, for starters, I read the book before ever seeing the movie. Margaret Mitchell did a great job on her first novel. I read Scarlett (gets a bit nasty in places, and totally unbelievable), but GWTW is THE book to read. My copy is 1,024 pages long. Don't freak. Amazingly enough, even people who don't like long books ought to like it. Now for the opinions. I hated Ashley, in the book and the movie. I didn't like Melanie very much (&quot;Oh, Melly, don't be a goose.&quot;) 'cause she was so lovable. She was basically perfect. Rhett was a total jerk at times. You probably figured out by now that I side with Scarlett. She was tough, yet tender at times. I think that this book should occupy a place on your shelf or in your hand.",
            "I'm 14. I read this book last winter and still quote words and actually use things the characters learned in this saga to improve my own life. Its almost like self-help but in such an entertaining way. The way the book is written, it is almost as if you are afraid to put the book down because the characters (especially Scarlett, she is quite busy) may do something without you. It is truely the best book I have ever read, and I don't even like historical fiction! i recommend this to anyone who can read. Enjoy!",
            "I read it when I was 11 and I could hardly put it down, it took me 5 days to read this amazing book. Sure there is a dead spot in the middle and it gets a little depressing, but it is worth the read. I recommend this book to anyone who likes civil war romance.",
            "I read Gone with the Wind last summer and could not put it down...and then I read it again. I've read many great books in the classic genre, but none have been able to captivate me as Gone with the Wind has. Mitchell paints her characters so vivdly that as you read about their hardships during the Civil War and Reconstruction you just want to cry. Gone with the Wind is truly one of the best books ever written.",
            "For all of you that have read GWTW you must know why this is my favorite book ever! I am 15 and I read this book around a month ago after a friend of mine told me I just had to read it and I could not put it down. My Mom encouraged me too as she loved it also. Now I know what everyone is raving about. This saga simply swept me off my feet! This isn't just a novel for young girls...it's for everyone and you just have to read it. I was captivated by Mitchell's breathtaking descriptions of the south and how can any female just not fall in love with Rhett? It's almost impossible to describe to you all the aspects of this novel! I went through this book so fast...at times I laughed but there were also times when you ge so annoyed, frusturated and angry at Scarlett's antics (forget about Ashley already!) but you cannot help loving her for who she is too. Though GWTW may not be 100% historically accurate...who really cares!? Also, I just saw the movie...don't miss it!! That was just wonderful as well. (it was also voted the #2 Romance movie of all time by the Amerian Film Institute recently!) As for the sequel, Scarlett, I was a little dissapointed but I had to have closure and have the comfort of knowing Rhett took Scarlett back. All in all, read Gone With the Wind! This monumental epic has all the aspects of a book anyone could ever look for.",
            "You can tell by every other review of this book and probably by the advice of people you know that &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; is an enduring classic. I LOVE THIS BOOK! But, be warned that this paperback edition has several spelling and gramatical errors. I was quite disapointed by the editing done here.",
            "Gone With The Wind is one of the most powerful works of literature I've ever read- its fluildy eloquent style and intricatly crafted descriptions make it seem more like a scene being played out, rather than words on page. I couldn't put it down- there are so many twists, and nothing turns out the way you hope it would. This is the best book I've ever read, and I recommend it to everyone.",
            "Gone With the Wind is a great book that gives lots of descriptive detail, it as if you are there in the story. The book puts the movie to shame. I read the book before seeing the movie and I am glad I did. With as much detail that is in the book it is hard to make any kind of movie from it. The book story line is set during the Civil War. Placing the story during the Civil War makes the action and adventure seeker want to read the book. Although the book takes about war a lot there are several love triangles in the book. Having these love triangles in the story keeps the tension in the story and makes the read wonder who will be with who next. Having the story take place during this time brings a sense of realism to the book and makes the reader feel for the characters during this time. The book is also set in the point of view of the south. Having the book take place in the south is different and makes the reader realize why the war was being fought. This is a very fun book to read and I would recommend it anyone.",
            "Gone With The Wind is the best book I have ever read. I like it because of the setting{I like the old time books}and the characters. I also like it because it is very long and keeps my interest, which is very hard to do. So I think it is a good book to read.",
            "This is an great book. The character interaction, the historical sweep, everything. If you love, or even like, the movie, you should definitely read this book. There are so many things, even characters, in the book that were left out of the movie, the book fleshes everything out. I absolutely recommend this book!",
            "As an avid reader, I read this book, all 1037 pages, within about a week. I just couldn't put it down. Margaret Mitchell has skillfully woven life's everyday struggles in with the struggles only faced during Reconstruction. Although I do not beleive in Scarlett's thoughts about the war and Yankees and so on, it was almost hard not to empathyize with her and her struggles. Although all in all a nasty person, sometimes you can't help but love her.The strength of character portrayed by Melanie Wilkes has decided for me what I will name my first little girl. Melanie.As for Rhett, I do believe he is my favorite of them all.",
            "This book was an amazing view of the Civil War era as well as a beautiful love story. It is a testament to the strain the war caused on every person in the country at the time. Aside from the war it let's you in to the parts of your soul that too many try to hide. Some people think Scarlett was a demon, but I think she was and is a part of every person. Everyone should read GWTW. If you don't your really missing out. It is by far the best I've ever read and I'm convinced I'll never find better.",
            "I bought this vintage copy of \"Gone With the Wind\" for my friend's birthday. She has always loved this story and I wanted to get her as close to an original copy of the book as I could. She loved the book, its history, and of course this classic story.",
            "I love the movie, but the book is so much better. Beautiful edition, even the print is stylish. Reading it was pure pleasure - it took me over a year, as I was sparing the book. My wholehearted recommendation to anyone who loved the movie.",
            "I, TOO, am a literary snob. But I have to say, I had to go back again and read this much-loved book of my younger years -- well, only 5 years ago. But I relayed this heart-felt literary love of mine to my other great hardcover friends, Tawney and Marie (one, a long-time member of the illustrious Corduroy Club/Manhattan chapter), and they immediately nodded and tilted their heads at my cerebral connection to this masterpiece. I hope that we all, including myself (after countless other reads, good and bad, achievements and not so much of sad, downwardly-glanced works, but I digress) revisit this delightful glance at a telling of history that few these days pause to the written word. I commend my fellow apprecianados. Life - let it be lived.",
            "Gone With the Wind is an amazing novel, I would recommend it to anyone. I read it when i was 14 and it was a considerably easy read, everyone should read it. It is AMAZING!!!",
            "I know some people are a little bit aprehensive when they are thinking about reading a classic, and rightly so, but although it is long and wordy (some parts can be very confusing and maybe read over a few times) it is one of the greatest romance stories ever written. I loved this book so much and have read it over and over again, and each time I discover little things that I've missed before. Definitely worth the amount of time it takes to read, also, try reading the sequel, Scarlett. I can't remember the author, but the style of Margaret Mitchell was immitated very well.",
            "Gone With the Wind is one of the most wonderful books I have ever read. It's a beautiful story of the civil war told from a southern belle's point of view. I had serious migranes reading it, since the print is so tiny but it was well worth it! I first read this at 13 and I would reccomend it to anybody!",
            "I loved this book. It gave a very interesting viewpoint of the south during the civil war. Everyone should read it instead of watching the movie!",
            "Okay, I saw the movie and it was awesome. But it's nothing compared to this fast paced, brilliantly written book. I've read it twice in the past three months and each time it's been amazing. I would deffinatly reccomend this to absolutely everyone.",
            "Reading I have started since kindergraten, and never have I read better. Gond with the Wind is a book of history and it is timless.",
            "The title says it all. Poor Scarlett. In her life, everything is just Gone with the Wind. Rhett. Her lifestyle. Melanie. The Confederacy. Her mother, Ellen. Her father, Gerald. Her first husband, Charles. Her second husband, Frank. Bonnie. The Tarleton twins. Cade. But through it all, she goes on. My favorite character was Melanie Hamilton Wilkes. She was so nice, loyal, trustworthy, loving, brave, courageous, funny, charming, polite, and Oh! so much more...My least favorite character was Rhett. \"That nasty varmint!\" as Scarlett said. I hated how Scarlett was so mean to Melanie, until it was too late. But no matter what scarlett did or said that was wrong, Melanie still loved her and stuck by her until the end, and even past then! I am also delighted that this story is told by the Confederate point if view. Atta girl, Mithcell!! A must for all Confederates, adults, children, everyone should read it!!!!!!!!",
            "This book is wonderful! It is the best classic ever written! Scarlett, a young lady growing up during the Civil War, struggles through many things. The hardships she faces are unbeleiveable! She has three husbands- Hamilton, Kennedy, and Butler. SHe ends up divorcing them all. There are many sad events in the bood, but there are also some happy moments. This book is a must read!",
            "I HAVE READ GONE WITH THE WIND MANT TIMES AND EVERY TIME I CRIED AT THE END. IT DESERVES READING.",
            "GWTW is passion, betrayals, and the flirtations of southern breezes on sultry nights. Mitchell gets into the characters' heads better than most authors dare dream to do.",
            "The most fantastic lovestory ever written and possibly the best book. This is my favourite book certainly and the sequel isn't a patch on it. Definitely should be recommended for everyone!",
            "GWTW IS MY FAVORITE BOOK! THE BOOK WAS WELL-WRITTEN AND THE CHARACTERS WERE THE BEST. THIS PULLED ME IN AS SOON AS I BEGAN READING IT AND I RECOMMEND IT FOR ANYONE WHO LIKES THE BEST OF BOOKS. IT IS A TRUE CLASSIC AND TRULY SHOWS HOW THE SOUTH SUFFERED IN THE CIVIL WAR AND THE REBUILDING OF THE SOUTH. I LOVED GONE WITH THE WIND.",
            "I think this is the best book I've ever read! You should really read this book. I love it! and I'll read it again!",
            "This book is about a love story which takes place in the Civil War period and it gives you a magnificent disription of what the south went through during the American Civil War. (The movie is just as good , in my oppnion)",
            "&quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is certainly the most wonderful book I have ever read. Never has a book made me acutally feel as if I was there watching it happen. I recommend this book to ANYONE, and EVERYONE!!",
            "I'm in the third grade and this was a really good book",
            "I have read this book at least 10 times. I am never bored or figedty when I'm reading GWTW. I love the movie too. I have made my family watch it so many times that my 18year old daughter is now a GWTW fan, too!",
            "I received the book on time but the back cover was torn at the binding 1/2 way down! I was not impressed with that at all.",
            "I'M FINDING IT VERY HARD TO KEEP READING THE BOOK. I EXPECTED IT TO BE EVEN BETTER THAN THE MOVIE; BUT SO FAR, I'M STRUGGLING TO KEEP READING",
            "I am just really getting started reading Gone With The Wind, so don't feel I have a real handle on the story as of yet. It is good enough to keep me reading and not lose interest.",
            "It was GREAT!!!! I loved the book and couldn't put it down! I read the whole thing in four days (:",
            "This book will make a beautiful gift! It is still nice to have a book in your hands and it'll be very inviting sitting on the shelf",
            "There are a few main factors that fed into how I reviewed the book:1. Scarlett is annoying, not that bright, pretty cruel, and not my idea of a great lady. She doesn't really change for the better and her violent reactions become predictable.2. The story is woven very nicely, though it is extremely verbose at times.3. Mitchell created vivid, interesting characters who were fun to observe (with the exception of Scarlett, at times).4. People rant and rave over it being a racist novel, which is, in a sense, true. It is a book written about a racist group of people during a racist period of history in an area that was known to be very racist at the time. It was interesting to see how unapologetically racist people could be, according to Mitchell's storytelling at least. The book, though, is not racist in the sense that it supports racism and bigotry. In fact, I walked away from this book with a heightened interest in learning more about what freed slaves endured during the years following the war. For me, the mark of a good book is whether it encourages further study and intellectual curiosity, which Gone With the WInd can do.",
            "I purchased this book for a gift. The cover and the text were good, but the side of the book had a huge black marker line right down the bottom. I don't mind so much for myself, but I do not feel good about giving a gift that is marred. I was very unhappy.",
            "Using a kindle to read \"Gone with the Wind\" has been a real pleasure for my husband.He rarely reads books, prefers magazines, but the kindle is really working for him.As for the book, well its GWTW!!! As a southern gal married to a midwesterner its been hardgiving him a picture of how the Civil War affected us, and this has opened his eyes to the emotionalside of the happening.Good job KINDLE!!!!",
            "i got this for my grama for an xmas gift and she loved it and itgot to me in time and looked great.",
            "and the 1000p+ pages just flew by effortlessly...like listening to good music, reading he prose requires no effort.My only gripe is that the principle protagonists, Scarlet and Rhett, are not very likeable...to put it mildly.Scarlet is a flat out sociopath, and Rhett is little more than a common criminal.I had hoped that over 1000+ pages they might grow and develop...but despite lots of travails and trials, they do not...which was rather disappointing.",
            "I loved this book! Scarlet is an authentic heroine- complicated and believable. I will remember more of the story of the Civil War from her story than I ever would from reading a history book. I lived in Georgia for about 4 years and the sense of state-pride was always sort of a mystery to me. Reading Gone with the Wind helped me to better understand the story of the civil war from the southern perspective and better understand the chivalrous culture still present today.",
            "I never tire of reading Gone with the Wind. I just preferred to read the hard back this time.",
            "It is hard to imagine anyone having the nerve to tackle a review of this book, as it is a classic and has already survived any review ever given to it. Suffice it to say that I read it the first time at 16, and it has remained my favorite book ever since. Written by a southerner who grew up on the stories, this novel will entertain and educate you about the Civil War, life on a plantation, and the courage to survive against all odds.",
            "It is a wonderful story...I love the different perspective of the civil war.It is also funny, witty, and well-written. One of the best love stories of all time.I was sorry to see it end, and although I haven't read the sequel, I am sure it can not do Margaret Mitchell's work justice. The only person who I think could write an adequate sequel is Margaret Mitchell herself.Gone With the Wind is definitely a five star novel.",
            "I purchased this copy of Gone with the Wind because I particularly liked the blue cover. The package arrived safely and in a timely manner. I was pleased with the transaction.",
            "I personally very much enjoyed \"Gone With the Wind\". It was filled with romance as well as peril and unpredictability. I recomend this book for young adults and adults because it is not a kid theme.",
            "I read this book once. Once was enough, but twice would be better. I'm an avid reader, and writer. This book captured every emotion that literary devices are suppose to capture. I found myself crying, laughing, scared, shocked. I've been searching for a book that competes with Gone With the Wind and haven't found one. You know the main characters like they are in your life, and you're taken back to the Civil War. Nothing is downcasted, everything is how it was in the eighteen sixies. Scarlett O'Hara was such a wonderful character, she lives in everyone hearts long after the last page is turned. Even though the book is lengthy, it keeps your attention, truely, until the last page and would keep it further if it were longer. The book was amazing, a true American Literature Classic. I highly recommend this book. You won't be able to find another like it. Gone With the Wind is a true, diamon in the rough.",
            "and hope she loves as much as I do.I have read this story several times- so many that I have it commited to memory!I always had a copy of it with me until my last one feel apart from reading it to many times.!Scarlett is a strong woman, and in that time that strength was frowned upon by both men and women. I have - many times, drawn on the strength that she had through out the story.I hope that my daughter reads this when she is a teen and sees Scarlett for the modern woman that she is.",
            "Gone With the Wind is a beatifully written book that intrigued me from the very beginning! I had to read this book for an English class. My mom suggested it to me and I decided to make her happy I would start it, but I knew I'd never finish it- I mean 1,000 pages???? But, the first time I picked it up I read until page 70 and I would have kept reading, but it was late! It made me laugh, cry, and everything in between. I love how the book ends how it ends.(I can't tell you how!)I did read the sequel, and I have to say, it was OK, but not nearly as well written as Gone With the Wind. I would recommend this book to anyone who is in need of a good novel. Don't let the 1,000 pages intimidate you because when you read it, you'll forget there are that many pages, honest!!!!!",
            "Margaret Mitchell captures the essence of the Old South and skillfully interweaves that history with the travail of the civil war. She illustrates the high purposes for which the South fought the war and also demonstrates the utter futility of the Southern position and the senseless nature of most conflicts.",
            "This a fabulous book. I think it is much better than the movie. A must for anyone, who loves to read. It is prefect for history fans. I have read and re-read this book many times. It is one of my favorites. It is set in the Civil War era. It is about Scalett O'Hara and Rhett Bulter. It was later made into a movie, starring Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable. Scallet is very independent women, who is famous for her green eyes, and her red hair, that explains her fiery temper. who first gets married to Charles Hamiltion. He's sister is Melanie, who becomes the wife of Ashley, the man, Scarlett wants but can never have. She has a a son, Wade, with Charles. Then she keeps her family together,--anyway she can. She even kills a Yankee. Then she marrys Frank Kenndy, to pay the taxes on Tara. She has a daughter, Ella, with him. He dies while having to Klu Klux Klan. She marrys Rhett. The have a fiery romance. They have a daughter, that Rhett names Bonnie Blue Butler, because her eyes were as blue as the Bonnie Blue Flag. This book closes with Scarlett pronouncing the famous words, \"After all, tomorrow is another day!\"",
            "I loved this book. Very dramatic, great story. However, not having ever seen the movie or read the book, I was expecting a love story. Isn't it called the best love story of our time? They never fell in love! However disappointed, the book was great, well written, a great story. . . not a love story.",
            "My paper back is barely going to withstand another reading since I have nearly worn it out. I actually read the book before seeing the movie. I was very disappointed! The movie made Scarlett seem so evil, but in the book she depicted more as a strong woman who did what she had to do to survive. The only thing that would be better than reading this book again, would be to have the audio version so I could listen to it in the car.",
            "I think that Gone with the wind is the best book ever written the movie is a winner to . I love how it informs you of everything that is going on. You go through the whole book like will Scarlett and Redett get together or will they stay together will Scarlett finally get Ashely. Will they survive the war. Who will live and who will die. You read through the tragides and the good times . I give Gone with the Wind and will argue with anyone who differs.",
            "this novel is coming from others generations for me, at first my mother read it and loved it so now i became interested in reading to, i hope it`s cool because i will spend a long time reading and end up bored will be terible.",
            "This edition is literally missing the part where Bonnie dies! There are no pages missing, just the material. Horrific. I threw it out.",
            "First, let me say that Gone With the Wind is possibly the best and most satisfyingly well-written novel I have ever read. To quote Alice Randall, the author of another favorite of mine, The Wind Done Gone, &quot;Above all, Gone With the Wind made me think.&quot;Anyone who gives this book less than three stars invariably does so because of the rampant racism throughout the novel. One cannot say in defense that it was simply the views of the people at the time, because Magaret Mitchell, the author, was not just being historically accurate; she was racist herself.The horror! A racist novel by a racist author! And what's worse, it's one of the best loved novels in America.Parts of this book did make me cringe and leave me angry, namely the roles of Prissy and Big Sam. Yes, those parts were atrocious. But here's a thought:Pretend for a minute that you were born in the early 1900's, in the deep South, with Confederate veterans and aging Southern belles for family. Now tell me you wouldn't be racist. Of course, any middle class enlightened white person would say they'd know better, but would you? I greatly doubt it. Gone With the Wind is fiction, not fact, from the mind of a woman who embodied what her family taught her, no more. Take it and move on. Sure, it's offensive, but it's also wonderful. There are too many layers to this novel for the complexity of it to be fully appreciated in my review, but if you're can't get past the racism to appreciate this book, then I have to wonder what else you're missing in life.What I did when I finished Gone With the Wind was go out and buy Alice Randall's book The Wind Done Gone. It's very thought provoking, and it will mollify a bit of your anger dealing with the bad treatment of blacks in this book. Also, I reccomend The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison, because it deals with the internalized racism that slaves felt in the pre-war South. Beloved is another great one that will show you what the slaves REALLY went through. But don't miss out on Gone With the Wind. Read it, love it, and let it show you the past.",
            "I haven't really heard anything about this book nor have I seen the movie, so I didn't know what to expect when I started reading. I suppose I could use my desire to to broaden my reading scope as a reason for picking up this novel. I haven't read enough of the classics, the heavy stuff, the stuff that should have a good reason for staying around this long.Anyway, this book was teeming with racist undertones, and it annoyed me, to say the least. I could never really get comfortable with the writing, however beautiful and applause-worthy it was, because in would come the worthless diatribes about the slaves and how dumb and shiftless and worthless they were. It's not that the book was written about times of slavery and the aftermath of the American Civil War; I understand that people in those times had their reasons and their own beliefs. (I read Queen by Alex Haley with no problem, although I will concede that Queen was written by descendant of slaves and the view would be slightly different.) But I wonder if the woman who wrote Gone With the Wind was racist--or at the very least more than mildly prejudiced--because she wrote unnecessary addendums when describing the 'darkies,' superfluous ramblings that seemed to be more her own thoughts than the thoughts of the book's characters. She wrote things like, [the slave girl] couldn't comprehend...in her little black skull, and the use of the 'n' word when something else would have sufficed. The way she described Big Sam's excitement in seeing his mistress again after the war almost made my blood run cold. I ran into a lot about how the 'good' slaves all hated the idea of being free and the 'no good free issue' slaves were the ones who, apparently, realized that they were getting a raw deal when it came to that 'peculiar institution.' Really, wanting to be equal to whites [in every way that counted] was such a preposterous idea! I get the feeling I'm overreacting, but that's what happens when you read material like that in times such as these.Another thing that bothered me about it is that this is supposed to be the greatest love story of all time and almost eight hundred pages into the thing, Rhett and Scarlett still weren't together. He loved her--he admitted this to her at least thrice--and she didn't realize that she even really liked him, let alone loved him, until she halfway got over her Ashley Wilkes obsession.My third problem with the book came in the form of one young Miss O'Hara. As much as I tried to remain sympathetic and understanding to Scarlett's plight and her reasonings, her behavior made it easy for me to remain unmoved while reading. While I applauded her moments of unselfishness (very few and far between), Katie Scarlett O'Hara Hamilton Kennedy Butler was a nuisance and she was one of the main reasons I walked away from this book without too much feeling. However, I did love the way Rhett was written, for reasons I cannot properly articulate because even I do not know why I liked him so much. I guess I believe he and Melanie Hamilton Wilkes were the only truly likeable people in this book.The language was beautiful, the scenes vivid, breathtaking and all of that which is desirable when talking books. Ms. Mitchell wrote a really good book but sadly, it's not for everyone to enjoy.",
            "A real classic that I read first in 1963, and have read many times since. Just buying a copy for Kindle.",
            "Margaret Mitchell's Scarlett was a strong woman who could just as easily lived in the 1960s as she did the 1860s. What a strong, admirable role model she must have been for girls when this book first came out in the thirties. All those pages and yet, I couldn't put the thing down.",
            "Almost everyone had heard of the beautiful Scarlett O'Hara and the way she can make men weep. The book, Gone with the Wind, though enthralling through 1,022 of it's pages, with it's can't-put-this-book-down events, unexpected turns, tragedies and historical content, has an, in my opinion, very unsatisfactory ending. According to some, it's &quot;The greatest love story of our time. Maybe it is, but the conclusion to the love triangle of Rhett, Ashley and Scarlett was left off as if it were not the end, but the beginning. I suppose it could be argued that you should use your imagination, and that the author wanted to escape those cliche of the studly man living happily ever after with the beautiful damsel but the last two pages left me wanting more. However, if you're the type of person who can deal with not-really-the-end endings, I would really recommend this book. Although it has maybe, an overabundance of pages, Scarlett's life takes many unexpected turns and you sometimes you get so enraptured in the excitement and tragedy that you find that you've read several pages and not even realized it. This book is also full of historical information about the civil war, looking at it from the very different perspective of the women of the south. Margate Mitchell has a way of writing that always keeps you guessing and feed you words of wisdom to live by. Almost like one really long tragic soap opera.",
            "Of course I love GWTW. I have read it at least a hundred times and it never fails to capture me. However, I want to make it clear to those who have children who wish to read GWTW, or if you are a young person yourself, that this is a novel which glorifies the ideals of the 'old south'. And that 'old south' so dearly loved and cherished by the characters of the book is one built with the sweat and blood of thousands of African Americans, and not those who reaped the benefits of slavery. By all means, enjoy this book for its romanticism. However, I think it is imperative that such misguided idealism and blatent cruelty must be treated as such and explained to those who are still rather impressionable.",
            "Gone with the Wind changed my point of veiw on the Civil War and how hard women worked and tried to be ladies. Scarlett worked hard to prevent Tara from being taken away and preventing hunger of her family. My point on the Civil War was southerners were terrible people but GWTW changed changed all that, most people treated their &quot;workers&quot; or slaves as part of the family and were happy. It was the yankee's who were terrible the wouldn't let the south be they had to torture them. The story is very good and if you haaven't read it YOU MUST READ IT.",
            "This book is a definite YES! It's exciting and it keeps you on the egde of your seat. It's so hard to put down! Scarlett and Rhett are such believeable characters and this is definitely the BEST book ever written. I strongly suggest you purchase it or check it out. This is a super book. It gives an exellent portrayal of the south before and after the war. It gives you the south's point of view. I would give it 10000000000000000000 stars!",
            "I absolutly loved GWTW! I loved the way Rhett acted towards Scarlett. In the beginning the way Mrs. Mitchell describes Scarlett is very good and gives you a good idea of the way Scarlett is. Rhett was my favorite character because he was so dashing and handsome. He also was kind and sweet you just couldn't tell most of the time, He was so funny when he was with Scarlett and how he hid his love for her made me sad. Scarlett was really a mean person most of the time, she was selfish and creul to the people around her. It made me mad the way she thought about Melanie, and how she used men to get money or revenge. Ashley was one of my least favorite characters, he was so unrealistic! The Tarleton twins were some of my favorites, they were vivacious and funny and sweet to Scarlett in the time you read about them. I just don't understand how Scarlett could just give up everything she had grown up in to be rich. Its just not right. I loved the part of the story during Rhett's and Scarlett's honeymoon! They were so happy! Bonnie was so like Scarlett it was unbelievable. You could understand why all the people and Rhett and even Scarlett loved her so! But how could she just send Wade and Ella away to Tara that way without any feeling about it. You could totally relate to the characters in the story, it on numerous times made me laugh, cry, mad, and jump for joy! I loved it!",
            "The minute I began this book, it was my all-time favorite. I had just turned eleven when I read it, and a lot of people thought it would be way over my head, but it wasn't. I read it in five days, that's about 205 pages a day. The instant I began reading it, Margaret Mitchell was my favorite author and GWTW was my favorite book. It is totally unsurpassed. It is and will remain a classic forever. Scarlett &amp; Rhett were very realistic, as were the other characters. I've read it several times. Every time I read it, I cry at the end, and at other various places in the book. There are no words that could ever possibly describe how spectacular, wonderful, magnificent, this book is. It is totallu unforgettable. If you read this book and didn't like it, there's something the matter with you, because it's totally lovable. It's impossible not to like it. I couldn't put it down the entire time I was reading. I took it everywhere with me. When I was done, I searched everywhere for the sequel, SCARLETT. I had to wait almost a week before it came in and I was dying to know what happened the entire time. I couldn't sleep some nights, for worrying about how things would turn out. I've been trying to get all my friends to read this great book. Some of them are actually thinking about it. There is just nothing else to say about a book as great as this one.",
            "Perhaps it was Scarlett's unbreakable spirit as she tries to overcome her physical and mental struggles. Maybe it is the unreadabe and constantly fickle Rhett Butler. Or possibly it is the way the author describes the characters, the settings, and the events of this gripping novel in her own unique way. I really cannot specifically pinpoint why &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is my favorite book. All I know is that somehow it captivated me, and even now, a year after I first read it, I am still constantly thinking about it. The hard simplicity and honesty of the novel make it easy to love, and I imagine I will always cherish it.",
            "a long time ago, i had heard about gone with the wind, a lot of my friends parents would tell me about it, and i never, ever, thought that i would actually enjoy reading this 1000 paged book. i was very much mistaken. margaret mitchell really could write a story. at work one day, there was an old copy on our shelf, i decided to pick it up and just for the heck of it, give it a chance. well, lets just say, i could not put it down. it was by far the most captivating, best story ever written. after you are done reading it, it remains in your heart forever. scarlett is our present day ally mcbeal, looking for love in all the wrong places, confused, not having a clue what she really wants out of a relationship. rhett, he is the most sexiest character ever written, no present day harlequin romance even comes close. but if you want to know more, you must read the book, believe me you will not be disappointed.",
            "I noticed some other people who wrote reviews complaining about how racist the book is. I hope it will help show how it happened that there was a terribly bloody war fought and that slaveholders were less monstrous than I used to think. I loved the book. The sequel was less good, but everyone should still read it",
            "There are many reviews for the edition of this classic novel stating that page 713 is missing and in it's place is 813.I ordered this edition because I loved the cover. That may sound materialistic, but I really didn't care that one page was wronged, as I am used to reading books that have pages missing (Our library is in need lol)I recieved my copy yesterday, and immediately turned to see this notorius mistake. I am happy to report that the problem has been fixed, and that page 713 is now there!THis is a wonderful edition. The cover is beautiful, the pages neatly layed out, and a quite enjoyable book at that.Wonderful wonderful wonderful. Strongly recommend it!!",
            "&quot;GWTW&quot; is one of my favourite comfort books; &quot;War and Peace&quot; is another. They are similar in that they are sagas involving families whose lives are changed by war and how characters are affected by war. Some people fall to pieces and cannot contemplate a 'new' life where they have no place( Countess Rostova and Ashley Wilkes); while others find a hitherto unknown inner strength (Natalia Rostov and Scarlett). Margaret Mitchell took 10 years to write &quot;GWTW&quot;, thus starting the book in the '20's. She drew upon the stories that she had heard as a child from Civil War veterans and her own mother . Scarlett is the heroine of the book and there are very few scenes (as in the film) where she does not appear. &quot;War and Peace&quot; was also written over a long period of time. Tolstoy's work focuses on an exhaustive cast of characters, and places the reader in scenes domestic (&quot;peace&quot;) and foreign -the battlefields (&quot;war&quot;). Mitchell keeps her reader confined to Scarlett's side with third person references to battles and other factors of war. One could write a thesis ( as I felt I was beginning to!) on this topic. Let's just say that both are wonderful books; &quot;War and Peace&quot; is considered a &quot;Classic&quot;, while &quot;GWTW&quot; a classic example of historical fiction!",
            "Gone With The Wind is a superb book. It's story is so intresting. Margaret Mitchell wrote a wonderful book. I believe Gone With The Wind is my favorite book of all time and I can not wait to read it again. I love the way Mitchell describes Scarlett, Melanie, Rhett and Ashley. This is a literary gold!",
            "i just finished Gone With the Wind, and i love it. although it is heart-breaking, it's romantic and full of emotions. i like how the characters were develped; they all have their own traits. anyone who likes romance or has a lot of patience, i suggest you to read this book. (remember, you might cry like a baby when you finsih the book cuz it's........read it, and you'll know what i mean.)",
            "This book moved me because it was full of spontaneous adventure and valuable lessons. Margrett Mitchell not only wrote on romance and love, but also on the very real issues of a woman's place, jealousy, loyalty, and respect. Scarlett is the ideal stong and independent woman. She did not need men for their money and protection; she needed them for more suitable reasons like love and comfort. The entire novel was a lovely and inspiring story with twists of all kinds. I would highly recommend it to anyone in need of a wonderful read.",
            "Having lost count of how many times I have read Gone With the Wind, I continue to come back to it as, by far, my favorite book. Margaret Mitchell creates characters so vividly they seem real and sets them in a period of American history, the Civil War, that many of us are familiar with but from a perspective few can relate to, namely that of the Southern plantation family. It's very easy to create a vivid image of the characters, the context, the time in history, and how these factors mesh together to create situations that Scarlett O'hara can stuggle through and flourish in. Mitchell's creation of such characters as Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler allow you to question what exactly right and wrong really mean. These characters are selfish and crude, and reak of something, but throughout the book they continuously do extraordinary things for others. If you are in anyway a fan of historical novels, this is a must read.",
            "I thought the book was very good. I could not put it down. I absolutly hated the ending though. I wish I wouldn't of read the last.....150 pages. Oh well. I thought it was great anyway!!!",
            "I first read Gone With the Wind when I was fifteen . I read it again at twenty and have read it several times since. I am now forty years old and have read thousands of books and this book was and still is my all time favourite. there has never been a book so captivating , so romantic, so rebellious, so true to the south. Scarlett and Rhetts relationship is so full of fireworks it leaves the reader eagerly turning the page to see whats going to happen next. When I started a collection of all time classic books it was the first one I put on the bookshelf. I hope every young reader gets the chance to this fabulous novel.",
            "When Margret Mitchell wrote Gone With The Wind she probably never realized what an amazing story she began. The book combines romance with adventure. Scarlett O'Hara will always be remembered as one of the greatest characters of all time for her Irish ways and charming beauty.",
            "I read this book three years ago, but I couldn't help but write this review now. This book goes far beyond what humanly words can possibly say. This book sparked so many emotions in me, I thought I would die. Even at a few hundred pages left to experience, I was aching because it was coming to a close so fast. I can't count the number of times I cried, and how long I cried at the end. I didn't want to let go of the enchanting story, but I could never, ever read it again. This book truly touched me, and I'm saddened by the loss of this magnificent author. There'll never be another. God Bless You Miss Mitchell.",
            "Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind is my absolute favorite book. I enjoy books that have deeper meaning and make you think, but although this book lacks one it's a masterpiece all the same. Read it for the story and lose yourself in the Old South. P.S. The movie was great, but the book goes into much more detail and causes one to be much more drawn to the heroine.",
            "Gone With the Wind is the realization of an author's dream - to tell an American story of American attitudes in a deceptively treacherous society that became completely uprooted during an extended period of political turmoil in the United States. The characters are beautifully developed, the flavor of the period is flawlessly interwoven with the stories of the characters' lives, and we cling to each minor triumph and defeat as Mitchell works her way through this huge book. This is one book that you will want to read several times.",
            "As the ratings show, this book is accepted by many people to be the best book ever written, and I must agree. It has been a source of strength for me in hard times, and it guided me towards my love of writing.",
            "This is undoubtably one of the greatest, most gripping stories ever written. At first it's hard to get into, but- once Scarlett makes up her mind there's no stopping her and the adventure starts. Charles and Melly Hamilton, Ashley Wilkes, Aunt Pittypat and most of all Rhett Butler send Scarlett flying into confusion. With the war raging all around her, trying to support her family and friends, and trying to understand Rhett, Scarlett lives through a time of hardships and scorn, and bears it stubbornly. This book was gripping to the end, and left me thinking &quot;What happens next? You have to tell me! I just have to know!&quot; I am definitely going to read the sequel to this. Anyone who likes thrilling advinture, romance, and fiery heroines will love this book.",
            "This book is for those people who can't stand when a good book to come to an end. Also for those who like romance and loved the movie. You don't have to have seen the movie though to enjoy the book.",
            "I can't help admiring! The greatest creation of gifted author. Characters are picted so vividly! Scarlett seems nothing but spoilt chiled, and Rhett is a real Man, real Gentlemen - one you can trust. They live though Civil War, they learn to love, understand and forgive each other. I've read this book about 20 times and now I am looking for any chance to read it in English. Don&quot;t you think now that it is worth reading?",
            "I have read this book twice and each time it's as if I'm reading it for the first time. I loved both the book and the movie. The story is very passionate and expresses the powers of love. Rhett is the kind of person any woman wouldn't mind being married to.",
            "My mother read this book when she was 13. I read it when I was 13. I don't have a daughter, but if I did, I'd surely present her with a copy of this when she reached &quot;the age&quot;. Has your daughter read it? Don't settle for just the movie (although that's wonderful, too)! Read it!",
            "Truly amazing. I have read and reread this book several times. It never fails to amaze me how brilliantly Scarlett O'Hara is portrayed. And how such a spoiled brat could become so endeared by millions, including me. A first-rate love story that follows birth, death, and the horrid destruction of war. Please read this book, and cry for a lost civilization - the south.",
            "As this quote from the opening of the movie says, &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is a novel which truly brings us back to a different time, a time of southern gentlemen and hoop-skirted women. But if you've only seen the movie, you've only seen half the story. The novel describes the life of Scarlett O'Hara, southern belle, in much greater detail, and paints a vivid portrait of life and love in the Old South, and of the Civil War which destroyed it. This is an inspiring tale -- Scarlett is a strong-willed woman who faces the horrors of war and survives, rebuilding her life from nothing. &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is a wonderful story masterfully written. It truly gives us an insight into, as the movie says, &quot;a dream remembered, a civilization Gone With the Wind&quot;.",
            "I love &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;. When I was 14 my mother handed me the book and said it was the best book she had ever read. I looked at the size of the book and thought there was no way I would ever get through it. One day I began reading and I just couldn't stop. I was sad when I had finished it and asked myself the same question everyone does; what happend next? I gave the book to my best friend. She thought I was stupid, but since she had nothing better to do she read it. She soon learned I really wasn't stupid.",
            "My stepmom collects all things Gone With The Wind so this was a perfect gift for her at a decent price. The book came in its own case and did not have a scratch or mark of any kind on it. My stepmom loved her perfect present and do did my pocketbook.",
            "I have always loved Gone With the Wind. I found this edition here on Amazon and had my husband give it to me for Christmas. It is lovely. Book was in really good condition, too.",
            "The story begins with Scarlett O'Hara flirting outside her home with the Tarleton twins. The inciting incident was evident when Scarlett finds out that her beloved Ashley Wilkes is marrying that dreadful Melanie. The entire book spans the time of the Civil War and some reconstruction era. Gone with the Wind is a brilliant epic because it's about a love triangle and a young woman who is trying to find her place in the world. The setting is quite vivid, and if you live in the south, you know the heat and the vermillion sky. Of course, to read the book, even the name conjures up the images of Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable. The book itself, a classic indeed, isn't special. The words are verbose and at times rather pretentious. What makes this story amazing are the memorable characters.Scarlett O'Hara is the most obnoxious human being ever, but she's sympathetic. Thebook is at least honest in that it shows her motives. While other characters in the bookmisinterpret her greed and manipulation as strength, the reader knows Scarlett is quite selfish and egocentric. We see her continuous struggle with what society tells her and what makes perfect sense. The reader applauds her tenacity and refusal to accept hardships. Of course, in the book she's only 16.Rhett Butler is also rather vile as a womanizing, selfish renegade with little regard for the ways of high society. He's an older man by the standards of the 1860s at 27. What makes him so special is that he makes it quite clear that he can have sex any woman he wants, but he doesn't want to have mindless sex.He wants someone that interests him, can think for themselves, and he wants their attention. This person is Scarlett. Rhett is a man who knows what he wants. Of course, it's clear to the reader his acts of kindness aren't kindness but manipulated ways to get a hold of Scarlett.Ashley is the contrast to Rhett, a moral and kind man who is drawn to Scarlett but he loves Melanie. Ashley loves the idea of history, literature, and high society. Melanie is Scarlett's contrast. While everyone hates Scarlett, Melanie loves her and that drives Scarlett nuts.At the end of the book, the characters are the most memorable part of the book and considered a classic.",
            "There are few adjectives left, that hasn't been used to describe this book. Someone has written, that all Americans, should read this book, while they still can. The shipping was excellent and the book, is in better condition than described,and at very reasonable rates, an easy 5 Star Rating.",
            "I ordered this book due to the fact that my other one got destroyed....little siblings lol. The book cover is different from the one in the picture. The pic showed a blue cover with a gold like color for the title. The cover on the book I now have is of a man (Rhett) holding a women (Scarlett in his arms.. The book arrived a few weeks after having ordered it but thats ok. I wasn't about to allow my bookshelf to live out its life w/o having one of America's best classics on it. The book arrived in good condition and Im happy:)",
            "Bought this as a request for a friend who had seen the movie and wanted to have the book as part of her Margaret Mitchell collection. Buying from Amazon guaranteed that the item was shipped on time, well packaged and equally was budget friendly.",
            "I read this book in its entirety when I was 13 or 14, and of course I know far more now than I did then. I feel that if you can read this book with its historical context in mind and just appreciate it as a period piece and an exciting story, you'll be fine.I was thinking today about the fact that I read this book shortly after I read Little Women, the story of the March sisters whose dad was fighting the Civil War as a soldier for the Union. The contrast is great because while Alcott's book is filled with so many upstanding citizen types, Mitchell's story is peppered with the roguish Rhett Butler, the self-centered Scarlett, and an assortment of amoral characters. A few stand out as worthy of admiration--Melanie of course, Scarlett's mother, and Scarlett's beloved Mammy.I don't recall this book with the sentimentality that I hold for a simpler classic, such as Little Women. I loved the excitement, the adventure, the ironies. It thrilled me when Scarlett delivered Melanie's baby all by herself and when she said, \"As God as my witness, I'll never be hungry again,\" and proceeded to pick cotton in the fields like a \"common field hand\" as I think she put it. Her crush on Ashley thrilled me, and their long-awaited kiss was well worth waiting for! Somehow I couldn't quite cotton to the roguish, worldly Rhett and so their romance didn't thrill me, but nevertheless I was crushed when he abandoned her at the end. I remember asking my mom, \"Why?\" I just didn't understand why he couldn't have forgiven someone he supposedly loved so much.Just as in Little Women, I loved hearing about the fashions and balls. I tried to imagine what it would have been like to have been as popular as Scarlett! The obsession with thinness, so similar to our world with all the Jennifer Anistons today, interested me greatly. Imagine a 17-inch waist!I doubt whether I understood fully why she kicked Rhett out of her bedroom when she discovered that her waist measured a full 20 inches, leading her to the decision to stop having babies after Bonnie. And I'm embarrassed to admit that I thought Bonnie was a spoiled little girl, a miniature Scarlett, and I didn't cry when she died. But I cried when Melanie died, the woman who Scarlett had looked down upon all her life, only to finally realize that she was a great person.So much drama, so much excitement--wasn't it Melanie who suggested to Scarlett that they search the Union soldier's pockets after Scarlett had killed him when he entered Tara? I'm not sure but I remember that scene vividly from both the book and the movie when they realized that they'd both be raped by the home invader if they didn't do something fast!When I read this book as a young teen, I'd never read anything quite so adventurous or sophisticated. I'd never even seen the term \"sexual intercourse\" in print before, and now I was reading that Scarlett liked kissing, but marital relations didn't really appeal to her. My first adult book and I ate it up.If you can get past your hatred for the glamourization of slavery and see this book as a story from history, it's quite a fascinating tale. I mean who else but Scarlett O'Hara would fashion a dress from drapes and go to visit Rhett in jail in the hope of seducing him and achieving financial security for her and her family. Forgive me, but I can't help but picture Carol Burnett doing a skit as Scarlett, wearing the drapes, rod and all!This book probably deserves five stars just because it's a grand epic, but I need more of a love story, more inspiration than I found here. When the final words of a book are, \"Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn,\" this is too harsh for me.",
            "I fell in love with Gone With The Wind at age 14 when my mother gave me a copy. Now--many decades and books later--it is still my favorite book ever. I realize that it may seem dated to 21st century readers. But it was written in the mid-1930s, when society was vastly different. No other book has ever captured my imagination like GWTW. And Scarlett O'Hara Hamilton Kennedy Butler is hands-down my all-time favorite character. Yes, she was vain and selfish and willful, and spent years deluding herself about Ashley Wilkes. But she was also very brave and intelligent (and beautiful). While the rest of her family sat back bemoaning the past, Scarlett literally saved Tara. In my opinion, she was a surprisingly modern woman who, unfortunately, was ahead of her time. She lived in an era when strong, independent women were not acknowledged or respected... and for this, she paid a high price.Even though I loved Vivien Leigh's portrayal of Scarlett, I much prefer the book over the movie. GWTW is a book that can be revisited over and over again. I know I'll never get tired of reading it.",
            "Probably one of the very greatest fiction books of all time. Ms. Mitchell wrote a classic here with all the details of the Civil War enmeshed with Scarlett O'Hara and her tempetuous personality. Made into the movie in 1939 (and won the Best Picture Oscar that year), the book offers no disappointments. A true classic!",
            "I love Gone with the Wind it is my all time favorite book and movie. I found the movie edition on Amazon and just had to get it. The binding is coming off and I have to find someone who can fix it. But it is a great addition to my book collection. I am actually afraid to read it. It is sitting next to my copy of Rebecca of Sunnybrooke Farm movie edition book.",
            "My mother requested this book for Christmas. We had gone together to see the movie years ago and it is one of her favorite stories. I purchased the book for a Christmas gift for her and she loved it!",
            "If you've not read this book, you better start right now! An unsurpassable classic...doesn't get any better than this...enough said.",
            "Mch more interesting than the movie.There is more character development,you understand why some people did the thingsthat they did",
            "Have to have such a classic in your home library. Nice shape. Good service. Will be a nice re-read this winter.",
            "It has been a long time since I read GWTW and hated Scarlett. I reread it with an adult's perspective of hardships, tough knocks and suffering, and while I still don't like Scarlett, I've come away with a greater appreciation of the hardships of living in an occupied land, 19th century societal expectations of women in the U.S.; and the tumult of changing social norms from one century to the next. It is a fascinating read.",
            "I can't believe it took me this long to get around to this book. It is honestly the best book I ever read.",
            "I remember reading this book a long time ago because I liked the movie. The book is definitely better. It's a very long book, over a thousand pages but a good story about love and determination.",
            "I fell in love with the movie first, so I thought i would give the book a try. For those who loved the movie, the depth of the characters and complicated feelings it brings, the book is even better. I love that it gives insight into characters that the movie doesn't have a chance to expound on.I always finish the movie wanting just a little more. The book helps satisfy a bit of that. Even having seen the movie countless times, the book was still a page turner.Some are offended at the glorification of the south and the misrepresentation of slavery in the book. I don't think it's wrong to find the perspective represented as very idealistic. But maybe take it more as a book written from the warped view that some probably had about their relationships with their slaves. It really is about the end of a civilization and their entire way of life.",
            "It is a wonderful classic and I enjoy it so much I savor the time I get to read it. It goes so much faster on my kindle.",
            "This copy is pretty much what the First Edition looked like in 1936 and it's easy to see how it got to be so big. Not until The Godfather was published had there been so much interest in a book and its inevitable film version. Impresses to this day and you can see the masterwork the film's screenwriters performed in getting this sprawling story onto the screen. I think every American should read this through at least once.God help the pukes making movies in this era who think they need to \"reboot\" this story... Also, don't bother with the \"authorized\" sequels; the story stands on its own.",
            "Great condition. I am really enjoying it. Can't believe it took me 68 years to finally read this.",
            "It was a very loooong book but really good! Usually with long books there's always a part that drags on forever but it never felt that way with this book. It always kept my interest and the ending was different and not at all what I expected, which is a good thing.",
            "I have always been a lover of the film, but I am so glad I finally read this book. It was packed with fascinating history and a wonderful set of characters. It is a long book, but definitely worth the effort! Its epic story and beautifully written dialogue paint a picture of the Confederacy, its fall and Reconstruction. This is a story of survival and the pure gumption it takes to get ahead. I recommend this book to anyone who likes a good read!",
            "I saw the movie GWTW as a kid, but the memory faded over time. I never thought to read the book, but took it out of the library on audio CD. What a wonderful, memorable, amazing book. Scarlett, Wrett, Ashley and Melanie are extraordinary portraits, and anyone interested in US history will find much to enjoy with the story set against the Civil War.Linda Stephens audio CD narration is spot-on, painting a nuanced compelling portrait of the characters and story.So worth going beyond the film!",
            "I wish Margaret Mitchell had written more than one book. She was a talented writer and one of the best story tellers. Love her vivid description of war scenes and dialogues. Truly a classic, a great piece of American literature!",
            "I love this book. I love these characters. I love how it's 1,000 pages long, so you don't have to leave the amazing world depicted too soon. I love how you can curl up with this book and read it for hours on end and never come to the last page. It's so completely absorbing, so real and life-like, so undeniably painted, that it's more than classic. It's a masterpiece. I asked for this book for my Confirmation present, and I will cherish it and show it to my children and my children's children. I hope to God that this book is never forgotten. It is simply beautiful and romantic.",
            "I really enjoyed reading this long novel and have to say that I was sad when it was over. Aside from being very easy to read and an interesting story line, the settings in rural Georgia and Atlanta during the civil war provide a realistic historical feel that you don't get from reading history books on the civil war. I have since read a history book on Sherman's march to the sea and realize that the general descriptions in Gone With The Wind about what happened to the residents of Georgia are true. Whether you want a more personal insight into what life was like during the Civil War in the south, or just a really enjoyable book to read, I would highly recommend Gone With The Wind. Also, ignore some of the book covers that make this book look like a love story, it is a book of equal interest to men and women in my opinion.",
            "Scarlett O'Hara was never intended to be the heroine in this novel, but like all dynamic characters, she took over the tale. In reality, Margaret Mitchell wrote Melanie as the heroine, and I think the fact that Melanie shines so gently throughout the tale is one of the many things about this novel that makes it exceptional.Mitchell wrote this novel because she wanted to show how different women managed to survive the American Civil War. Thus, Melanie, Scarlett, India, and Ellen. These women each coped differently to outlive the greatest war of their century in America, and the fact that Scarlett stood so high above the others is a testament to her larger-than-life validity.This novel is, and shall forever more be, my favorite piece of literature.",
            "This book has been a personal favorite of mine since I was in Elementary School. Yes, I was born a book worm with an advanced reading level. I was named for Ashley from this very book and my brother was named for Rhett so I was required to read it, but not required to like it I just happened to fall in love with Margaret Mitchell and her story. It tells so many stories in one and has such an appeal to it no wonder it is still going strong after almost 75 years. I would recommend this book to anyone, although girls seem to enjoy it more as it is told by Scarlett's point of view. Scarlett is the girl you love to hate. She is so endearing and strong but so young and naive that you want to hit her and shelter her at the same time. Rhett is a man's man and women across the world want to have him. He exudes all that is strong and masculine while being head over heels in love with Scarlett and their baby girl. Ashley is a pity case as he is torn and used. Melanie is a personal favorite of mine, like a pet kitten. She is fierce and strong with claws of steel but purrs and mews with the innocence and undying love of a newborn baby kitten. All of the characters are developed well and are all very rounded. You will get lost in this time period and forget what a cell phone is.",
            "At the insistence of a friend, I picked up Gone with the Wind to see what all the hubbub was about. I expected a shallow romance novel, much like the movie it spawned, complete with the longing stares and the yearning desires of a woman who has been spited by circumstance. I could not have been more surprised to find so much more.What I found was a novel that is surprisingly layered. The outermost layer, of course, is the romantic narrative many will recognize, but beneath this superficial casting resides a deeper narrative about the tragic hubris, resulting fall, and struggle to reemerge by a small class of Southern aristocrats. As this historical narrative unfolds, additional layers advance and recede in waves, each ushered in with insightful dialogue and commentary by the book's fascinating characters.At the base of their hubris, for example, is layered an adolescent confidence in the invincibility of King Cotton and the superiority of the antebellum order, which one character ridicules and one character fears will prove all too true. Surrounding their fall, their economic and political naivety retreats before scarcity, Sherman, and a struggle to survive, all of which is replaced by a remarkable perseverance that is more a testament to the antebellum order than anything before the war. As their struggle plays out in the treacherous climate of Reconstruction, it eventually turns into a modest triumph capped by tragedy and accompanied by ominous undertones of the segregated order to come.Other layers abound and while each is fascinating in its own right, together they are interwoven to present an even more fascinating and coherent telling of the most tumultuous period in American history. Rather than shallow, Gone with the Wind is exceptionally deep, its characters eminently profound, and its telling extremely satisfying.",
            "GWTW is simply the most beautifully tragic work of literary art of the 20th century. Margaret Mitchell not only recaptures a lost shadow world, but she also creates characters of enduring depth and passion. Upon analyzing the characters it is easy to see how Melanie and Scarlett represent the two natures of woman as Rhett and Ashley represent the two natures of man . This two fold nature of man and woman, depicts the spiritual, emotional, physical, and material struggle of each sex. This heart breaking tale is not so much reflective a lost romance, but reflective of the inner and environmental struggle and development of the self and all that it entails.As for the \"sequel\"- yes on a surface level it satisfies those who are seeking closure. But that is the problem. There is no closure and that is what the rightful author intended. It is heart breaking yes, but that in and of itself offers a deep lesson to the reader. The heartbreak emcompasses not just the lost love between Rhett and Scarlett, Scarlett and Ashley, and Scarlett and Melanie- but the heartbreak of a time lost, pride forsaken, shame never to be laid to rest, and the stark reality of future yet known.All in all this is a breathtaking tragic journey that will ravage your heart and soul. Any serious literary reader will find timeless strength in these 1000+ pages of glory had and glory lost.",
            "I purchased several years ago, and I can't remember how many times I have read it. No matter how many times you do, the story always seems fresh. My paperback copy is falling apart, so I think I am going to purchase the hardcover version. My advice is to spend a little more on the hardcover, because once you have read this novel you will be hooked.",
            "What more can I say about this book. Only that it is second to the Bible in greatness and I that could be argued. I have read it before several times and each time I get something diffetent out of it.I was skeptical about getting the audiobook because a bad narrator can ruin a good book. However, Linda Stevens does justice and then some to all the regional dialects and takes nothing away from Margaret Mitchell's masterpeice.",
            "Gone with the wind is probably one of the best books i ever read.(let me tell you first that it took me an AWFULLY LONG TIME to read GWTW because im form mexico, so english is not my language.there were times when i tought i wasnt going to be able to finish it, but i kept on going and i finally did it)GWTW is really special for me because i read it when i was going through some really hard times and it really helped me to not give up.reading about scarlett and all the things that happend to her, and the way she used the people an the things around her so she could get what she wanted was really fun and inspiring.i took for myself her always useful \"charm\" I wont think about it now, ill think about it tomorrow.\" and it has really worked for me. everyone who likes to read a good story should read GWTW. you will grow fond of the characters in no time.the only thing i didnt like about it is that sometimes it can get really confusing , there were parts in the book i had to read twice so i could follow with the story. but in general its a really good book, and i am sure you will enjoy it as much as i did.",
            "This is one of the most memorable lines of all time. And uttered by Scarlett many times throghout the book, give it a fatalistic reality. Anybody who has ever been young, in love, would fall in love with Scarlett O'Hara, the greatest heroine of all time. Her charms are many and so are her bouts of temper, her fears, her desperations, her perceptions of life. This book is simply outstanding in every aspect. Margarett Mitchelle skillfully puts Scarlett's life under the microscope and disects it ruthlessly to give you a clear picture of youth, the pride of youth which is, believe me, terrible to behold, the vanity which rules the day, the plain pigheadedness that early age has and the heartbreak that follows when youth is gone overnight and adulthood encraoches.Don't at all be scared by the lenght of the book, it is very readable. I read this book for the first time when I was 14 and still had absolutely no trouble reading it, that says a lot about its readability. For 6 days I did little else than read with urgency to disclose Scarlett's fate. The book is so splendidly written, so complete in its rendition of that age, that from cover to cover that it encloses a world that is no more and exsists only in those pages. To think that this book was actually written 73 years after the Civil War of America began in 1860, is awe-inspiring in the sense that it seems the author could have had no means about knowing that civilization, the way she does with a completeness that is all encompassing, which was destroyed in that war, had not she been a part of it, saw the sun of those times, breathed the air that blew over Atlanta (where most of the story is based) and had the notions which she shared with those people. This is writing at its pinnacle of magnificience. She staight away begins the story from the word go in a no-nonsense way. There are no lenghty introductions of any kind, no changing in time frames or point of views (we solely see Scarlett's mind in the book though the book is in the first person), no telling about events even before they happen and the retrospection , if any, comes only on the charcters parts.And a very important thing, disbelieve all that jargon about it being in the greatest love story of all time. Infact it isn't a love story at all. Of course Scarlett does fall in love and has crushes that go nowhere, but the aim of the story is not to relate a mushy love affair but what circumstances do to people, how people are changed by the deeds they perform and how thay influence each other.We watch Scarlett fall in love. We watch her love with a passion and pursue her object of desire with a ruthlessness that only extreme youth is calable of. We watch her hate, with a coolness that is chilling to observe, hatred that only can be generated by hurt pride and stained vanity.Scarlett is young and beautiful and rich and brimming with life and health, no sorrow can touch her, and she sets out to conquer the world. Why should she not have everything she wants, every petty fancy fulfilled, every man falling in love with her? We know that the world dosent let such people be, these people invite almost too much jealosy, the world is very cruel to such people. So when the world does slap her across her face, she declares war aginst the world with her head held high. And still she is not a larger than life character, its as you or I would have reacted in such a situation, when you lived in a society in which she lived, if the world in which you lived was falling apart and war arrived at your doorstep. It potrays every kind of emotion a human ever went through and in all its splendor and glory.This story is also about tumultous times. It is the story of the Old South where innocent people lived the life of kings which is only present in memory. They are invincible in their paradise of cotton plantations and tea parties, but when war cuts through their lives like a knife, you can't but feel sorry for these people whose world ceases to exsist, and they live the rest of their lives serching like children for a meaning in their life they know isn't there, for an identity that has been erased, for salvation that will never come. Their inevitable tragedy breaks your heart and set at the heart of this interwining ouilt work of humanity lies the story of Scarlett. We see how she influences people around her and is changed herself in return by what she encounters.All in all the book is a treasure, one of the greatest contributions of America to the world of fiction and a must read for all generations. I recommend this book with all my heart. Read it and you'll thank the memory of Margarett Mitchelle for creating this piece of art.",
            "The book I am doing a review on is Gone With the Wind. This book is by the author Margaret Mitchell. This story is about an independent teenage girl named Scarlett O'Hara who lives in Georgia before the Civil War. She is in love with a boy named Ashley, and plans to be with him but he is arranged to be married with another girl, so Scarlett makes a big plan to make him hers, but before she can do it the Civil War breaks out and complicates everything for her. The front and back cover made me want to read it. If you are a person who loves adventure, suspense, and romance, then you should definitely read this book. This book is targeted for people between the ages of 15 and 70.The good thing about this book is that it has a plot that seems at some points seem irrelevant but are actually very important to the outcome of the resolution. If the book had even more conflicts then it would be even better because the conflicts make the story nail biting like this excerpt from the book. \"Somebody hollerin',\" said Porky uneasily. \"The Yankees are coming! I saw them! Down the road! The Yankees ---,\" Another thing I like about the book is that it has Scarlett, the main character, is a perfect mix of flare and emotions like this excerpt from the book. \"I don't want your advice,\" yelled Scarlett. I think this book has anything that I didn't like but if there were it would probably be the way there are many characters, but it sort of makes the story better, but for me it gets me confused sometimes like in this excerpt of the book. \"Well push Randa off you, Betsy, and hush. Now listen to me Gerald O'Hara.\" My overall opinion off the book is that I liked it very much. I think I like it so much because it contains a plot and setting that takes place in many different locations, it's not just stationary. So again, I think you should read this book because it contains vivid vocabulary, has triumphs and downfalls that make the story better, and has takes advantage of the readers' sense of adventure, and after watch the movie.",
            "A simply superb novel; it has become my favorite book. People of all ages can appreciate this masterpiece; I'm 16 and I couldn't put it down (not for food, sleep, or a six and a half hour flight), my 13 year old sister loved it, my little brother cried at the end, and an elderly woman and her husband, I met on the afore mentioned flight, said to me it was one of the best books of all time. &lt;space>Even though I had seen the movie -which I also love- so I knew what was going to happen, I wept uncontrollably. This is a must have and worth the 1024 or so pages. At the conclusion of this novel, the fact that it isn't any longer is the only disapointment. Reading it is a supreme pleasure.",
            "I agree with the hundreds...wait, millions of people over the years who've enjoyed this classic. Despite her charater not being too sympathetic, Scarlett is a real survivor and that's why we still care for her. If you haven't read the book because you already enjoyed the movie, you are really missing a lot.",
            "Oh, how I suffer for my enjoyment of this book! When I told a prospective lover that this was my fave tome, he recoiled in white liberal revulsion, demanding if I'd read `Roots'. The truth is that I have never read GWTW for the racism, and condemning it almost seems superfluous. I take it as read that this is a work of its time, written in the 1930s which harked back to the days of slavery and the ante-bellum South. A `Wuthering Heights' of the Confederacy, with its two passionate leads and wishy-washy support acts. Margaret Mitchell spend ten years writing GWTW, and it's perhaps thanks to her husband John Marsh, who persuaded her to write rather than read. After all she was an Atlanta journo in the 1920s and not short of a story or two... just what to do with them. The result is a 1000 page plus commotion which spans the years and charts the travels of various types, as they wind their way from having it all to down on their uppers to getting back up again. None more so than Scarlett O'Hara, who, fed up with playing the feminine card (which she nonetheless does to the hilt), benefits from the destruction of Southern life inasmuch as she answers her true calling - to be a better businessman than the boys. For which she pays the price of emotional loss, albeit of her own daft making.MM wrote at a time when many were denied the enfranchisement that we all deserve. And like many other works of the past, she falls foul of the politically correct watershed. But ignore the broadsheet bores if you dare, and see this novel for when it was conceived. And then relish the familiar themes of survival and in love with love and you might just enjoy it.",
            "The power of this narrative of the American Civil War and the Reconstruction period after the war is overwhelming. Scarlett O'Hara is the centerpiece of this story from the beginning to the end. It is much more than a story of love, rivalry, and misadventure. It is all that and more. It offers the reader a portrait of the Confederacy and the candid view of life there as filtered through the eyes of Scarlett. It is Melanie Hamilton and Ashley Wilkes who represent the values of the old South and the ambition of Scarlett and the cynicsm of Rhett Butler reflect the newly emerging South of the Reconstruction.",
            "It's racist and sexist, and some parts drag on a little too much, yet it made my heart flutter with delight. I love it when books make you feel like this one made me. It started off slowly, but 200 pages into it I was hooked.Scarlett, she's self absorbed and as thick as a brick, but some how loveable. Rhett, why he's condescending yet somehow so wise and sexy. And sweet Melly, while she is a goody-two-shoe, she is never annoying, quiet loveable. She has an inner strength. The characters come alive on the pages.Any book that makes me cry is a good book. Oh, and did I cry! THere were parts where I was blubering for ages. In other parts, my heart was racing and I couldn't read the page fast enough.Well, this book offically rocks my socks, and is one of my favourite books, ahead of Jane Eyre and Pride and Prejudice. Why oh why didn't I read this earlier?!? 6/5 stars!",
            "Gone Wind the Wind is famous for many reasons. First, its characters are so deep and certainly born with human flaws. The plot is amazing; it is neither cliche or \"dumb\". Mitchell has done an excellent job in her historical research - it's as if you were really there in that place and era!Scarlett and Rhett are some of the best characters in all literature. Some may hate Scarlett, although I don't know why. She is unique, intelligent, beautiful, and knows what she wants. You can't blame a pretty face for knowing she is pretty. And besides, she is not so superficial or mean as one may immediately suspect - Scarlett is a three-dimensional character who learns many lessons in the end. She is certainly amusing and vain, and you have to love her for it!Although I did not like the ending at first, it now occurs to me that it was reasonable. Scarlett has made a lot of mistakes, and you can't blame Rhett for not wanting to put up with it all anymore.I know most people will enjoy this book, and it is not racist. It appears to be to the ignorant mind, but you have to understand that people spoke and behaved in such ways at this era. You cannot have black people and whites living in harmony during the Civil War, 1860's, right? This is a historical novel. And besides, doesn't anyone remember that Scarlett mentions how her black nanny is always there for her, is trustworthy and good? She does not disrespect African Americans.",
            "I read over 150 books a year, and I always have read a lot. I don't go for romance at all, but this book is so much more than that. The writing is fantastic. The vocabulary is diverse. The imagery. The characters. The plots within plots. You are there. You know the characters intimately. This is the most amazing work of fiction I have ever laid eyes on.I'm not big on re-reading things, but I've read this novel many, many times. Buy it. Read it. Treasure it.If you're \"offended by the racism,\" please try to keep in mind that political correctness will destroy your education. And whether or not this book is racist (can a _book_ be racist?) does nothing to diminsh from its genius.",
            "There were times in this book when I would be so absorbed in the story that I lost all track of time and would be surprised to discover that things had changed about in my house because everyone else was continuing on with real life.This book is so vividly portrayed. Sometimes you can almost feel the heat, hear the flies buzzing, smell the smoke from the burning buildings, hear ladies in fancy shoes schlooching through the mud.This is an epic classic. The story follows Scarlet, a hard-bitten-or-is-she Southern belle, as she goes about the process of living just before, during, and after the Civil War. It's an amazing book for any number of reasons. One, a woman writes about war and just about blows the socks off the idea that only men can do that. Two, nearly every character you meet is a well-developed person, not just some caricature. Three, details of life like cooking, nursing babies (yes, breastfeeding...), eating, dressing, flirting, dancing, everything is there. I'm surprised there isn't any toilet scene, so much is covered here. Four, tragedies of every sort occur, from Scarlet and Rhett's love story to Scarlet and Ashley's love story to Scarlet and Melanie's friendship to the loss of Bonnie. So many things happen.If you ever thought that the Civil War was a right and just war and that the South got what it deserved, consider reading this just for the opportunity to challenge your conventions and long-held beliefs.",
            "&quot;There was a Land of Cavaliers and Cotton Fields called the Old South. . .Here in this pretty world Gallantry took its last bow. . .Look for it only in books, for it is no more than a dream remembered. A Civilization Gone with the Wind.&quot;What other words could more perfectly describe the saga of Gone with the Wind?I am always astounded when I think that the 1024 pages of Gone with the Wind was Margaret Mitchell's first book! How can a green author roll so much passion, hope, strength, love, steadfastness, despair and humanity into a single novel? I blows me away, no pun intended!As reviewer kitam57 said &quot;I love Scarlett and yet at the same time I want to wring her neck.&quot; I totally concur, I admire Scarlett for her determination, her dedication to her family, her love of the land and her uniqueness. I'm more than half Irish and I too have a love for the land I live on just like Scarlett developed for Tara, as her father said &quot;It's the only thing that lasts&quot; and truly, even when Scarlett had nothing else she still had Tara and was willing to do anything, even prostitute herself to Rhett in order to keep it. She wasn't afraid to go out and break many of the social conventions of the time, like peddling lumber while pregnant, in order to take care of her family and loved ones. But at the same time, I HATE her treatment of Rhett, Scarlett had one giant blindspot by the name of Ashley Wilkes. Although, Ashley did lead her on, he never would say that he didn't love her and only loved Mellie. Scarlett clung to this hope, she pretended to hate Rhett the whole time and really deep down she knew she always liked him. I just can't understand why Scarlett thought she loved Ashley so much, he was dreamer, lost in books, music and Europe while Scarlett was practical, living for each day and facing up to harsh realities without a second thought.Rhett was always hopelessly in love with Scarlett too. It breaks my heart every time I see him try in the book and she just blows him off. When he was released from prison he ran straight to Scarlett to make sure she had enough money to keep Tara, when Scarlett tells him she's pregnant again he's so happy, and when he thinks Scarlett will die I cry too when he is nearly crazy with grief and sobbing into Mellie's skirts! There was still a chance for them later if she had just opened up and admitted that they had both been wrong! And that &quot;hungry&quot; look of Rhett's that Scarlett was always a bit scared of, it was really Rhett's starvation for love. He was watching her, waiting and hoping that she might show him some sign of love, as he said he wanted when they first danced together. Rhett's weakness was Scarlett and his need for her love, for once in his life he wanted someone to TRULY love him, not look down on him! And then tragedy enters in.Rhett of course has his scoundrel tendancies, but I admire him also for his rebellion against social conventions, he wasn't tied in by stupid traditions. he was more thinking than the rest, in that respect he and Ashley were more alike. Rhett and Ashley both knew what a war would do to the South and what a disadvantage they were at with troups and artillery. As Rhett said: &quot;I seem to be spoiling everyone's brandy, cigars and DREAMS of victory.&quot; Rhett's humanity always shows through in his admiration of Melanie, she was the one person he always treated with absolute sincerity and genuine respect.There also is the war aspect, Margaret Mitchell seems to have examined every tiny detail of the the South both during and after the war. She knows of the hardships, devastation, the starvation, the struggle, the indignities and humiliation of Reconstruction. One must always remember that just because people owned slaves, it didn't mean they were all bad people. Some were, we all know of the atrocious horrors that slaves suffered but, Margaret Mitchell shows the almost family-like relationships some people shared with their slaves. They do talk down to them and treat them as children, but slaves were not always educated at the time and therefore some didn't know how to act any differently. Mammy however is the perfect example of the smartest woman in the whole book! She always knew what was going on and loved Scarlett as her own child no matter what depths Scarlett sank to.I love the movie as well, Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable were Scarlett and Rhett brought to life, it's like they were born to play those roles! My only complaint is that they should have shown Scarlett's children with Charles and Frank in the film! However, I will always applaud the scene of Scarlett and Rhett dancing around in black amongst all the other colorful people. They are declaring their defiance and I completely admire that! In fact, I love the story of Gone with the Wind so much that I named my horse India after Ashley's sister. Next one I should name Scarlett! :)All in all, Gone with the Wind is a book for all time, no matter what your genre of book is, you will be able to appreciate it for the many dimensions of it and the ultimate truth, history, life lessons and basic human tenacity it portrays. No matter who you are, where you live or how old you are.",
            "What can I say? I am so glad to finally and proudly join the GONE WITH THE WIND readers. I have tried reading this book for years. I am SO glad I put nose to grindstone. Once I got into the story I was reading every chance I could get. And now that I am done, I am rereading snippets ... not willing to let the story go yet.What a miraculous book, a miraculous accomplishment, a masterful writer. The writing is eerily alive. Simply a brilliant brilliant work.The book is very true to the times. I have read many first hand accounts of that era, including hundreds of Slave Narratives and Margaret Mitchell told it like it was. To say this book is racist is just plain stupidity.We shouldn't read history because it's just not nice, it's just not the way we would do things, us being such enlightened souls.Waaah. Waah.How stupid. This book is about another place and time. DUH. Do a search on Black slave owners and Black confederates if you dare.As far as the human relationships in this book I rode a roller coaster.I personally loved the loyalty shown between slave and owners. &quot;they are part of our family&quot; It's true to the way it really was except the slave narratives are even more emotional and dramatic stating over and over &quot;I just want to go to heaven and see my mastus and missus again. They are the best on the whole world&quot; It's incredible. I am not talking about the selected slave narratives telling all manner of horror. I am talking about he Federal Works project that talked to actual ex-slaves and their families.As for Rhett, I had a hard time liking him. He was dashing at first but his &quot;career&quot; during the war turned me off. His fine clothes and such while people starved bothered me.... But then he proposed to Scarlet and he was so romantic and I started to really like him. I even liked him in the parlor scene when he was drunk and tortured over Scarlet's wandering heart.But by the end I didn't like him much again. I thought it was really scoundrelish of him to simply say &quot;I'm tired of it, I'm tired of you&quot; Frankly my dear I don't give a damn.Him and Scarlet had both sunk so low. I didn't like their long violent fights. It really pained me. When Scarlet was sick ... oh that broke my heart how Rhett cried into Mellie's skirt.If only... If only ...That is a very difficult part to swallow with this book ... and yet it is still a &quot;right&quot; end.I loved Ashley for his Southerness and Melanie was a beautifully wrought character. I wish Scarlet would have proclaimed her love for her more surely though. They could have lain on the bed and recounted all they had been through together.This is not just a book. It is an experience.I am SO glad that Margaret Mitchell wrote this book, a book from the South. I hope it remains in print. A people and a way of life that is Gone With The Wind will always deserve to be heard and understood.",
            "Why didn't I read this magnificent book before I was 49 years old?Perhaps because it tends to be classified in the &quot;historical romance&quot; genre ... because it was a vast popular success ... followed by a blockbuster movie ... it isn't taken seriously as a classic. It wasn't on academic reading lists, while works such as William Faulkner's &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; and Carson McCullers' &quot;The Heart is a Lonely Hunter&quot; were. But it should be.Probably GWTW couldn't have been written at any other time than it was, or by anyone else. When Margeret Mitchell was born in 1900, many living adults had been through the war and reconstruction years, and were there to tell her about it. Hers was the last generation to grow up before radio, when the oral tradition remained vital and dominant. Yet, as a child of the suffragist era and somewhat of a social rebel (engaged once, married twice, etc.), Mitchell's feisty personality is expressed through Scarlett O'Hara with rich comic effect. I frequently burst out loud laughing at Scarlett's outrageously self-serving rationalizations, and the scandalous breaches of etiquette she perpetrates. This is anything but melodrama or bodice-ripper romance. It is sophisticated social comedy, as well as historical drama and tragedy.Scarlett O'Hara, Rhett Butler, and Ashley and Melanie Wilkes endure in cultural memory to this day because Margaret Mitchell takes us into their world so convincingly that they seem real, with all their strengths, weaknesses, vanities and foibles. She has an unerring ear for dialogue. The black servants are vivid characters, pictured sympathetically as generally speaking their minds and being their authentic selves, in contrast to the ego-preserving dissembling and self-delusion of the whites.Despite the entangling of Scarlett's life with Rhett, Ashley and Melanie throughout the story, old Mammy -- the matron of the servants -- is the character who graces both the first and last pages of the book along with Scarlett. She is the only one who never betrays or leaves Scarlett; who stands with her till the end.Books about the Civil War era and its aftermath must number in the tens of thousands. But none brings it alive and lets you see it, feel it and remember it as GWTW does. It is a masterpiece, a monumental achievement.What does GWTW mean to me? At my grandmother's gravesite in East Texas, nearby tombstones cite the deceased's CSA affiliation ... 1st N.C. Cavalry, and so forth. These old soldiers migrated west after the war, just as Margaret Mitchell describes. They were my great-grandparents' generation. Margaret Mitchell brought their world alive to me as no one else ever did or could.Thank you, Margaret Mitchell, for your magnificent life's work.",
            "I can't belive i made it to 30 without reading the novel! I had seen the movie countless times and always liked it. But when I finally picked up the book and decided it was high time I read it, I was blown away. I'm captivated by Scarletts strength and courage, her honesty, and even her vanity. I couldn't put it down and now I'm ready to start all over again. If you haven't given this book a chance, do it now! You'll wish you had read it at 16.",
            "Margaret Mitchell impressed me by writing an 800 page novel about a character I sometimes wanted to strangle but about whom I couldn't read enough. Scarlett O'Hara might be self-absorbed, provincial, and manipulative, but she also displays courage, resourcefulness, and determination. Gone with the Wind is more than just a love story; it chronicles Scarlett's growth from a spoiled planter's daughter to the head of a household struggling to survive the ravages of the Civil War and Reconstruction. Mitchell provides a fascinating depiction of the psychology of the South, which plays a critical role in Scarlett's story. To thrive, she finds she must alienate the remnants of her former life and accept the presence of the Northern invaders. Throughout Scarlett wrestles with her feelings for Ashley Wilkes, a noble refugee from the genteel past, and Rhett Butler, a scalawag building his fortune from the ashes of the confederacy. Many more wonderfully drawn characters fill out this novel, which already feels somewhat compressed despite its length. It's no wonder the movie version is four hours long; the novel has too much too good to leave out!",
            "This book is just one of the best books ever. I can read it over and over again. I just love the story, the characters, the history, everything!Undoubtly the best book ever written....",
            "romance, history, tears... the book is a master piece... if the ending gave me more, i would have jumped with joy but... still it is a really good book... teaches you from the perspective of the south and even makes you feel so sorry for scarlet... i never really liked rhett because he just didn't seem like he loved her.. i guess he sort of didn't.. well it was wonderful^^",
            "I read this book the first time when I was 14, after the re-release of the movie. I saw that the book had been re-released on a visit to the library, and checked it out. Well, a casual reader cannot read \"Gone with the Wind\" in the one week the library gives you for new books, so I bought this copy from Amazon, and took it with me on a 10 day vacation. Almost done reading it. Think I will read \"Scarlet\" next.",
            "It's a good story. And the typing is perfect, clear, and the language is totally understandable. It seems like I am right there listening, learning, and getting a full understanding of what is going on. It's wonderful. I haven't been able to finish it because of shakespeare reading, but I am rushing through William to get to Margret. Good writing. And a wonderful classic read.",
            "Wow, the civil war from the southern POV, who knew? Yes, racism is rampant, but I loathe history and I loved this book.",
            "I absolutely LOVED the book! I never would have read the book, but I read a review somewhere that someone said don't wait until you're 50 years old like her to read the book. It was very easy to read and I enjoyed the author's writing style. Even though the book was Fiction, Mitchell wrote it with realistic and actual events of the pre/post Civil War. I had a great and better understanding of why the Southerners thought the way they did about the Yankees and continue to grasp their love for their land, values, and ideals of the Old South even to this day.I had seen the movie, \"Gone with the Wind\" a few years back but didn't get a true appreciation of it of why it was such a great movie, and after reading the book, I purchased the DVD. Having read the book, it was easy to follow and understand the movie which doesn't always capture the true essence of the book.I am on a pursuit of reading classic novels and this was on my list. Take the time to read this book...it is quite large so it will take some time to read but is well worth it.",
            "This wonderful book deserves 10 stars at least. I just re-read it and, even now 30 years after I first read it, it still stands head and shoulders above any other work of fiction I've ever read.There is good reason why GWTW remains so enduringly popular. First of all is Margaret Mitchell's wonderful verbosity; this allows her to describe the physical setting in lush detail and to create characters of enduring interest and complexity. When it comes to characterization, no author I've ever read can even touch Margaret Mitchell's skill.But what also makes GWTW so enduring popular is its readability. Except for Scarlett's occasional \"Fiddle-dee-dee\" and \"God's nightgown!\" and the almost unintelligible dialogue of the blacks, Gone With the Wind reads like something written by a modern day author. The language is simple and direct and forthright, never complex or flowery. This gives the book a timelessness and makes it, even at 900+ pages, an amazingly fast read.Although reading GWTW this time as a middle-aged adult I found it far more tragic and sad and far less romantic, what I appreciated more about it was the background story and the way the author worked it seamlessly into her narrative. She vividly describes the effects of the war and Reconstruction on Southern society in a way that is evocative without ever sounding bitter or angry.If you've never read GWTW then you owe it to yourself to do so immediately if not sooner! Trust me, you'll never be sorry that you did. The characters of Rhett, Scarlett, Ashley and Melanie will become like real people who will live on in your mind forever.",
            "In time for the Diamond Anniversary of the publication of this formidable American classic, as well as the 150th anniversary of the Civil War that it depicts, I present my editorial musings about Margaret Mitchell's iconic literary piece.As an African American, it was a touchy and sometimes uncomfortable read for me. But as a child of Barbadians, my ancestors had been free for roughly 30 years by the time the story begins, and as subjects of the British Crown, had the option of attending British Universities, whereas America was on the verge of its most catastrophic war, in which slavery was a major issue, and Jim Crow laws would succeed slavery, I can and did read this novel with a little more detachment than most African Americans could.It took me 17 days to complete it, my eyes flowing faciley over the pages of the Avon Book rendition.Margaret Mitchell introduces her heroine, Katie Scarlett O'Hara, a willful green-eyed beauty of Franco-Irish descent, on an April day in 1861, where the 16-year-old is entertaining two suitors, the Tarleton Twins, on the front porch of her family's Georgia plantation, Tara.The lanky handsome red-haired Tarleton Twins, Stuart, and Brent, had been expelled from college,but were planning to join the Confederate Army, and they begin to aggravate their coquettish young hostess with their frequent talk of war. Scarlett threatens to go inside and lock herself away if they fail to change the topic of conversation, and is obliged. In due time, of course, the young Southern Belle would have to shed her preconceived notions about war as a gender-segregated issue, and accept it as everyone's business, regardless of gender.In the meantime, the topic turns to the upcoming barbecue at the neighboring Wilkes plantation, Twelve Oaks, where the handsome, blond Ashley Wilkes, whom Scarlet desires above all others, resides with his widowered father, John, and sisters, India and Honey. She learns Ashley will marry his cousin, Melanie Hamilton, who is sweet, delicate, and of a milder mold than she, who despises her.Literally turning into something of a green-eyed monster, Scarlett schemes to steal Ashley from Melanie--a central plot in the story.Her firey Irish father, Gerald, discourages her pursuit of Ashley, knowing such a union would be an unhappy one. Like most of the men closest to Scarlett, he had her best interest at heart.Her mother, Ellen Robillard O'Hara, from a notable French family from Savannah, tends to the plantation, nursing the sick, settling the accounts of the estate, and spending ample time delivering and baptizing the out-of-wedlock children of the impoverished Emmie Slattery, who are fathered by the O'Hara's Yankee overseer, Jonas Wikerson.Although better educated that the lowly Slatteries, his profession bars him from association with Georgia's upper echelon. So he turns to the lowly Slattereys for companionship.Ellen asks her husband to fire Wilkerson for his immorality, but Gerald refuses.Ellen appears too busy to really notice her oldest daughter's intrigues.The evening ritual of family prayers provides some temporary solace for Scarlett, who has quarreled with younger sisters Careen (baptized Caroline Irene) and Sue Ellen(baptized Susan Elinor). Servants Mammy, Pork, Dilcey, and Prissy stand guard as Ellen leads the family in Roman Catholic breviaries.Mammy knows Scarlett best, and calls her out as her charges prepares to attend the barbecue, but Scarlett has ways of manipulating Mammy to get her way.At the barbecue, Scarlett shines. In due time, it is revealed that all the men who will play a pivotal role in her life are there. She gathers her suitors under a tree, flushed and flirtatious.In the meantime, a mysterious man from Charleston with a murky reputation has his eye on the raven-haired beauty. As Scarlett is winning men's hearts, this man, Rhett Butler, earns the ire of the same men by giving them a realistic account of their chances of defeating the Yankees, as he has visited Northern factories, and areas of that region many of John Wilkes' guests had not.Gradually, it will be seen that Rhett Butler is right, and most of the men quarreling with him are dead.Slipping away from the rooms where the young ladies are napping, Scarlett confronts Ashley in the library to reveal her feelings, and is gently rebuffed. In a tearful rage, she slaps the man she claims to love and throws a china bowl decorated with roses, smashing it, and startling Rhett, who had been sleeping on the couch, initially out of her sight. Her response to his remarks about her behavior reveal her to be unsure of her own mind where Ashley is concerned.Amid Scarlett's dealing with the hurtful sniping of other young ladies, the word gets out that recruits are called for and all eligible men, including Ashley, rush off to enlist.A moment of desperate jealousy towards Ashley and Melanie leads Scarlett into an ill-conceived union with Melanie's brother, Charles--the day before Ashley and Melanie's marriage--. Charles dies of illness while at war, leaving Scarlett widowed and pregnant with their son, Wade, with whom, like many parents in wartime, Scarlett will have difficulty bonding.During a visit with her Aunt Pittypat, the widow scandalizes Atlanta by dancing with blockade runner Rhett at a ball benefitting the troops, while clad in widow's weeds.The story follows the young beauty through nursing soldiers with Dr. Meade and a pregnant Melanie, her frustration with Prissy during Melanie's labor(Prissy's simplemindedness was most likely a ruse as it was for most slaves), and her perilous flight back to Tara from Atlanta despite bad weather and battles, during which Rhett journeys with her only part of the way before rushing off to enlist.With Melanie, Wade, Prissy and newborn Beau in tow, she returns to find Tara still standing, unlike Twelve Oaks, although blighted by soldier's lootings, Mammy, Pork, and Dilcey about the only remaining servants, her sisters ailing, her father non compos mentos, and her mother dead of typhoid fever contracted from nursing Emmie Slattery.Finding only rotten produce to eat, she vows to rebuild her life by any means necessary, and as the saying goes, \"There is nothing angrier than an educated Southern lady.\"Using all her cunning, education,and inner strength unleashed by harsh circumstances, she acheives her goal at the expense of many friendships, marrying twice more, bearing daughters Ella(by Frank Kennedy, the \"old maid in britches\" she steals from sister, Sue Ellen when she realizes his business can help pay the taxes on Tara) and Bonnie(by Rhett) along the way--the last of whose strong will matches her mother's, leading to grave consequences.In a very poignant ending, Scarlett does come to appreciate how much Melanie really means to her, seeing how her kindness and fortitude complemented and buttressed her own grit and determination, and she finally sees Ashley as a hopeless and perpetual dreamer in view of her own willingness to face and deal with life's realities head-on.Intriguing characters include the amputee soldier, Will Benteen,and the crude Hillbilly, Archie, whose history proves the practice of Honor Death was not confined to Mid-Eastern culture. Both show how the war brought disparate social groups together, as does Madame Belle Watling.The political incorrectness, mysogyny, and racism may ruffle a few feathers. But it is appreciated that these people were products of their time, although impressively, Scarlett's mother forbade her to use the \"N\" word.Still, this story is an American epic that reflects the resilience of a human spirit that never conceded defeat.I recall that during a televised airing of the film version of this epic in the early 1980s, the announcer referred to Scarlett as \"The Jewel of Tara\", and indeed, in facing life's great calamities, she does prove to be \"Diamond hard\".",
            "\"Burdens are for shoulders strong enough to carry them\"Tara Plantation, near Jonesborough, near Atlanta, GeorgiaKatie \"Scarlett\" O'Hara is the most charming Southern belle, gathering the attention of beaux all over the surrounding areas. But when she learns the man she had been psuedo-courting, Ashley Wilkes, is marrying Melanie Hamilton from Atlanta, his cousin, she schemes to win him back. When he refuses, she immediately marries Charles Hamilton in spite. But Civil War has come to the South, and Scarlett quickly finds herself a widow, stuck in Atlanta, with a child, unable to be the pretty belle she had been a few months prior. Will Scarlett ever get Ashley? What about the strange Rhett Butler character, who is constantly tweaking her? Will Scarlett and her family survive the war?Let me preface my review with this: I don't read a lot of historical fiction or chick lit or romance or anything. My speciality is science fiction, fantasy, and urban fantasy. However, this book absolutely, positively blew me away!At first, I found the novel a bit slow. There were so many characters, and at first, it seemed like nothing happened. But that wasn't to last. Quickly, I became interested in Scarlett's schemes to snatch Ashley away from Melanie, all the while hating her for her bad behavior. By the end of the book, there were points were I was in near tears.Scarlett wasn't my favorite character. She was a rude, bitter, selfish woman. But I completely understood her predicament. To the reader, she was completely honest, despising her first husband's death (and life!), her dislike of children (don't see that much in romance do we!), her dislike of women's poor station (always having to act \"silly\" in front of the menfolk), and taking the reigns of business to make a life of her own. So while I didn't like her, I also didn't hate her. I understood what she was trying to do and found myself rooting for her against the odds. She is a brilliantly written character, so dynamic, multifaceted and full.Melanie Hamilton was probably my favorite character. This might seem odd as she does come off as a Mary Sue--perfect and sweet to everyone, always right, yada, yada--and I hate Mary Sues. But I really never found Melanie a Mary Sue. Scarlett repeatedly downplays Melanie's beauty. Melanie is strong-willed and works diligently, but tires easily (such as when she works at Tara in the cotton fields). Like Scarlett, Melanie was definitely not a 1-D character. She appeared weak on the outside, while maintaining strenght in the face of danger, in the face of childbirth, in the face of hard times. She was a true inspiration to me.Rhett Butler made me so furious, sometimes I wanted to slap him like Scarlett! But other times, he was so charming and debonair, that I wanted to melt in his arms like butter. I loved how forthright he was, how practical and realistic he was, and yet how at times, his passionate nature came through (joining the Confederate army at the end, for example).Side characters, such as Miss Pittypat, Mammy, Dilcey, Pork, Uncle Peter, Mrs. Meade, Belle Watling, and more, jumped out at me. They felt like real people, people influenced by dreams, desires, and feelings. Probably one of the sweetest moments was when Dr. and Mrs. Meade were talking and she mentioned she would rather him be at Belle's than dead. Given what Mrs. Meade had been through, what she held dear, it was particularly poignant.I could go on endlessly about the amazing life lessons and themes and symbols in the book. Quotes about the status of women at the time, about changing with the changing times, about strength of character, about being who you are, and about what is really important in life abound in this book. Most of the ones that really touched me may be found on my profile page, though the whole book is brimming with it.As this deals with the South during the Civil War, there is much talk of slavery; one of the reasons, I believe, it has been so frequently placed on the Banned Books list. Some people believe that it shows slavery in a favorable light, that blacks were/are children that need to be tended by whites. My opinion is this: it shows how many white Southern plantation owners viewed slaves. Not all slave owners were Mr. Simon Legree of Uncle Tom's Cabin. Conversely, not all slave owners are like the O'Hara's. Yes, there are a lot of black stereotypes (Mammy, Prissy, etc.), but this is a snapshot into the past. You can't take this book and try to force modern views of civil rights and racism into it. However, I do believe it makes a brilliant discussion piece: comparing Scarlett and other Southern whites' views of blacks with other accounts (such as Uncle Tom's Cabin or the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn).All in all, this is a brilliant book, made more excellent by the narrator, who deftly interprets the Southern dialect and accents for the listener. I thoroughly enjoyed it and was heart-broken, but inspired, when it ended. I highly recommend, even to those, like me, who aren't big into historical fiction.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*",

            "If you think this is chick lit, think again. Its thousand pages are so insightful a portrait, almost an expos&eacute;, of Cavalier society that I wonder at the book's popularity in the old Confederacy. It also sustains the lovely device of delivering the author's commentary through a pair of reverse-image channels, Ashley Wilkes and Rhett Butler, twins in their perceptions of the South but opposites in appearance and manner. The amazingly shallow Scarlett O'Hara carries on without quite noticing Ashley's and Rhett's joint narrative, flattering the reader's ability to see what she doesn't.Mitchell's portrayal of the races is as offensive as reality, which is saying a lot. Since we would rather that things had not been so and as we try to make them better it's useful having a baseline document like this, even though it can't properly imagine black slavery from the inside.About the last third of this long book changes tone as the author seems unable to maintain the same novelistic approach to Reconstruction as she did to the war. Mitchell's outrage boils over and the prose becomes somewhat expository.One cannot help being impressed by the continuation of that outrage for so many decades past the 1860s and 1870s. It prompts curiosity to learn more. Remember that Abraham Lincoln broke with the Republican Party late in his first term over post-war policy toward the South. As the GOP became the party of the Army (which it remains) it adopted a hard line that Lincoln rejected. Instead, Lincoln chose a southern (but anti-secessionist) Democrat as his running mate in 1864 under a \"National Union Party\" banner.What would it have meant, to blacks and whites, if Lincoln had been able to impose his own post-war policy? (And has any American ever faced decisions as awesome and consequential as did Abraham Lincoln?)Yet for all the book's historical and social interest in the end you can't around its marvelous sequence of set-pieces. Consider: Scarlett the pampered 19-year-old driving a dying mule and buckboard through the night and the following day amid the terrors of war with the lives of Melanie and her new-born constantly in the balance, only to emerge into her childhood world made desolate, her neighbors burnt out of their homes, her mother dead and her father helpless, her sisters ghostly from disease, broken soldiers roaming the land, and nothing to eat anywhere. How many of us can even grasp the idea of famine in an isolated rural area? Goodness gracious!Gone with the Wind leaves many images that will endure.",
            "It's no wonder this is the second most sold book in history. The movie just doesn't do the book justice; the book really puts you in the south during the Civil War. Great read!",
            "It took me until age 35 to read this book. So glad I did! I read it over a two month span and was so sorry to reach the end.",
            "Truly a classic by Margaret Mitchell. This was one book I read and loved since high school days, and that was forty plus years ago. The literary style with its vivid descriptions is excellent - the unforgettable civil war of the late 1800's,the rebuilding of the beautiful Tara estate, and of course the emotional stirrings and passion of both Scarlet O' Hara and Rhett Butler. All these and more bring us back to the good old days and the lessons that we have learned to value through the times.",
            "BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ. I ORDERED FOR MY KINDLE AND I HAVE IN PAPERBACK. BUY AND ENJOY SCARLETT AND RHETT",
            "This is my second time reading Gone With the Wind (I read it once in high school) and it didn't disappoint the second time around. In fact, I think I love it even more now, with a little life experience under my belt. Just a pleasure to read.",
            "This is a rich, breathtaking classic that can (and should) be read over and over again. It is a long, long story spanning twelve eventful years, but it is definitely worth the time it takes to read. The book is like an epic - Margaret Mitchell's voice is powerful, poetic, wise. Characters are the most important element of a book for me, and this book has the most beautiful, complex, unique characters I have ever encountered in a work of fiction. Scarlett never ceases to amaze me - her resourcefulness and ambition are incredible for a woman of her time. It is incredible how tragedy transforms her - from flighty and carefree to a harsh, driven woman whose compelling desire is to return to the security and prosperity before the war. She is also a frustrating protagonist in her narrow-minded stubbornness and inability to understand others and her own heart. Rhett Butler is the other character in this novel that captivates me. Readers will love his subtle sarcasm, sharp wit, and suave mannerisms. It's impossible not to! He is the quintessential \"bad boy\" that countless authors have tried to recreate. But he runs deep too, especially in his love for Scarlett and sentimentality for the charm of the Old South.The historical fiction aspect of the novel is extraordinary as well. I fell in love with the deep South as Mitchell described it, even though I have no connection to that part of America. I never considered the plight of Southerners during and after the Civil War, but this book revealed its devastating effect on the people and customs of the South. Books about the destruction of a society rarely end happily. But it surprised and disheartened me when the author paralleled Scarlett and Rhett's love story with the downfall of the South.",
            "I loved Gone with the Wind.. The time period was a crucial time for shaping America as we now know it. So many things stand out in my mind from the book but the one that I see the most is the relationship between Scarlett and Rhett. I think we know he loves her from the moment on the stairs at Twelve Oaks.. Scarlett to me seems like our modern day power hungry woman.. going against tradition in a mans world and proving a woman can survive..however she did marry Mr. Kennedy..but he was just a means to an end.. nothing more to her but a way to get what she wanted.. Then again like many modern day women her children were not anyone she really cared to be around and left them in the care of others while she worked hard to get the money she so wanted.. I think Scarlett always loved Rhett and did not know it till the end and when she found out she saw that she finally had all the money she could need but she did not have the one thing that could truley make her happy.. LOVE.. The story left me a little sad because of all that the people went through during those years of war and reconstruction.. but with those changing times we saw the freedom that so many deserved and the way of life of the South forever changed (regardless of those who can not seem to except that after all these years) I myself am a southerner and I can say that there were many things about the old south that seem magical..but so many others that were just plain wrong. Gone with the Wind shows so much of the Old South and of all the characters I think Mammy was the strongest and smartest of them all.. She was a woman that could tell you right from wrong in a world that you thought you knew everything and she stood by her \"family\" through more than blood kin would have.. Gone with the Wind is a must have on any book shelf.",
            "This is my all time favorite. My Nana lived five houses away from MM in Ansley Park, an Atlanta suburb. She pointed out the house many times, she must have thought I wasn't listening. Nana, a staunch Presbyterian finally broke down and read the book, considered somewhat scandalous. (my mother said that Nana disappeared for days until she finished it...and did like it) Margaret was a bit ahead of her time...wanting to be a journalist, to work where only men were permitted. Finally, just to get her off their back...The Atlanta Constitution hired her to cover the homicide division. She flourished.She married Red, then divorced him but they would \"meet up\" from time to time. Apparently there was ample chemistry. She fashioned Rhett Butler after her handsome rogue of a husband so much so that MGM required Margaret to get a release from him fearing some kind of lawsuit. He signed it gladly, happy for the likeness.I first read the book at age 16 and have since read it five more times. The research for its historical accuracy, the language, the complex characters, the rich texture of the tale and then the FABULOUS ending! Still impressive. Pulitzer Prize, movie, MM's only book, has moved me in a different way each time I sit down with it.",
            "Absolutely fantasic. This book was so good, even though I couldn`t stand Scarlett most of the time. All the different characters were ejoyable to read, and Rhett`s character had so many different layers that I was always trying to figure out just how much he cared for the unworthy Scarlett. READ THIS BOOK.",
            "Only on page 328, but I am already obsessed! I have received little support in reading this novel. In fact, when I tell people I am reading GWTW each person has replied, \"Oh wow. I've never read it but I saw the movie. Such a great love story.\"To be honest I find myself annoyed! I could never imagine a movie that could substitute this book. And, yes, a love story, but just as well a historical narrative of the grueling life during the civil war through the mind of Scarlet. This leaves me to wonder how could a movie encompass the pages and pages of her thoughts? I am almost too afraid to see the movie for fear it will not live up to my expectations.Anywho... Amazing novel thus far. I highly recommend to those age 12+. In fact, my 16 year old, second cousin recommended it! I'm so proud of her!Best,Kim",
            "I am a native Georgian, and I cannot believe I waited so long to read Gone With the Wind. Pat Conroy's new introduction finally got me to pick it up, and it simply is one of the best books I have ever read. It is magnificent. Winner of the Pulitzer Prize, it is a snapshot of a conquered nation and people - right here in the United States - and how they survive and persevere in the face of changing times, a lost war, and overwhelming odds.If your only exposure to Gone With the Wind is the film, you have so much more to discover. There are many important differences between the book and the film. ***SPOILER ALERT*** The book has many colorful characters sacrificed for the movie - Will Benteen, a Confederate Veteran who ends up running Tara and marrying one of Scarlett's sisters, Mrs. Tarleton (mother of the twins), Honey Wilkes (Ashley's sister), Uncle Henry Hamilton (Melanie and Charles' uncle), Dilcey (wife of Pork), and the much more fleshed out Aunt Pittypat and Belle Watling, just to name a few. In the book Scarlett has three children, one by each of her three husbands, instead of just Bonnie as portrayed in the film. Another major difference between the book and the film is that Rhett's motivations, background, and depth of feeling (and incredible suffering) comes through in the book in much more detail. In addition, by the end of the book I had a great affection for the quiet forgiveness, intelligence and iron-clad strength of Melanie that I felt was a bit lost in the film. Melanie truly is one of literature's greatest \"steel magnolias.\" ***END OF SPOILERS***I was very interested to read of Gone With the Wind's popularity overseas. It has been reported that the book has been translated into 40 foreign languages in 50 countries. It is amazingly popular in Japan, and in Germany more than 360,000 copies were sold by July 1941. I had never thought about it before, but Gone With the Wind was written during the late 1920's and 1930's about survival in the American south during and after the Civil War, at the same time Germany was suffering and rebuilding from its defeat in World War I. The European resistance movement during World War II found so much inspiration in the south's reaction to the Federal occupation in Gone With the Wind that the book was bootlegged during the war by the French Underground and other organizations. Orders actually went out from Germany at one point during World War II to \"seize all copies.\"During and after World War II people in rebuilding countries took the story of Gone With the Wind to heart. Margaret Mitchell stated, \"In practically every European country critics wrote at length of the 'universal historical significance.' Each nation applied to its own past history the story of the Confederate rise and fall and reconstruction. French critics spoke of 1870 (the Franco-Prussian War), Poles of the partitioning of their country, Germany of 1918 and the bitterness which followed, Czechs wrote not only of their troubled past but of their fears of the future, and I had letters from that country just before it went under (Nazi domination), saying that if the people of the South had risen again to freedom the people of Czechoslovakia could do likewise.\"The worldwide legacy of Gone With the Wind is truly astounding, and it all began right here in the Atlanta area with this book. Do not be put off by the book's size. Gone With the Wind is a real barn burner, and there is not a dull moment in the entire story. It is dramatic, brutal, romantic, amazingly intelligent, and quite shocking even by today's standards. The pages literally fly by. Read the first two chapters and if you are like me you will not be able to put it down. Margaret Mitchell's storytelling ability is an amazing thing to behold.Very highly recommended.",
            "This was my first read of \"Gone with the Wind\" and have to say it is by far some of the most vivid visual writing style I've encountered. The period style of writing and language used to describe scenery, events, people, class, style, emotions and action are simply riviting.Simply put: read the book.",
            "This was my first time reading this classic and I really didn't know what to expect. I had seen the movie version several times and in my opinion I really enjoyed the book so much more (Although the movie earns it's own merit's). It left me speechless and it really made me think about what Scarlett O'Hara had been through and it really made me for feel her and the other characters in the story. I was really impressed with the story Margaret Mitchell created. I can see why this got the Pulitzer Prize in 1937. If this has to be the book you choose for your next read, make it this one for sure!",
            "I read this book about 20 years ago, I am so glad I read again! Scarlett was ahead of her time and a very strong woman. Follow this book with the new Rhett Butler's People which I found very interesting.",
            "This is a new copy of an old favorite that I read to death. Have not read this one yet, but, I am sure that I will enjoy it as much as the other one.",
            "What a masterpiece! Enjoyed every chapter. Details in the book most interesting that were left out of the movie. Margaret Mitchell was a genius.",
            "I knew this book was a classic so I figured I would like the book. I didn't like it, I loved it. It took me three weeks to read but I still couldn't put it down. It kept me hooked to the end. I didn't know what to expect but it is a classic. Scarlett was a woman that was becoming modern but people and the times did not want it. I love her for what she did in the book and stood up for herself. The movie is as just as good as the book.",
            "This is a review YEARS in the making. First, I saw the movie on TV - bought the DVD and watch it at least once a year. Whenever I think of GWTW, I visualize Scarlett and her father at the oak tree at sunset...as the music swells. I enjoyed the story of a strong woman who truly believes that she is only trying to do her best for her family. Now. I said all that, to say this: the movie is nothing compared to the book! The book fleshes out the characters, life in the deep south, and the civil war. The book is long,yes, but there are no gratuitous descriptors - every word adds to your understanding of the people, the time, and the politics. After having the movie 'in my head' for so many years, believing that it was the story - I was delighted to find so much more in the book. I now read the book about once a year. This book is a must read for anyone whoever saw the movie; and for anyone looking for a real novel!",
            "Great condition. I am really enjoying it. Can't believe it took me 68 years to finally read this.",
            "It was a very loooong book but really good! Usually with long books there's always a part that drags on forever but it never felt that way with this book. It always kept my interest and the ending was different and not at all what I expected, which is a good thing.",
            "...into the ad hoc matriarch of a shattered plantation family. Scarlett O'Hara makes you wince at her infuriating shallowness earlier in the story. You can spot it in a conversation between herself and Ashley Wilkes, the man she wants to steal away from Melanie Hamilton. Ashley comments that Rhett Butler (who Scarlett has just seen for the first time) looks like one of the Borgias. Scarlett asks which family they are--she doesn't know them. Ashley patiently explains that they're Italians. \"Oh,\" says Scarlett dismissively. \"Foreigners.\" The type of prideful ignorance that my own working class demographic (\"crackers\" back in those days) expresses like this; \"I'm dumb as hell and proud of it.\" One thing the movie doesn't capture by a long shot with Vivien Leigh as Scarlett and Olivia DeHavilland as Melanie is that these girls are teenagers, antebellum \"valley girls\". So actually, what do you expect? Basically, Melanie beats Scarlett out for Ashley's affections becase she is nowhere near as immature. But Scarlett's father frequently comments on her \"willfulness\", possibly without realizing himself that it's a clue to a titanic courage in his firstborn. In the ensuing story, the Civil War grinds up people and land. Melanie, Scarlett's onetime despised rival, becomes dependent upon her. Ashley is destroyed in spirit as well--a rich dandy doesn't have the moxie to endure war when it lands in his backyard. The main reason Scarlett ends up getting involved with Rhett is that he's the only man with her level of guts. Scarlett reminds me of Pat Conroy's \"Great Santini\" character--at first you can't stand her, you thank God no one like her is close to you, but when the chips are down, she's a survivor. And people associated with her survive as well. One thing this book points out is that the ugliness of war is a force of human nature, and people who think themselves insulated from it, or \"above war's barbarism\" wind up finding out the hard way that they're dead wrong. Now if only our present-day sheltered middle class and \"thinking people\" could face that inescapable truth...",
            "This vivid tale of the Civil War and Reconstruction is not idealism (as reviews calling it racist imply) but realism. The rich characterizations and deep plot reveal its author to be one of profound understanding, not only of human nature and of life itself, but also of the forgotten, overlooked, untaught aspects of war and racial strife.Observe the polemics of those who call it racist. I dare say that that charge would be made by the same people of any book using any approbrious terminology whatever, regardless of the context.Also, as you read the negative reviews, notice the consistent lack of specifics of those who doubt its historical validity. There will not be one single example. This is part of their method of deterence, and they have nothing but hollow, unsupported invective. Anyone who needs clarification is welcome to email me.I am a constant reader, and I found Gone With the Wind not only sublime in its narrative and poetic in its dialogue, but an excellent adventure into the &quot;house of cards&quot; that was the lives of the Southern aristocracy.",
            "Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler are classic charecters along with the rest of them. They're as classic as the story. So much history is in the book. It gives a clear and good picture of how it was during that time. Everything isn't perfect. I'm 11 years old. That may seem too young to understand such a classic love story but I did. It was even better than other love stories like Wuthering Heights or Jane Eyre. Not to say they aren't classics. Ms. Mitchell writes the story clearly and comes straight to the point unlike for instance Henry James who takes up 2 pages to describe a woman's dress. If you read one love story in your life or watch one movie make it Gone with the Wind.",
            "As with all great classics, I am hard-pressed to say anything original about Gone With the Wind. This is my second reading and I still love the book. If you have seen the movie, but have not read the book, read the book. There is a great deal more that will only add to your enjoyment of the storyline.Some things I did not know about Margaret Mitchell made re-reading the book all the more interesting (thank you Wikipedia). Mitchell's maternal great-grandfather was from Ireland and settled on a slaveholding plantation in Georgia. Her grandfather fought in the Civil War and made a lot of money in the lumber business after the war (just like Scarlett!). As a young girl, Mitchell heard a lot of Civil War stories from her relatives and visited the ruined plantations in Georgia. And, most interesting to me was that her mother was a women's rights activist.I think these points are important because they give you a better understanding of the characters in GWTW. And I think the most interesting point is Mitchell's portrayal of Scarlett as a shrewd and independent businesswoman during a time when no women ran businesses or even played a role in commerce, except maybe in selling pies like Mrs. Merriwether and taking in sewing and boarders like Mrs. Elsing. (Or Belle Watling's business. Belle's character is also quite modern, profession aside.) Mitchell also portrays Ellen, Scarlett's mother, as the true head of the plantation, with Gerald as a figurehead.Although I love this book, it is difficult to read the sections about slavery and the slaves on the O'Hara plantation. The O'Haras take pride in their kind treatment of their slaves, yet the O'Haras and other plantation owners come off as very condescending. And who knows whether kind treatment was common on all southern plantations. It's a bad part of American history and all accounts of this time-period make you cringe. But I think it's important to note that some of Mitchell's slave characters (Mammy, Pork, Uncle Peter) are smarter and wiser than their owners.I think Mitchell's description of the post-war period is very good and it shows what a mess Atlanta was and how the Southern way of life known and loved by its people was forever lost. I like how the characters, particularly Melanie and her followers cling to their committees and old customs, even when the Northerners take over the city.There are certainly many, many other points to add about the characters and the book, Melanie's goodness, Ashley's displacement in the new South, and Scarlett's inability to understand and appreciate the people around her until it is too late.I like Rhett Butler the best. He is very modern, thinking it ridiculous never to mention pregnancy and birth control. He loves children and these things make him even more appealing. You want to forget how he makes his money, his drinking and what he does over at Belle's house because he is so likeable and smooth. His flirtatious conversations with Scarlett are so fun to read, but my favorite parts are when Rhett shows his true feelings to Melanie, and sadly to Scarlett at the end.",
            "Simply put, Gone With The Wind is a masterpiece of epic proportions. It doesn't get any better than this. The movie by comparison is an utter waste of time. I have read Gone With The Wind over and over again and it never gets old. I couldn't recommend a book more.",
            "I never saw the classic movie Gone With the Wind until I was in my late teens. But I had read the book. Of course I'd heard of the movie, and I had a vague idea that it was a romance tale set during the Civil War. But something drew me to it. Perhaps I picked up that it was an epic tale, or something similar.Anyway, one day while walking through a book store while in my early teens, I decided it was time I learned what all the fuss was about. Being a guy, I didn't expect to find much to like, but I figured I give the novel a chance.I'm glad I did.Yes, at its heart, Gone With the Wind is a romance story, though some might consider it a tragedy since (SPOILER ALERT) the romance dies in the end, but I loved the story.The characters were grand. The backdrop was ... well, it was epic, truth be told. The plotting was somewhat complex without being overly complicated. And it was pretty good writing.So why should I shun a novel just because it's romance? Because I'm a guy? That's silly.Especially considering, at least in my own opinion, this novel is so much more than just a romance. Believe me, as a form of education I've read a few romance novels. None of them come close to anything like Gone With the Wind.No bodice ripping here. There a scream or two from the heroine, but they're at appropriate times. And what a heroine! Scarlett O'hara is no wilting violet waiting for a man to save the day. No, she has no problems standing up for herself, maybe too much at times. In fact, Scarlett's hard-headedness is one of the character's tragic flaws within the novel.Okay, if you're one of those guy readers who thinks you could never pick up a romance novel, do yourself a favor and read Gone With the Wind. Though it's set in the American Civil War, you're not going to find page after page of descriptions of troop movements and battles and all that jazz. But you will find complex, interesting characters who are as real, as bold, and sometimes as weak as any found in the best literature of the world.",
            "This is the classic tale of wanting what you can't have ... until you can. Romance aside, this book is chock full of history, drama, suspense, emotional turmoil and philosophical whimsy. It's peppered with a dry, cynical wittiness that will keep you, not only turning pages, but smiling, laughing, and even occasionally gasping incredulously. Especially whenever the irresistible Rhett Butler enters a scene.The dialogue is simply smashing. The characters are realistic and resonate on a soul deep level. This is something that the movie version was, understandably, unable to pull off. Scarlett came across as a one dimensional, selfish, cold hearted monster on the big screen. In the book, however, we have behind the scenes access to her mind, heart, will and emotions. When this story is appreciated in literary form, one finds it difficult to either love or hate her entirely because, just as in reality, there are too many shades of gray.I have seen some people label this book as racist and intolerant. While I agree that there are some rather uncomfortable themes and an indisputable usage of inappropriate language, readers must bear in mind that this is a work of fiction depicting the culture and mind sets of characters living during the Civil War period. If the story had been written in any other way, it would have detracted from the authenticity of the tale. That being said, if you are sensitive to such things, you should probably steer clear.As far as I am concerned, this is a must read for any fan of historical fiction. Yet, I must warn you; Don't expect a happy or conclusive ending lest you be disappointed. After reading Forever Amber and many Anita Shreve books, I am always emotionally prepared for such a let down. Still, that didn't stop me from turning the last page of Gone With The Wind, anxiously looking for more. I was breathless with wonder, racked with unanswered questions, passionately angry at fate and, of course, torn between love and hate. When you really stop to think about it though, how could two personalities as dashingly quixotic as Scarlett and Rhett be expected to depart in any other fashion?",
            "I read GWTW one summer when I was a teenager, and got completely absorbed in it. I woke up one morning to the smell of bacon and stretched luxuriously in my bed as if I were Scarlett. Margaret Mitchell created a rich view of the antebellum south and characters that seemed real, making it easy for a reader to feel the horrors of the Civil War and empathize with the characters. Mitchell once said that Scarlett was a hussy, so I guess she was, but I never saw her that way. To me, she was a strong young woman who was forced out of her pampered world, determined to seize control of the future instead of cowering in a corner, even if it made her a social outcast.",
            "Margaret Mitchell wrote one of the most popular novels of all time. Set against the breath-taking backdrop of the red hills of Georgia during the American Civil War, Gone With the Wind is a window into a society that was swept away by war. Although I must say I doubt the portrayal of slavery is authentic in this work, every other aspect must be accurate. I have read some background information on Mitchell and, to my knowledge, she spent a significant amount of time researching every detail of her story--even down to the time of day that the list of deaths from the Battle of Gettysburg arrived in Atlanta.As a Southerner, I am proud of Mitchell's success and her novel. I would have to say that this is my favorite novel of all time--a great epic about the South and its storied past.However, as vast as the setting may be, it's easy to forget that there are two different plots going on: that of Georgia, and the South, during the Civil War, and that of Scarlett O'Hara and her struggle of hunger, poverty, love, and much more. The timing that Margaret Mitchell used in her novel (i.e. the death of Melanie, thus setting Ashley free; but at the same time realizing she, Scarlett, loved Rhett all along.) is amazing. However, the last part, Part V, moves a bit fast. But I suppose you can't dwell on 12 years worth of dialogue and narrative...I would recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys a historical novel. Although this book has been known since its publication as a romance, I would say that Gone With the Wind is anything but a modern romance--it is the epitome of what a romance SHOULD be.",
            "Gone With the Wind is one of those books that for years I've been telling myself I really should read, but other books just kept getting in the way. I finally decided pick it up, and couldn't put it down once I started it. It's such a wonderful story, and the ending is one of the best endings I've ever read in a book. The book is so much more than just a romance. I really wish Mitchell had written a sequel, because I would love to know what happens next to Scarlett (I know there are a few sequels out there by other authors, but to me that just isn't the same..I won't be reading them).One thing that was very hard for me to take was the extreme racism in the book. Of course, reading a book set in the South during slavery times and you know at least some of the characters will be racist. What surprised me though was how it is very apparent that Mitchell was very racist as well, and wasn't afraid to make her feelings about blacks and the South in general known. I really had to mentally block out some of Mitchell's attitudes in order to fully enjoy the book. At one point--around page 600, when Mitchell is describing the Restoration--I nearly had to set the book aside; it upset me so much. I'm glad I didn't though, because it is a great story, and one that will stay with me forever.",
            "Being a Yankee, I never got why so many white people in the South are STILL so bugged about the Civil War and its aftermath. Well, after reading this book, now I know: those ornery white people down there are descendents of Scarlett O'Hara and Melanie Wilkes (and all those tough old white ladies, the &quot;old cats,&quot; as Scarlett calls them) and by God they just ain't never gonna FORGET! Every American (especially all you Yankees) should read this book for a better understanding of the point of view of rich white Southerners during and after the Civil War. (You still won't think they were RIGHT, by the way, but you'll understand them.) Plus, Scarlett O'Hara is a total piece of work. You've gotta get a load of all the stuff she's up to! This is a chick who could rule the freakin' world!",
            "I am 16 years old and finished Gone With The Wind a few months ago. This is the most amazing story I have ever had the pleasure to lay my eyes upon. I have had an obsession with Gone With The Wind for quite some time and I read anything and everything I can about this novel and the film, my all time favorite movie. This is an amazingly captivating novel. Margaret Mitchell is perhaps the greatest author in American history. She is a literary goddess and her timeless characters have left a huge impression upon me. People say that the greatest tragedy in literary history is Romeo and Juliet...I think not! When I finished reading Gone With The Wind I realized that those people were wrong...when Rhett leaves Scarlett after all of her pleading and apologizing...it is undescribable in human terminology. Mitchell's amazing recount of the Civil War, the Old South, and the lives that were touched by both is unparalleled in the history of recorded language...I have become ! extremely interested in the history of the Old South and the greatest American crisis-the Civil War. This novel is by far a literary phenomenon...it will never be equalled or surpassed! I feel priveleged to have been able to read this book and I thank Ms. Mitchell for writing this paramount spectacle.",
            "&quot; Un-put-a-downable.&quot; When I started reading this book, I completely lost track of time. I became so hooked on the romance between Scarlett and Rhett, I just thought about it for days and days. I convinced my friends to read it, and they were addicted to it also. The film Gone with the Wind is superb, I imagine Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable perfectly as the two! The descriptions and wit in the novel is unsurpassed, by the end of the novel I felt like I knew Scarlett &quot; down the her bones&quot;. Very few books made me laugh aloud, gasp, sigh, and cry--this is one of them. Every time I pass the book on my shelf. I want to read it again. Once you get started..it's hell to stop. The sequel is pretty good, I just needed more of Rhett and Scarlett to keep thinking of. I wish terribly that Margaret Mitchell had written more for us to eternally cherish. Bless that woman!",

            "\"Burdens are for shoulders strong enough to carry them\"Tara Plantation, near Jonesborough, near Atlanta, GeorgiaKatie \"Scarlett\" O'Hara is the most charming Southern belle, gathering the attention of beaux all over the surrounding areas. But when she learns the man she had been psuedo-courting, Ashley Wilkes, is marrying Melanie Hamilton from Atlanta, his cousin, she schemes to win him back. When he refuses, she immediately marries Charles Hamilton in spite. But Civil War has come to the South, and Scarlett quickly finds herself a widow, stuck in Atlanta, with a child, unable to be the pretty belle she had been a few months prior. Will Scarlett ever get Ashley? What about the strange Rhett Butler character, who is constantly tweaking her? Will Scarlett and her family survive the war?Let me preface my review with this: I don't read a lot of historical fiction or chick lit or romance or anything. My speciality is science fiction, fantasy, and urban fantasy. However, this book absolutely, positively blew me away!At first, I found the novel a bit slow. There were so many characters, and at first, it seemed like nothing happened. But that wasn't to last. Quickly, I became interested in Scarlett's schemes to snatch Ashley away from Melanie, all the while hating her for her bad behavior. By the end of the book, there were points were I was in near tears.Scarlett wasn't my favorite character. She was a rude, bitter, selfish woman. But I completely understood her predicament. To the reader, she was completely honest, despising her first husband's death (and life!), her dislike of children (don't see that much in romance do we!), her dislike of women's poor station (always having to act \"silly\" in front of the menfolk), and taking the reigns of business to make a life of her own. So while I didn't like her, I also didn't hate her. I understood what she was trying to do and found myself rooting for her against the odds. She is a brilliantly written character, so dynamic, multifaceted and full.Melanie Hamilton was probably my favorite character. This might seem odd as she does come off as a Mary Sue--perfect and sweet to everyone, always right, yada, yada--and I hate Mary Sues. But I really never found Melanie a Mary Sue. Scarlett repeatedly downplays Melanie's beauty. Melanie is strong-willed and works diligently, but tires easily (such as when she works at Tara in the cotton fields). Like Scarlett, Melanie was definitely not a 1-D character. She appeared weak on the outside, while maintaining strenght in the face of danger, in the face of childbirth, in the face of hard times. She was a true inspiration to me.Rhett Butler made me so furious, sometimes I wanted to slap him like Scarlett! But other times, he was so charming and debonair, that I wanted to melt in his arms like butter. I loved how forthright he was, how practical and realistic he was, and yet how at times, his passionate nature came through (joining the Confederate army at the end, for example).Side characters, such as Miss Pittypat, Mammy, Dilcey, Pork, Uncle Peter, Mrs. Meade, Belle Watling, and more, jumped out at me. They felt like real people, people influenced by dreams, desires, and feelings. Probably one of the sweetest moments was when Dr. and Mrs. Meade were talking and she mentioned she would rather him be at Belle's than dead. Given what Mrs. Meade had been through, what she held dear, it was particularly poignant.I could go on endlessly about the amazing life lessons and themes and symbols in the book. Quotes about the status of women at the time, about changing with the changing times, about strength of character, about being who you are, and about what is really important in life abound in this book. Most of the ones that really touched me may be found on my profile page, though the whole book is brimming with it.As this deals with the South during the Civil War, there is much talk of slavery; one of the reasons, I believe, it has been so frequently placed on the Banned Books list. Some people believe that it shows slavery in a favorable light, that blacks were/are children that need to be tended by whites. My opinion is this: it shows how many white Southern plantation owners viewed slaves. Not all slave owners were Mr. Simon Legree of Uncle Tom's Cabin. Conversely, not all slave owners are like the O'Hara's. Yes, there are a lot of black stereotypes (Mammy, Prissy, etc.), but this is a snapshot into the past. You can't take this book and try to force modern views of civil rights and racism into it. However, I do believe it makes a brilliant discussion piece: comparing Scarlett and other Southern whites' views of blacks with other accounts (such as Uncle Tom's Cabin or the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn).All in all, this is a brilliant book, made more excellent by the narrator, who deftly interprets the Southern dialect and accents for the listener. I thoroughly enjoyed it and was heart-broken, but inspired, when it ended. I highly recommend, even to those, like me, who aren't big into historical fiction.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*",
            "This book was virtually transferring me back into time like a time machine..you live the book, you feel the book, you \"see\" the book..you are there..with Scarlett, Rhett, Mammy, Melanie, and Ashley..unbelievably emotional at all extremes..I love it and will be glad to re-read it.",
            "When I first picked up Gone with the Wind, it seemed impossibly large. However, halfway through the second page, I began noticing that the words were flying by, and my world was slowly grinding to a halt. Everything stopped so I could continue reading. The book was absolutely enthralling. The chemistry and romance between Rhett and Scarlett was so incredibly well written that I could see sparks flying out of their eyes, and here the firecrackers crackling as they traded insults. Even if they didnt know that they were perfect for eachother, we knew. After reading this book, I have come to the conclusion that, not only is Margaret Mitchell a phenomenal American writer, but she also is one of the best people to describe the South during and around the Civil War time period. She completely deserved the Pultizer Prize that she won, and I will continue to pass on the message about this amazing book. Such an archetypal novel should be timeless; it will never die out or become obsolete.",
            "well, ok, the cover looks like a romance novel and i wouldnt be caught dead without some kind of a dust jacket.it was very engaging and a fast read though its size can be daunting. with colorful discreptions, wonderful prose and excllient character development it is well worth the time it takes to finish it. it's one of the few books i would say is much better than the movie. you'll be glad you read it.",
            "Originally, I fell in love with the movie. The book is the same characters but weaves a deeper story rich in language, history and description. Mitchell's love of Atlanta and knowledge of the South makes this novel so inviting. Don't let the length be offsetting this book reads itself it flows so smoothly.",
            "I would give this 10 stars if I could. I haven't read this since I was a young girl in the early 70's and should never have waited so long to read it again. The characters were exceptionally well drawn, the dialogue was brilliant, particularly between Rhett (SIGH!) and Scarlett. I swear there was sparks flying off the pages. I am going to miss the people I will have to put behind me now that the book has come to an end, Rhett (SIGH), Scarlett, Mammy, Prissy and Aunt Pitty Pat (LOL).The author's use of prose was beautiful, all the scenes and action came alive for me. Some people seem to be offended by the racism in the book, but that's how things were back then. Sugar coating it would have ruined the story reducing it to a Harlequin romance.This is an incredibly well written book about the death of a civilization and the struggles to survive in the new era. This is a book that should not be missed, particulary those who enjoy historical fiction.",

            "Thsi is my absolute favorite book, I have read it at least 20 times! The first time in 2 days. The length is not important when you finish it you'll be wishing for another 2000 pages!",
            "The book takes some getting into, it doesn't really get interesting until the 200th page, but it's worht it! I would read it again and again. I'm only 14, and I loved this book!",

            "I first read Gone with the Wind in high school...now many years later (and many books later) it is still my favorite. I've read it five or six times. There is nothing like it. It's better than the movie and really packs an emotional punch. Just beautiful.",

            "The title says it all. Poor Scarlett. In her life, everything is just Gone with the Wind. Rhett. Her lifestyle. Melanie. The Confederacy. Her mother, Ellen. Her father, Gerald. Her first husband, Charles. Her second husband, Frank. Bonnie. The Tarleton twins. Cade. But through it all, she goes on. My favorite character was Melanie Hamilton Wilkes. She was so nice, loyal, trustworthy, loving, brave, courageous, funny, charming, polite, and Oh! so much more...My least favorite character was Rhett. \"That nasty varmint!\" as Scarlett said. I hated how Scarlett was so mean to Melanie, until it was too late. But no matter what scarlett did or said that was wrong, Melanie still loved her and stuck by her until the end, and even past then! I am also delighted that this story is told by the Confederate point if view. Atta girl, Mithcell!! A must for all Confederates, adults, children, everyone should read it!!!!!!!!",
            "I am only a teenager, but I have read this book cover to cover at least 5 times. It is absolutely amazing. It takes a very good book to make me cry, but by the end of Gone With the Wind, I'm bawling my eyes out. I'm in a bad mood for days every time I read it because of the ending. It makes me so frusterated. I never thought a book could do that. As soon as I found out there was a sequel, I went to the library and read it. It may not be as good as Gone With the Wind (but then, what is?) but it gives a plausible answer to this phenomenal saga of the south.",
            "After seeing the movie, I just had to read the novel. Although parts vary from what they are in the movie, it doesn't at all take away from the magic in Margaret Mitchell's words. I see Scarlett as someone I would want to be be. A woman who's strong, beautiful, and vain... and gets away with it. Rhett Butler is the epitimy of what a man should be. He's romantic and keeps you wondering what he's going to do next. All of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler's trials and happy moments are what makes Gone With the Wind the classic that it is. Mitchell's way of describing the brave (but horrible) downfall of the South is extrodinary. Anyone who loves romance, wit, and adventure should definitely read Gone With the Wind!",
            "This Book was elegeantly written.Itwas also throughly researched. Giving vivid details and a compelling love story. This is always going to be a american icon. if you were questioning whether or not to read the book read it and you will be undoubtfully satisfied",
            "This book took my breath away ... Margaret Mitchell has painted such an unforgettable character in Scarlett 'O'Hara that even after finishing the book ,u can't decide whether to despise her / admire her ... not once in the book ,does Scarlett think an unselfish thought -her motives are always totally selfish -either for herself / for Tara -her childhood home [ which in effect is because she loves it passioantely!} --- the way she twists men around her little finger even the worldly wise &amp; cynical Rhett Butler in the end --- the slow &amp; inevitable change from the coquettish &amp; beautiful 16 year old Southern Belle to the hard as nails &amp; embittered yet still beautiful woman --- her relationship with her angel-like sister-in-law whom she loves to hate but yet ultimately fails to --- her wild passion for Ashley that destroys her judgement where men are concerned &amp; nearly destroys her ---which when the mask finally falls is revealed as mere lust on his part &amp; infatuation on her part --- her unrecognised till its too late love for the charming yet crude Rhett --- Only Scarlett's self- absorption remains constant...! Margaret portrays all this so beautifully &amp; so vividly that u completely lose yourselves in the 'O 'Hara family &amp; their trials in the war ...&amp; Scarlett --- the girl with the world at her feet who goes through life refusing to be true to anyone but herself &amp; the woman she becomes so hardened by disillusionment &amp; poverty that she starts forgetting the feminine ways essential for a true lady in those times ... she lingers in your mind long after ...&amp; U can never really decide whether she got what she deserved/ deserved what she got...As a hugely popular classic ,it definitely lives up to its fame ...Certainly worth a read!",
            "This is the best book I have ever read in my entire life. It was excellent, nothing like I thought it would be. Very, very good.",
            "It was a very descriptive book, the costumes, the characters, the scenery, all came to life. A true romance, and not excessive love-making on every page. Rhett and Scarlett were truely meant for each other, but she didn't know it. It's so true.",
            "I read &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; when my friends were reading the sequel. It was definitely the best book I've read yet. I'm reading the sequel, &quot;Scarlett&quot; now and all the characters seem so real. I got angry at Rhett when he left Scarlett, I cried when Melanie died. If you've never read it, read it soon!",
            "and hope she loves as much as I do.I have read this story several times- so many that I have it commited to memory!I always had a copy of it with me until my last one feel apart from reading it to many times.!Scarlett is a strong woman, and in that time that strength was frowned upon by both men and women. I have - many times, drawn on the strength that she had through out the story.I hope that my daughter reads this when she is a teen and sees Scarlett for the modern woman that she is.",
            "Gone With the Wind is a beatifully written book that intrigued me from the very beginning! I had to read this book for an English class. My mom suggested it to me and I decided to make her happy I would start it, but I knew I'd never finish it- I mean 1,000 pages???? But, the first time I picked it up I read until page 70 and I would have kept reading, but it was late! It made me laugh, cry, and everything in between. I love how the book ends how it ends.(I can't tell you how!)I did read the sequel, and I have to say, it was OK, but not nearly as well written as Gone With the Wind. I would recommend this book to anyone who is in need of a good novel. Don't let the 1,000 pages intimidate you because when you read it, you'll forget there are that many pages, honest!!!!!",
            "Margaret Mitchell captures the essence of the Old South and skillfully interweaves that history with the travail of the civil war. She illustrates the high purposes for which the South fought the war and also demonstrates the utter futility of the Southern position and the senseless nature of most conflicts.",
            "IT IS ONE OF THE MOST UNFORGETTABLE STORY I HAVE EVER READ . IT IS ONE STORY THAT IS HARD TO RESIST AND STOP READING . WHO CAN EVER EVER FORGET THE FIERY CHARACTER OF SCARLETT O'HARA AND THE COOL , DASHING SOLDIER OF FORTUNE , RHETT BUTLER AND THEIR UNUSUAL DEVELOPMENT OF LOVE ?",
            "Before I picked up this book, I read most of the reviews, but I knew better than to let the opinions of others influence me tremendously. And so, I read through 1000 pages of war, Southern society/conventions in the antebellum and reconstruction South, and of course, the tempestuous romance between Scarlett and Rhett.I was expecting a romance, but I cannot classify GWTW as romance, but rather as historical fiction. Margaret Mitchell writes with a voice that captivates, evokes emotion, but most of all, she brings the Civil War and its aftermath to life especially through Scarlett O'Hara. The destitution, plights, burdens, and silly notions/convictions of Scarlett's reflect the people of the time; it gives readers a glimpse of failure, poverty, and the desperation war leaves in its trail. This is why I enjoyed this novel-the sentiments, struggles, and even the uncharitable thoughts going through Scarlett's head allowed me to feel empathy and to relate. The ignorance, grief, desperation, painful repercussions, and hope that circulate throughout novel are artfully portrayed.As to the romance, it wasn't what I was hoping for, but it was realistic. Honestly, I didn't like a single character in the novel because none of them knew the true meaning of love, and if they did, they didn't know how to express it. Scarlett is comparable to a spoiled, pampered child who lives eternally in her bubble even after all her hardships; she sees but does not grasp and doesn't have the will to do so. However, her strength and courage are to be commmended because despite her beliefs, she does not fail herself or others when it truly matters. Rhett is a complete idiot and their disastrous marriage is partly his fault because he never fought for his love...just like his blase skeptical outlook on people and life, he let it all slide by because what he hoped for didn't turn out to be reality. He used the wrong approach and so the ends did not meet as it should have, and how he hurt in the process. Mellanie was just too nice and naive to really be human; I find it almost unbelievable at times to see how much faith she had in everyone. Just as Scarlett's selfish, ill-conceived thoughts never ceased to amaze me, Mellanie's belief in man's better nature was as tedious. She is however the most likeable character. Ashley is weak, pitiful and as Scarlett realizes, the type of man girls dream about, but not worthy of their idolatry because the disillusionment is not worth it. Despite having a hard time liking any of the selfish or selfless and infinitely unworthy characters, I must admit that the characterization was dynamic. I really wanted to slap Scarlett, Mellanie, Rhett, and Ashley at some point or other. And at the same time, my heart went out to them because I could understand why they did the things they did.GWTW is an entertaining read, unique to its kind (just like The Fountainhead), but I didn't find it magnificent or glorious. The novel is as bitter as it is uplifting and I couldn't find a balance between the two. Just a lot of tolerance for silly, selfish, careless creatures and pity for those who reach the \"aha\" moment when it is too late. Because it's so well-written though, I know for sure that it is not a novel I am going to forget (which is often the case) and I am very glad I forced myself to read it. It was definitely an experience.",
            "This book was published in 1936; in the ensuing seventy years, no one has even come close to topping it. Enough said.",
            "This book is definitely worth the read. Although long, Gone with the Wind by Margaret Mitchell has a lot going on in it. Mitchell develops the characters so well that you can almost see them. It is also great for history. This is because I always learned about the civil war through the northerners eyes. In this book you see it all through the eyes of a southerner. As the story progresses you build up more and more grudges against Scarlet, who is not your best friend. Scarlet is rude and takes on too \"manly\" duties. Close to the end, though, she finally gets kicked back. When hard times hit she becomes more sweet, gentle and womanly. However, that does not last long enough. When her marital status changes she regains money and again, she gives up her sweetness and goes back to her old self. This book would be good for those who enjoy romantic, historical and classic novels about the civil war. Stick with it through the slow parts and you can easily enjoy the rest. If you have not read this yet, buy in now, it will not be like any other book you've ever read.",
            "I first read this book while in high school and I still love it 30 years later. It is also a great book for history of the civil war. It is an way for people not southerners to find out how the war was for the south.",
            "Selfish, sought after, sixteen-year-old Katie \"Scarlett\" O'Hara has everything a Southern Belle could want as the story begins in April of 1861: a loving family; a plethora of attentive suitors, and a lovely home on a plantation situated 25 miles from Atlanta, Georgia, maintained by the family's (p 279) hundred slaves. She soon learns that the primary object of her affections, Ashley Wilkes, is to about to announce his engagement. And before you know it, she has professed her love to one man, encountered another (Rhett Butler) for the first time, become engaged, married, pregnant and widowed. Meanwhile, most of the local males have become Confederate soldiers, battling on the side of the South in the Civil War. As the locals mourn their dead and the battles rage on, Scarlett chooses to return to Tara. After surviving a harrowing journey, she learns the fate of her family and home, and takes on roles of caregiver, operations manager, and manual laborer for the plantation along with its remaining inhabitants. She marries, again with ulterior motives, and moves to Atlanta, where her behavior as sole businesswoman starts tongues wagging. One wonders, will she ever find love?When the story ends, twelve years later, the war is over and many of her loved ones have passed. While she learns a few things about friendship, family, love, and loss, some things never change, like her feelings (contempt and disdain) about slaves and beliefs about slavery (better for them than their freedom). With its racist rhetoric, negative stereotypes, and inflammatory words for blacks (the \"n\" word alone appears ninety times), it is a lesson on the incomprehensible capacity of humans to justify their infliction of suffering on others and will likely cause many readers to squirm. But it is also a masterful epic on life and love in the South during the Civil War, with great character development and spectacular writing (including some neat old, odd words) which make it a worthy read from start to 700-plus page finish.",
            "Some of the reviews are long but I will keep this short. Gone With the Wind is the only book I have read twice. I absolutely adored this book and all the characters in it.

            "Perhaps it was Scarlett's unbreakable spirit as she tries to overcome her physical and mental struggles. Maybe it is the unreadabe and constantly fickle Rhett Butler. Or possibly it is the way the author describes the characters, the settings, and the events of this gripping novel in her own unique way. I really cannot specifically pinpoint why &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is my favorite book. All I know is that somehow it captivated me, and even now, a year after I first read it, I am still constantly thinking about it. The hard simplicity and honesty of the novel make it easy to love, and I imagine I will always cherish it.",

I am happy to report that the problem has been fixed, and that page 713 is now there!THis is a wonderful edition. The cover is beautiful, the pages neatly layed out, and a quite enjoyable book at that.Wonderful wonderful wonderful. Strongly recommend it!!",

            "GWTW is a classic, undoubtedly - sweeping, romantic, colorful, well written, all of that. I have read it so many times and seen the movie enough to recite it word for word, loved swashbuckling Captain Butler and plucky, selfish Scarlett for all that she is, a woman of her own worth during times when women were showpieces more than anything else. And i absolutely love the descriptions of the civil war background - it is sweeping, historically accurate and touching, many times. I can slip the movie in at any scene or pick up the book and spend a few hours undisturbed just lost in its language and flow.All of that said, i think it is important not to forget that Mitchell has not mentioned one word against slavery in the 800+ pages she penned, slavery being the burning, heart rending issue of the time the novel was set. Every country and state goes through change, for good or bad and we lose times that were precious, sentimental, valuable - or we lose a 'land of grace and plenty' as she calls pre war Georgia. But we also gain causes that are worth it in terms of human reslience and courage and value/respect for others. Looking at it that way the novel comes across like a victorian painting - pretty and appealing but lacking in soul.",
            "People read the book and leave all the politics aside if you're going to read this book. Enjoy it and remember this book was written in the 1930's. Very different way of thinking back then. I have read some of the reviews and I just threw my hands in the air and decided to write my review. That is how mad I got. Why? Well, everytime someone decides to write a review about a book that took place during the civil war someone has to put in there two cents, about how horrible the whites treated the slaves or how horrible slavery was. Please. Okay, yes slavery did happen. And I don't conden it niether. But everyday one can not escape not listening to it about the subject on t.v.(especially the Oprah show, I really think that lady spends her life talking about the subject, bitter woman, or movies, or songs, ect. ect. ect. From all I have read and seen and learned does one really believe all the plantation owners beat there slaves and killed them? I mean would a plantation owner who paid top dollar for a slave just take him home and starve him, beat him, and have chained him and just treat him worse than a dog. I don't think so. It just not possible that all plantation owners did that. If that really was widespread as we are lead to believe then now, then there would have been an uprising of slaves sooner then Civil War. There would not have been any need for a Civil War if all the whites of the South then were the cruel vicious monster we have been lead to believe they were. As allways when we have a small majorit of people to tell us history (that is t.v., roots, and all them bad history channels, and magazines and supposely non-fiction books that are written with the liberal mentality), they just re-write history. If one really wants to find out the history of the south. READ OLD BOOKS ON HISTORY!!! NOT THE NEW ONES!!! OLD BOOKS!!! WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT HISTORY IT HAS ALL BEEN RE-WRITTEN!!! Whew! I feel better now.Oh by the way. This is from a Hispanic telling you this.So if you really want to enjoy this book. Enjoy reading Scarlett scandals and her fight to never be hungry again. Enjoy her trying ever art she knows to take that poor excuse of a man Ashley away from the every loyal Melanie. Enjoy Scarlett when she tries to figure out Rhett and why she just cannot get it through her thick bull-headed head that she always has been in love him.",
            "Like it or not-- and there are PLENTY of reasons not to like GWTW-- this book earns its status as a classic. It reminded me of Anna Karenina: well-written, brilliant &amp; deliciously soapy plot, and ultimately depressing. In the end, I was fed up with Rhett &amp; Scarlett, but I still cried for them.As a northerner living in the south, I got a new appreciation for/insight into the rich history of white southerners, but good luck finding any insight into the world of black southerners. True, Mitchell was a product of her times and one needs to allow for that, but she says some HORRIBLY insensitive things about black people.If you read this book, keep it in context. Remember that it is only one part of history, only one book, somewhere in the middle of truth and lies and legend.P.S.-- Zora Neale Hurston's &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot; would be an interesting book to read afterwards, especially if you need to restore your faith in true love.",
            "Haven't finished yet (300 pages left) but I'm loving this book... nothing horribly suspenseful happens yet I can't put it down. It's also easy to read- I never find myself thinking, &#34;Okay, let's get on with it&#34; as most people expect to do from books of this time period. It's very long (1037 pages) but don't let that deter you!",
            "This could/should be the book required in high school on the American Civil War and Reconstruction. It's also a romantic novel from a female's perspective, which is an interesting twist on a genre that traditionally has male heroes.",
            "Margaret Mitchell's Scarlett was a strong woman who could just as easily lived in the 1960s as she did the 1860s. What a strong, admirable role model she must have been for girls when this book first came out in the thirties. All those pages and yet, I couldn't put the thing down.",
            "Mitchell combined love and war the way no other writer could have done it. The romance between Scarlett and Rhett left readers clinging to every word spoken between the two. In the midst of their world falling apart, Phett still had a passion for Scarlett, and Scarlett for Ashley. However, she never tells whether or not Scarlett ever gets Rhett in the end.",
            "Gone With the Wind is, obviously, my favorite book ever, but I truly believe it is one of the best ever written. I read this book when I was 12 years old, and I finished it in four days. I was so entirely engrossed in the setting, characters, and plot that I could honestly, literally just NOT put it down.Although the issue of which I am about to address did not bother or offend me in the least, however I am not racist or pro-slavery, I will talk about this in hope of enlightening a few more people and maybe helping to share the magic of GWTW. Sure, there are some things relating to racism, and of course to slavery, but I don't see why people are so offended by this. Yes, racism is wrong, and the way some slave owners treated their slaves, and how whites treated blacks, was absolutely horrifying, but, this is only a book. Slavery has long since been abolished and racism is now, thankfully, dwindling to almost nothing.At first, I'll admit, I was not fond of Scarlett, but after a while, I became used to her ways, and I really became absorbed into the book and felt as though I was walking in her shoes, and I understand why she did some things she did. The character development in this book is amazing; so is the extensive description.Gone With the Wind is such an amazing book for many reasons, but for me it has to be the ability which Mitchell has to take her readers into the story as though they were living the events themselves. I also loved the desperation and want Scarlett felt for Rhett as she realized she truly loved him, and of course, their stubborn relationship before they were married.There is not much more I can say that hasn't been said, except this: for hopeless romantics and avid readers (of which I am both), you will surely love GWTW. For everyone else: keep an open mind while you read. Remember that times have changed drastically and try to imagine if you were Scarlett yourself. Also, dive in the culture in which this book was written. Even if you don't agree with it, I believe everyone deserves an enjoyable read from of Gone With the Wind.",
            "Imagine that in a flurry, your old life disappears; what was once poverty and happiness has transformed into poverty and a new, bittersweet lifestyle. Welcome to Scarlett O'Hara's corrupted world, where what once seemed improper is now necessary to survive. I thought this book brilliantly combined romance, adventure, and non-fiction information based on the southern aspect of the Civil War.",
            "I must have read this book umpteen number of times and i find the characters of Scarlet and Rhett ever evolving .If u are a die hard romantic who believes in fighting for your dreams then this book is a must ...",
            "This book is quite fair, not exactly the best, but good enough. I thought it should be a very challenging book but I was disappointed...I read it last year (13 yr old) and was astonished on how easy the vocabulary is and how easy it is to read this book.As for the story...it's pretty good. I really like those historical novels, and the writing and descrbtion is wonderful... but some parts of the story is a drag.",
            "I love this book, I've read about 6 or 7 times at least. It's fun reading about someone more: clueless, and selfish than me.",
            "First of all: I adored the movie. I fell in love with Gable and with Leigh at the same time. Everyone could see that they were made for each other. I mainly expected a romantic love story when I started to read the novel. Yet it was nowhere to be found though a lot of reviewers seem to have seen what I obviously could not see.The first shock was that Scarlett is apparently only sixteen when she first meets Rhett, aged thirty-three, an already middle-aged, sophisticated man who chases after an incredibly shallow and vain teenager with much more gumption than wit. Scarlett is so emotionally immature and ignorant that it borders on blatant stupidity. I usually love it when the heroes indulge in verbal duels but those in this book I could not enjoy for Scarlett always looks foolish in them. To make it worse she is as cold as a fish, extremely childish and calculating. The authoress referred to her charm, intelligence and allure more than once but I couldn't see any of it except her beauty of course and that she was hard to get. She could be Becky Sharp's little sister but at least Thackeray's lady possessed intellect, a good judgment for people and a great sense of humor. To be fair I have to say that the heroine is resilient and smart when it comes to business. She also isn't afraid of hard work though exactly those only likeable traits make her suspicious to the good people of Atlanta. Yet Rhett was hardly a Harlequin hero either. Unlike his movie character he is bitingly sarcastic and acidly derisive instead of charming, amusing and witty. I found him considerably more sinister than Gable. He is violent, unreliable and really ruthless in a menacing way. With very good reason men usually don't like him. The way he is portrayed I couldn't like him either. I had no clue if Rhett loved Scarlett or not and if he did, why? Her reactions remained equally enigmatic in the novel. The book was surely a fascinating read for a lot of reasons but it made me unhappy in an unpleasant way. The characters often treat each other in such a hateful and cruel way that it was painful to watch. Whatever kind of love those two felt for each other, tenderness and true concern for the other seemed to have been no part in it. For fans of true romance I cannot recommend this book.",
            "Yes, it is a magnificent novel, an American classic. Filled with larger than life characters Gone with the Wind takes the reader to a chapter of American history not readily remembered (Southern Reconstruction) and to institutions we wish we could not remember (slavery, racism and the KKK).Lets talk about the novel. It is not a book for the faint of heart- my edition is over 700 pages. Yet, Margaret Mitchell has the gift to immerse you in a world that has long since passed. From the comfort of our armchairs it is difficult for us to imagine the sense of lostness the southern gentry must of felt during and after the war. They simply lost everything. Yet, there is something about the American character that does not want to give up, a stubbornness best personified by Scarlet O'Hara.I first read Gone with The Wind in the early 90's, it left an indelible imprint on my mind. About a year ago as I was persuing my library, it caught my eye again. I pull it for the self, sat down in my wing back chair and began reading eagerly anticipating being drawn into Mitchell's south once again. This time, however, I could not finish the book. A few hundred pages into it, I gently closed the cover and put it back into my library. What was it that caused me not complete this book? It was the blatant racism that seemed to permeate every other page.Yes, I realize that this book was written by a southerner reflecting a time and culture long since gone. Yes, racism is an appropriate subject to write about. Yes, one may write a novel that reflect the racism of the antebellum south- but this is one country preacher who will not read it again.",
            "Really, that's my only gripe. Too many pages and all that dialogue and long paragraphs with Mammy and Prissy and all the others talking so strangely. I blame it on Margaret Mitchell!But despite the length (1,037 pages) and overbearing dialogue, I found the book to be very enjoyable. It took me a whole year to read this damn thing, but at least I finally finished! And I am not going to read SCARLETT or THE WIND DONE GONE!Anyways, I loved the movie especially! Vivien Leigh is hot and gorgeous! Gable is Gable, classy and smug! I have the tape at home as part of my Best Picture collection. The movie is also long, at nearly 4 hours! But in the end, Mitchell did a good job. Alice Randall and Alexandra Ripley should be ashamed of themselves for thinking they could do better! HA!Pretty good reading, as long as nothing interferes with it. I found myself putting the damn thing away and leaving it for months on end. Thanks to my job with those bastards at the UF Foundation, I got a chance to get through it!I am the man!",
            "Gone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell is a classic historical fiction novel with vivid descriptions of the Old South and the Civil War. It is from the Confederate's point of view, and the protagonist is Scarlett O'Hara, a headstron, stubborn, and spoiled Southern Belle with deep strength and passion. If Scarlett needs something bad enough, she will not hesitate to throw away proper social conduct or her own personal goals. This strength comes not from within her, but from using the misfortunes of others to her advantage. She is like a child in the sense that she orders people around and always gets her way. The problem in the long run is that this strenth all too often blinds her to the good things and the love that reaches out to her, but she pushes them away, so set in her own ways that she wont even consider other possibilities. Tara is Scarlett's one true love, and she would do anything for it. Scarlett survives the hardships of war as her would falls down around her with only her wit and determination left. She cannot ignore life, nor can she put on a polite mask and act as though there had never been a war. She uses the struggle to rebuild Atlanta to make her start in business. Although Scarlett is a strong and independent woman, most people can relate to her because she makes mistakes like a normal human. This book examines different types of strength. Whether it is Mammy's honorable courage and dignity, or Rhett's keen level-headedness, or Melanie's Christian devotion to people, each person has his or her own root from which they draw their strength. The writing is superb, and the plot is dramatic and sad, but it includes enough of Scarlett's triumphs of strength that sets it apart from all other books. This is a must-read for any person who loves classic literature.",
            "This book touched the hearts of millions, and truly makes us realize the appreciation of life. I found myself so much like Scarlett, that I began to chenge my ways, and learned to be a self-less person. You know how the book always better than the movie? Well, for those of you who saw the film, (probably the best film ever made; it was rated higher than Titanic!), you can imagine how good this book must be!!! Trust me-TAKE MY ADVICE! I AM A FULL TIME READER!!! THIS BOOK IS THE CREAM OF THE CROP!!!!!!!",
            "I had to add my accolades to those who declare GWTW the great American novel, and weigh the vote beyond the 4+ it currently has. Who are these people giving a novel so rich in in scope, so remakable in the development, so intense you can smell the magnolias, a one? It is the only book I have ever read more than twice. Double or tripple readings are only for those very, very special books, right? If it were not for the movie and the hype, the book would have more respect. GWTW forever!",
            "This is a great novel. Do not let its success fool you into thinking it isn't that good. I won't repeat the many positive reviews here. Just let me add one note: the book has an extraordinary amount of cynicism in it which is startling at first but makes perfect sense as this novel is about the destruction of all that is good by men-on a large scale, the south's destruction, on a smaller scale, the destruction of Rhett's love by the vices and selfishness of Scarlett.",
            "I have read Gone With the Wind 16 times(I'm eleven yrs. old)and it still ties for my favorite book(with The Mists of Avalon) I know all anyone would ever want to know about the movie(and a lot more besides)and plenty about the book. The ending is perfect and appropriate for the story, the characters are interesting, tightly intertwined into the story, and so real it feels like I am standing there in a hoop skirt and corset whenever I read the book(my waist constricts and everything)",
            "The book is as good as it can get. I read it while in high school, then again a few years later while in college. I'd like to read its sequel. The climax however was not quite as hunky dory as I would have liked it. It was one of my first books other than the normal run-of-the-mill stuff like adventure stories so its left quite a positive impact on me.",
            "I loved this book. I read it twice in the past year. The story is beautifully written. Margaret Mitchell is a genious. The quote &quot;After all tomorrow is another day,&quot; is the quote we all will repeat to ourselves to make life seem easier. Life goes on.",
            "I first read GWTW when I was 16 years old, and I've been spellbound ever since. This is a book that truly made me feel as if I'd known the characters for years; I cried with every defeat and celebrated every defeat with Scarlett. Once you pick it up, you can't put it down until it's finished. I felt that it was similar to &quot;North and South&quot; in content, but that the emphasis on the characters was more personal. Also, it has a little of everything--history (without being dull), romance (without being overdone), and personal triumph.",
            "&quot;GWTW&quot; is one of my favourite comfort books; &quot;War and Peace&quot; is another. They are similar in that they are sagas involving families whose lives are changed by war and how characters are affected by war. Some people fall to pieces and cannot contemplate a 'new' life where they have no place( Countess Rostova and Ashley Wilkes); while others find a hitherto unknown inner strength (Natalia Rostov and Scarlett). Margaret Mitchell took 10 years to write &quot;GWTW&quot;, thus starting the book in the '20's. She drew upon the stories that she had heard as a child from Civil War veterans and her own mother . Scarlett is the heroine of the book and there are very few scenes (as in the film) where she does not appear. &quot;War and Peace&quot; was also written over a long period of time. Tolstoy's work focuses on an exhaustive cast of characters, and places the reader in scenes domestic (&quot;peace&quot;) and foreign -the battlefields (&quot;war&quot;). Mitchell keeps her reader confined to Scarlett's side with third person references to battles and other factors of war. One could write a thesis ( as I felt I was beginning to!) on this topic. Let's just say that both are wonderful books; &quot;War and Peace&quot; is considered a &quot;Classic&quot;, while &quot;GWTW&quot; a classic example of historical fiction!",
            "Gone With The Wind is a superb book. It's story is so intresting. Margaret Mitchell wrote a wonderful book. I believe Gone With The Wind is my favorite book of all time and I can not wait to read it again. I love the way Mitchell describes Scarlett, Melanie, Rhett and Ashley. This is a literary gold!",
            "I think &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; was a great book. I liked the book better than the movie. The book went into more detail than the movie. I wish Scarlett would have waited for Rhett when he was in jail though. I wish Scarlett would have just admitted to Rhett that she loved him sooner. I think Ashley was kind of a wimp, and I did not understand why Scarlett had wanted Ashley when she had a man like Rhett who wanted her. I was glad when she tried to get him back at the end and I can't wait to get the sequel.",
            "I'm 16, just finnished it, the only regret I have is not reading it sooner. Mitchell did a beautiful job. I became so swept up into the story I couldn't put it down for a second. It's almost like be there, back in the 1800's, during the civil war. You feel the characters, there joy, there pain. The movie wasn't that great! I look forward to reading the sequal. I highly recomend this book, you won't be sorry after reading it.",
            "During the past summer I read a tremendous novel, Gone With the Wind. Margret Mitchell is an amazing author even by picking up the dilect of Mammy and the slaves. Even though I'm not American and don't study their history I understood and learned a lot from this book. This book is comedic, dramatic, exciting and filled with romance. The friends/foes/lovers relationship between Rhett and Scarlett is unforgettable. I found this to be a truly inspirational book, how to treat people properly and how to be a true friend and lover. This book is amazing , I couldn't put it down and I finished it in only 3 days. I am also starting to read the sequel &quot;Scarlett&quot; by Alexandra Riply. I give this book 5 stars! *****Jenn",
            "I have reread this book four times in the last year, and everytime I read it, I catch more than the previous time. The love story told compares to that of Romeo and Juliet. The sequencing of events could not be better; it grips you until the last page, and leaves you wondering how Scarlett deals with her personal losses. The intermixing of historical fact and fictional characters is phenomenal. Never again will a novel soar as high as this; it is as popular as the Bible.",
            "I think that it is the best story I have ever read!! It was magnificent detail, and includes everything, from history to love to war and action. Amazing the way Mitchell makes you think about everything. I would reccomend anybody who likes good reading, to read it.",
            "I read GWTW when I was in the 5th grade. I fell in love with it instantly, and have never read a better book since. This book has affected how I think and act. You can't help but admire Scarlett and all she stands for. At times all she had was her determination to survive and her pride. Once in school we had to do a report on the person we most admire. I had to convince the teacher to let me do it on Scarlett. Whenever I come to a hard time in my life, I try to be strong and I compare strong to Scarlett. This book tells not only how the South was affected but how the lives of the woman left behind were affected by the Civil War. The book is so vivid that you feel that you are with Scarlett, Rhett, and all the other unforgettable characters. I hope that I meet a man like Rhett. He loved Scarlett for years, knowing the worst of her but still loving her despite her faults. The book is the epitome of the Old South; with all the grace, beauty, and pride to go along with it.",
            "I loved this book! I love to read about the Civil War and this book takes you from the beginning to the end of this great time period. I'm 14 years old and a lot of my 8th grade classmates thought I was nuts to read it. But I didn't let that get in my way. I've seen the movie and don't think it got even close to the book. If you want to read a great romance/adventure/tradgedy this is the book for you!",
            "I read Gone With the Wind in the seventh grade, and since then have read it several times. To me it is an inspiration; its plot is magnificent, its characters well developed and true. It is a book that truly embodies the dream of writing the &quot;Great American Novel&quot;",
            "Gone With the Wind is the realization of an author's dream - to tell an American story of American attitudes in a deceptively treacherous society that became completely uprooted during an extended period of political turmoil in the United States. The characters are beautifully developed, the flavor of the period is flawlessly interwoven with the stories of the characters' lives, and we cling to each minor triumph and defeat as Mitchell works her way through this huge book. This is one book that you will want to read several times.",
            "As the ratings show, this book is accepted by many people to be the best book ever written, and I must agree. It has been a source of strength for me in hard times, and it guided me towards my love of writing.",
            "There is so much lip service paid to how good this book is, and how everyone should read it, and yadda yadda yadda.The prose is boring, way too purple and prosaic. It makes Soap Operas look realistic.None of this speaks to the fact that the whole book is RASCIST. The south was built on the backs of African-Americans, and they died to build the South up. They are still fighting for equality, and now we have some romantic idealization of the South, and Margaret Mitchell makes the Klan look like some good group of good ol' boys.I am disgusted that a book this blatently racist and snotty is still held up as a classic.",
            "I use to feel bad about Sherman burning Atlanta, but that was before I read this book. Though it is a very well written book it is very offensive to; African Americans, women and of course Yankees.",
            "My father browbeat me into reading Gone With The Wind when I was a teenager. To this day I can't understand what all the fuss was about. Scarlet is such a spoilt snit that I couldn't care what happened to her. I guess this is one book you either love or hate, so I recommend that you check a volume out of the library and read a chapter or two. If you hate it, you've lost nothing but a little of your time. If you love it, well, there's no accounting for taste.",
            "IT WAS TERRIBLE! I hated Gone with the wind, at no time did it get my attention at all! I had all I could do to finish the book!",
            "I have just re-read GWTW for the fourth time and each timeI do I start out thinking it a magnificently written and researched book, with a glorious story - and the patronizing racist attitude of the author - yes, the author herself - makes me sick to my stomach.I devoured this novel when I was thirteen, again in my twenties, then my thirties, and here I am again, keen to know what will happen next to that sociopath Scarlett O'Hara the ultimate sexy, manly man, Rhett Butler and the dreamy dreamer and weakling, Ashley Wilkes.And yet - I believe this book should be banned. There are almost no books I feel that way about. I'm a writer and I abhor censorship. But this book is so outright racist it gags.Why should such stereotypes be allowed to continue for generation after generation to absorb?What would the world think of a romantic novel about dashing German SS officers and a beautiful blonde \"maidchen\" cavorting charmingly before concentration camp slaves? All the while talking about those slaves as if they were simply \"children\" who didn't know any better than to be wearing striped pajamas, carrying out humiliating tasks for their \"masters\" and existing pleasantly and contentedly in their cute little \"barracks\"? Critics would be up in arms. Such a novel would fall into disrepute and no one would claim it to be a great work of literature, even if it was well-written. So why do we stand for GWTW - this travesty of lies, lies, lies?I notice that one of the reviewers below mentioned that slaves weren't, in fact, badly treated. Hello! To begin with, slavery is slavery: an abomination upon the Earth. Any person who is enslaved is being treated badly. Period. Second, that reviewer should read Toni Morrison's \"Beloved\"to find out what it was REALLY like to live as a slave on a southern plantation. That depiction rings true. GWTW, on the subject of slavery, is complete clap-trap.Over and over again, it is mentioned that Scarlett's mother, \"Miss Ellen,\" would be \"turning over in her grave\" to see howScarlett betrayed her southern belle roots. Well, I contend that Margaret Mitchell is turning over in her grave because she knows what a monstrous mistake she made with GWTW. Hopefully, she's evolved, and, knowing her feminist views and her basic fairness as a person, I think she would agree with me - BAN THIS BOOK!",
            "For $10 you'd think there would be a working table of contents. Also don't forget the slaves depicted were from the masters' points of view.",
            "This book has permanently damaged my brain cells. If you are smart, don't read it.",

            "Margaret Mitchell's \"Gone with the Wind\" is a mesmerizing novel. I saw the movie when I was young and disliked it immensely. Therefore, I never read the book until it was selected for a book club. With some trepidation, I began reading and was immediately plunged into a riveting tale.This epic concerns the headstrong Scarlett O'Hara, a southern belle who becomes embroiled in the Civil War and Reconstruction Era. It is a story of Scarlett's selfishness and also her courage. The story revolves around the tumultuous relationship that develops between Scarlett and Rhett Butler, an enigmatic, harsh, and pitiable man who recognizes within Scarlett a likeness to himself. However, Scarlett's unrequited love for a gentler man, Ashly Wilkes, proves to be astumbling block to her happiness. Her unrelenting quest to obtain money also causes her to make many enemies. Scarlett symbolizes the changing times, and she and Rhett are a perfect match. Ashley represents the \"old ways,\" and thus this story can be seen as a symbolic journey. Times change, and people must adapt in order to survive. Although I do not necessarily agree with \"survival of the fittest\" mentality, the theme is addressed very poignantly in this story. I was repulsed by Scarletts ruthlessness, yet I also admired her courage and strength. Rhett was heartbreaking as he seemed to be ravaged by his own anger. He was a man who was desperate for love as are we all. Rhett seems to symbolize our own hungry souls. He is strong in some ways yet startlingly weak in others. He reminded me a little of the character Heathcliff in Emily Bronte's \"Wuthering Heights\".My only complaint of the book is the treatment of black individuals. Many people have written on this subject, so I will not do so here. I did like Mammy's character even though she was stereotypical.Mitchell's characterization is superb. My favorite character is Melanie Wilkes. She is portrayed as a gentle yet strong woman. Melanie is courageous in her own way, and I loved her bravery in standing up against others who criticized those she loved. I also felt empathy as well as repugnance for both Scarlett and Rhett. All the characters are memorable, and Mitchell paints a vivid picture of struggle, disstruction, and triumph as the people within the story fight against the ravages of war.This book will stay with you long after you read it. Please give this wonderful story a chance. I'll definitely watch the movie again. I think I'll have a better appreciation for the film. God bless you all.",
            "I've been a fan of the story since I first saw Gone with the Wind when I was a little girl. I didn't even know it was based on a book until all the media attention that the sequel Scarlett got when I was in junior high. I immediately went to the library and checked out Gone with the Wind. Even though I loved the movie I loved the book so much more. There are so many details that have been left out. Since then I've read a lot of other historical fiction but this one is still my favorite. There's a good reason why this is such a popular classic novel.",
            "After seeing the movie many, many, MANY timea, I finally decided I MUST read this book. This is my selection for our book club. I could hardly put the book down. The movie was wonderful, but the book is FANTASTIC! Love it, love it, love it. We will be discussing this selection in our book club in early February and I know each of our members are thoroughly enjoying this read!",
            "This was my third time reading this book, each time in a different age period and each time with different experience and reflection on the story and characters of this wonderfully lavish and complex drama. yes I agree that the story is biased and somewhat racist. However, it reflects the attitudes of the general culture and way of life that existed back then in 1800s during and post Civil War. Put that aside (or rather become familiar with that specific culture), the story is heartbreaking, informative, and really addictive. I mean I would definitely recommend that before starting this book, clear your schedule for a week or two because once you start it is hard to put it down until you have reached the last page! You just get drawn into the this very well written story and you fall in love with all characters that are portraited with all of their complexities, strenghts, weaknesses, and yes lots and lots of mistakes and misunderstandings! So much that it breaks your heart over and over again and you can't help but to shake you head or even swear at them!",
            "Gone With the Wind was recieved exactly when described and in the condition as advertised. GREAT book by the way.",
            "I first read Gone With the Wind when I was 16 which was more than 50 years ago if you must know. I have always loved the book and the movie. I was in the hospital for a while last year and knew that I would have a lengthy recovery after I got home, so I bought this edition for my Kindle and read a chapter or two every night and it really helped to know it was there at the end of my day. I read it leisurely and loved it once again.I know there are several versions, or editions, for the Kindle, and I don't know about the others, but this one was recommended and it was perfect.",
            "GWTW is one of the best books ever written. Mrs. Mitchell really captured the whole Cival War theme and added a ruthless heroine to the amazing plot to make it even MORE addictive. It tells the story of a woman with gumption, as she called it, spirit, pride, and an everlonging love for Ashley Wilkes. People say it is a racist and sexist book but, in truth, the opinions and views of the characters were how the Southerners thought in the Old South. She wrote about a dream and a mystery that did not survive but was the setting of a love so passionate and endearing that it cannot be described. It told the tale of Knights and their Ladies Fair, of master and of slave. I, personally, thought that the sequel was just as good but it did not give Scarlett the same ruthless qualities. But we must cut Mrs. Ripley some slack, it would be nearly impossible to equal a book as great as GWTW. The plot and characters were simply amazing. Scarlett, the conniving and strong woman that the book focuses on. Rhett, the lover and third husband to Mrs. O'Hara who loved Scarlett so much that it was almost unreal. Melanie Wilkes, the only true friend to Scarlett who was a true gentlewoman with a sense of polite gumption. And then there was Ashley Wilkes, the poor soul that was crushed when the war ended and a person who loved Scarlett dearly but could not and would not abandon his wife and child for society honor. These were the characters that sculpted the greatest love story ever told. It was a Civilization GONE WITH THE WIND.",
            "Fast shipment!!! Great Product! Can't wait to watch the movie again. I wanted this for a keepsake in case it went out of print!",
            "I was very please with the quality of the book and the speed of service. There was a mix up on the original order but was correct in a very timely manner and at no additional expense to me.",
            "Every woman has her Ashely and her Rhett Butler. Goes along with a line in my own book: \"A woman has but two loves in life, the one who breaks her heart and the one she spends the rest of her life.\" Yes, the depiction of people of color is uber lame and its all about the small percentage of Southerns who benefited from the semi-feudal system, but the story, oh the story is so thrilling, and the heroine so spicy. This book stretched the boundaries of what was acceptable at the time for women, and amazingly enough, still does. May you someday find your Rhett Butler, if only in this novel.",
            "I've been thinking for a long time that I should read this book--and I'm probably not alone. It's not like I don't know the plot, but still, I've always imagined that it's a classic piece of American storytelling. Let's just say that the writing can be hackneyed, and at times cringe-worthy. But what will make this book last is Mitchell's ability to tell a story, to make people want to turn the page, and experience what happens next. This skill is often undervalued and overlooked, but makes her talent stand above the abilities of others who can write a better sentence. I would recommend this book, not as a timeless piece of literature, but of storytelling.",
            "This was a gift for a family member. They loved it very much. Thank you for putting it on paperback.",
            "Just finished this story. Took a while. Glad I didn't live in that period. Now I know what all that dreadful war was about. I didn't know anything about it but now I am full up to the top! I have not read anything quite like this novel which took me weeks to read, and I thank my lucky stars I am me, living in a tiny country where people don't go mad. The sheer volume of words describing conflict, emotions, deprivation and loss was unbelievable. If you want to tuck up on a rainy day (or days) and learn what it was like to live in that century then this is the book for you. Scarlett needed a good smack, Rhett needed a good hug, Pittypat needed a box of tissues, Ashley needed a ramrod for his spine and Melly needed a sainthood. Yes, I understood what was written about the war, and loathed it, but isn't that what a story is supposed to do? Wring out your feelings? And I certainly am wrung out. This book gives you more buck for your dollar than many I have read, so go on - put your feet up and get stuck in to Gone with the Wind. Makes you feel grateful for what you have.",
            "after my dog ate my moms copy I never thought I'd get another one just like it! Thanks!",
            "Thank You for sending what I asked for. I bought a $2.88 hardback book and I cannot complain. All I wanted was all the pages attached to the binder and that is what I got. Plus it was kind of neat because someones Aunt had signed it to her niece. Shows me the book has been well loved.",
            "One of the greatest american epic stories of all time and one of the only books to ever be correctly adapted to the silver screen. Scarlet is a wonderful character as is Rhett. The only thing you could wish for is a slightly better ending.",
            "Believe it or not, the book is better than the film -- more historical insight and background.",
            "Some books you love and you forget the characters after a few days. Some books you love and the characters stay with you forever - Gone With The Wind is one of these books!",
            "When I first read this book a year ago, I fell in love with it.i really enjoyed everything about this book. I cant tell you witch parts i like more.This is the type of book that should be read by everybody!",
            "I loved this book. It is a classic and everyone should read it! The sequel is also a must read!",
            "Introduction: This classic novel is full of famous statements like `Tomorrow is an other day.' It is also made into a film, which had won 9 Oscar Academy Awards based on this story.Summary: This story is set in the American Civil War. Scarlet O'Hara is a pretty but proud young lady. She is living in the south of America. Gentlemen love her. But the prince in Scarlet heart is Ashley. Ashley is a bookworm. Although Scarlet loves him, he has chosen his cousin to be his wife. Scarlet is so angry and marry a man she doesn't love. But then the war breaks out. Scarlet's husband dies. The land south of America is losing from land north of America. She then finally finds her true love. Rhett Buttler, Scarlet's third husband has a wonderful time with her until Rhett finds a great secret about Scarlet...Opinion: I think that this story is absolutely wonderful. When you are reading the book, the character's personality will attract you. But I don't really like Scarlet. Although she is beautiful, she is vain and mean. It has a very good storyline. It makes you continue reading page after page. This book teaches us a lot of lessons. And it also tells us how bad, cruel war is. I think this is the greatest love story ever.Audience: This book is good for age 13 or above. It is good for everyone. But I'm afraid that the complicated story will confuse younger readers. J",
            "I read this when I was in 5th grade, and I fell in love with it! Scarlett is one of the most interesting, fun-to-read-about characters ever, and you're pretty much transported to the world of the antebellum American South.There's a reason this book has such enduring popularity!",
            "Gone With the Wind is an amazing book that leaves you a changed person.Treasure, treasure, treasure your first time read because the impact of this book is so deep you'll be left in a trance for days. Whilst reading this novel you will eat, sleep, breathe Gone With the Wind - so place any important activities on hold and don't read if there is any exams ahead!The first time you read it is a feeling that will be in your heart forever!!! A magical journey that grips your senses and rips at your heart, but devestatingly,can only be travelled once. But don't worry, although you can never really grasp those same feeling ever again, the book will still have you hooked everytime you read it. You will still hope and wish that Scarlett will find true happiness, even if such dreams are futile. I've read it on average once a year since that first awesome time and it neevr ceases to hook me in.The characters are all well-developed, particularly Scarlett (the main character). The reader is given a great insight and undestanding of Scarlett which is why she rightfully claims her spot in history. She is quite simply unforgettable. An amazing character who stands the test of time and, in my mind, has become a memory of a real person.Reader's should not look to this book for the rights and wrongs of slavery or deep insights of the civil war. This is a romance novel that Mitchell has intwined beautifully with minor war details and a subtle look into the pre-war South.There is a reason why this is one of the most well-known and purchased book of all time. Read it and you will find out. But be warned, the ending will break your heart and it will be as painful as any real-life romance. Hard to believe I know, but the characters so amazing that they stay with you 24 hours a day whislt reading and you feel their emotions like you are them. Margaret Mitchell was a very talented lady.",
            "The last book that I finished was Gone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell. It is set during the Civil War in the South, specifically in Atlanta. It is the story of Scarlett O'Hara and how her life changes during the Civil War and early Reconstruction. She is selfish and vain and will do about anything to rebuild her life after the North wins the war. She is left very poor and has to provide for the survivors of her family. She will do anything to make some money, even marry several times to people that she doesn't care for while the real \"love\" of her life is married to her sister-in-law. Scarlett just wants to have enough money to once again become the belle of the county.One character that she meets on this journey that I particularly enjoyed was Rhett Butler. Rhett is a charming, opinionated man with money that sees Scarlett how she really is and tells people the truth, however harsh that it is.I liked this book because it is about the Civil War, but through the eyes of a vain young woman whose life drastically changes. If you like historical fiction with a romantic twist, you will probably enjoy this classic tale of love between two interesting personalities.",
            "Hey, 'Reader from Santa Fe'. Yes there are passages which are cringeworthy. And do you know what? Thank God it's never been banned! For MM to have written it any other way would be a fib. No, I'm not talking about the glorification of slavery and their 'barracks.' I am with you and Toni Morrison 100% on the reality of this outrageous part of history. But for MM to have written it any other way would hardly ring true. Anyone who knows about her life knows that she was writing from the perspective that she did because that was her experience. She lived in a world of white supremacy and segregation, and do you know what? I read this and think thank goodness we don't now! Thak goodness I can have the friends that I want to and date the guys I want to, regardless of their background. GWTW is as much a historical document, albeit laced with southern pride, inasmuch as it shows what past attitudes were. I see GWTW as a great story nonetheless, with strong characters clashing with each other and riding roughshod over others in the name of self-survival. Not always attractive qualities, but qualities that have themselves survived. May I recommend The Wind Done Gone by Alice Randall? She writes that MM and GWTW inspired her to think. They inspired me too.",
            "After I read the Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood (by Rebecca Wells), I really wanted to read Gone with the Wind. In Sisterhood, Wells characters actually attend the premier of the movie. I have seen the movie, Gone with the Wind, several times, but, as usual, the book is much better. I really enjoyed the &quot;love story&quot; about Scarlett and Rhett. I wish Mitchell had written the sequel, which I have not read. She did an excellent job with the characters and I amnot sure if anyone could do it better. The story is true to life. Scarlett seemed to think the grass was greener on the otherside and that money/material things is the answer to everything. Not always true. Scarlett failed to see what she had in Rhett, until she lost him. Something to think about. I really hated to see this book end.",
            "The book &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; by Margaret Mitchell is my favorite book ever. Since I was only in sixth grade when I read it, even I found it a great book. Both the movie and the book have been American standards for literature. There are dozens of memorable characters, with plenty of juicy parts to hold it together. Even though it is 1,024 pages, it is very hard to put down. I read it over three months, about 20 pages a day, and I had to limit myself! This is surely the greatest book ever written. However, if you are the movie type, do not let me limit you. See the Academy Award winning move &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; with Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable give thier performance of thier career! Filled with lots of exciting characters, events, scenery, and detail; all of this is needed to create the best piece of American Literature, and &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; by Margaret Mitchell has it all.",
            "Ever since reading Gone with the wind in sixth grade, it has been my favorite book! It is fun and easy to read. Margret Michell knew how to perfectly balance a story with seriousness and pure comic relief. The story takes place during a rough time in the South, The American Civil War. Scarlet is devoted to the Cofederate cause, or at least at sometimes she seems to be. At other times she appears to be more devoted to herself. Rhett Butler, the other main character could care less about the outcome of the war, as long as he is benefiting from the finanical booms it results in. Both the characters are so equally stubborn making them perfect for eachother, but neither of them can see this until it may be too late.",
            "Gone with the Wind is by far one of the best written books of our century. It takes us back through time, to a civilazation long since forgotten. To a time when all was well in the Old South, where beauty ran wild amidst the red clay of Georgia. From the outbreak of the Civil War in the view point of Georgian belle Scarlett O'Hara, to the end and beyond we become engrossed to the point where it is impossible to put the book down. The story follows the life of Scarlett O'Hara daughter of a wild Irishman and an aristocratic but kind French lady. We follow Scarlett through her weddings and her childbirths, through her long trip home to her beloved Tara. We experiance her rejection and her revilation that the land is the only thing that really lasts and the only thing worth fighting for. Through her pain and her misery, through her laughter, and her tears we laugh with her and cry with her. We feel the hardships of war and the fury of the aftermath, and we watch, as does Scarlett and the rest of the all star cast, the destruction of a civilazation that is truly Gone with the Wind. For everyone who loves the Old South, for anyone who loves a good book. Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind truly touches her readers, and makes one unforgettable novel.",
            "I finally read this book years after seeing the motion picture. I fell in love with the characters and found my sympathies and compassion straining towards those I hadn't imagined I could feel anything for... Rhett knew what he was getting into, yet he loved Scarlet despite all her fall-backs and the knowledge he'd always be in another man's shadow. Rhett and Melanie were my favourite characters because they were both strong people who had the courage to love. I agree this book could be seen as racist, yet I also believe it is a historical novel in some parts which does justice to the Southerners side of the story. Yes, none of us agree with slavery. However, those were the times and that's how life was. Margaret Mitchell is being true. She displays the sympathies of the time her book is set. Judging it by modern standards of racism is the same as judging Shakespeare by modern political correctness. You can't. I belive this is a beautiful book and a beautiful love story. I encourage anyone with an open mind and a compassionate heart to read it.",
            "When I read this book I could not for my life keep myself away from it. I was changed, I was inspired, and I was genuinely mpressed and surprised. I was flabberghasted that a woman in that era would have that attitude and daring,(I say this on the part of the author, as well as the protagonist). Read this book, and have more insight! Loved it.",
            "As others have said in their reviews, GWTW is a great book. To repeat all the reasons why would be quite redundant of me. Simply, I recommend GWTW if one wants to discover the white southern female point of view concerning the Civil War era American south. I also recommend Harriet Jacobs' &quot;Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl&quot; to anyone BRAVE enough to discover the black southern female slave point of view concerning the Civil War era American south. Seeing as GWTW is very long, and Ms. Jacobs' work is around 200 pages, I'd read &quot;Incidents&quot; first. It's another truly amazing literary work...an account of southern slavery from the pen of a former slave herself! There is much much interesting information concerning the relationship between mistress and female slave/house attendant that will provoke thought as one reads GWTW afterwards.",
            "I started out reading Gone with the Wind last year, and I thought it was the most awful chore of a read ever. However, as soon as I hit page 400, it got really interesting. And when I was done, I had to admit that I loved it. It was the first (and only book besides Scarlett and The Exorcist) that made me cry. All I have to say is that, anyone who hates this book must either be dead or just moronic.",
            "This book was so good my friends are all reading it! I told every one of my friends about it, that's how good it was! It took me 4 days to read it, because i stayed up all night long just to finish it. The passion in this book made my spine tingle, and my heart beat faster than it has in a while! Anyone who reads it will find it one of the best books you'll ever find.",
            "... Millions of people not only remember Gone with the Wind, but re-read it faithfully. Literary critics and scholars don't like this book and wish it would go away. The reason? They can't quite account for its enduring popularity. It's sentimental. It doesn't break new literary ground. It's racist. Blah, blah, blah. And yet. How many other works of so-called \"popular fiction\" from the '30s and '40s are remembered, let alone read, today? None. How many are even in print? None. The hub-bub surrounding Alice Randall's satirical follow-up last year had less to do with that novel's merits than the near mythical status Gone with the Wind has achieved in American culture. Why? Because Mitchell tells a helluva story. Unforgettable and complex characters, an involving plot and a timeless theme: survival. The pacing, structure and language run circles around most books published today, yes, even those with literary aspirations. All this and heroine who dares not to be liked. Come to think of it, maybe Mitchell did break new ground. Pick it up. You won't be able to put it down.",
            "I expected this book to be just a dramatic love story but it is so much more than that.I fell in love with Rhett, expierianced all the pain scarlett went through,cried when Melly died and laughed over and over again at Rhett and scarlett's witty repartee.To me this means this is a great book and to anybody that will listen I would tell you that, to not read it would mean that you are really missing out on a wonderful expierience.",
            "This is a great book, I borrowed it from the library twice and then decided to just go ahead and buy it. I bought the paperback version, which is great to read, but my only problem was it falls apart. After reading through about 2 chapters, and only one week of owning the book, the paper had separated from the back. I definitely would recommend the book, only get the hardback one.",
            "It isn't all about the romance. Let me just blurt this out: Rhett is the HOTTEST MAN and after reading this you will be disappointed in every man you meet! He makes my blood boil like mad! He drives me mad! God, he's so damn sexy. He truly knows a woman and what she wants, and definitely what I want. I suggest that every man read in detail of Rhett's kissing technique because we need more men with skills like those. But enough of my gushing. Gosh, I wish I could have met this gifted writer who has combined multiple themes, tones, characters, and ideas and weaved it into this novel. I am not kidding nor exaggerating when I say this is the best novel, was always the best novel, and will always be the best novel. I've never laughed so hard or sobbed so much for a book. Everything fits right into place. THis is a perfect symphony on which the description of setting flow so well into the characters. I love the clever remarks of Rhett. Yes, he's VERY clever, as well as sexy. However, this is NOT a trashy romance novel. Margaret Mitchell does not give the usual and cliched damsel in distress heroine. Many intelligent and not-so-intelligent people have complained that of supposed rape, the inaccuracy of slaves were actually treated by their owners, and other indecencies. The one about rape is a flimsy complaint that can be easily refuted because it wasn't and the description of the scene fully suggests otherwise. However, the latter complaint has more value. However, if you really want to see the truth of the treatment of black slaves, just pick up Howard Zinn's A People's History of the United States for such purposes. I am glad that the heroine was an imperfect hero. She was as real as any human. Scarlett is the person name for her because it certainly reflects her red-hot devotion to her beloved home Tara and her parents. Other characters such as Melanie and Ashley were so excellently developed. The characters can't get any closer to reality. However, I have lost many nights of sleep for reading this. This is so addictive that I could give up sleep for days in a row.",
            "As the title of the movie portrays it, &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; is the disappearance of a whole civilization after the Civil War, or a civilization gone with the wind. The movie is about the different stages at which the South was before, through, and finally during Reconstruction. At first, we observe how the Southern aristocracy lived during their peak years when the price of cotton was up in the skies. At the barbecue at Twelve Oaks, the Wilk's plantation, the movie depicts the arrogance of the southern gentlemen, since most of them wanted to go to war and blabbered expressions like, &quot;...a southern gentlemen is worth any ten yankees...&quot; They are all absolutely sure that they will win the war in a matter of months, but as it turned out they were absolutely incorrect. During this part of the movie, the views of the South that we observe are pretty biased, because slaves were treated as part of the family and with a lot of respect. In some plantations like the O'Hara's it could've happened, but it was very rare. Suddenly, when war is declared all of the southern beaux go to enlist into the army feverishly. The only one with a realistic view is Rhett Buttler, since he tells the men that before they start talking about victory they should be concerned in building more factories to supply their troops with such things as weapons and clothing. At this time, Rhett is looked at with scorn. But afterwards, he becomes a hero because he is the one who breaks the Union blockade and smuggles supplies into Charleston. When the war drags on, the south is just lingering its defeat. The movie also depicts the southern courage during the war, but with just courage and persistent one can't with the war. The movie is actually very realistic when it shows the wounded and the lack of supplies the southern hospitals had to help them. Finally when the war is about to end, we see General Sherman's troops marching into Atlanta and the evacuation of the city. In this scene, the movie also portrays Scarlett's courage by managing to take Melanie and the baby to Tara. When they finally arrive to Tara, we really see the devastation that took place at the South by the Union troops. At this moment, Scarlett vowed that no matter what she had to do, she would never suffer from hunger again in her life. Later, the carpetbaggers, or the blacks that come from the north, and the scalawags, southern people that supported reconstruction, make life very harsh for the southern people. They raise the taxes to the skies knowing that there is no way for them to be paid, but Scarlett with her strength and wit manages to pay them. Finally when she is established and married to Mr. Douglas, she starts a lumber business with Ashley Wilks. All her old friends criticize Scarlett, since she has become a scalawag herself and is dealing with the northern merchants. This part of the movie is very ironic because Ashley refuses to gain profit from forced labor, in this case prisoners that are brought to the mill by an overseer. Scarlett replies that he used to own slaves, but he tells her that even if the war didn't occur, they were going to be free when his father died. Again we observe the nostalgic and sympathetic view towards the South in the story line. Finally, the movie also presents the reactions that the Southerners had against the colored people. When Scarlett is attacked in the dark side of town, her husband and the other men pretend to be in a 'political meeting' while they are raiding into the blacks area burning their houses and killing some men. They wanted to 'clean' this area so it was safe for Scarlet to travel to the mill. Similar events did take place after the war. In fact, some of them took place in a larger scale and included lynchings and other violent acts. This anti-black feeling lead to the sprouting of groups like the Ku Klux Klan and the violence among both groups continued for a long time. Overall, &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; is a great movie that gives us a feeling of what it was like to live during the Civil War. Although it gets carried away sometimes by being slightly biased, the movie is a very good representation of the events that took place during this period. Besides from providing some historical evidence, it presents the different feelings and responses that the people had towards the confli",

            "The cover of this book appealed to me more than the classic, hardback and so I purchased it instead just a few weeks ago. The book arrived on time and everything appeared to be in perfect condition. However, the old adage, \"You can't judge a book by it's cover\" must be very true, indeed, considering that at least two pages are missing and that one is replaced with a later page.With that aside, being that I am an avid reader, I'm almost ashamed to admit that I have not read this book until recently and fortunately, I wasn't succumbed to it despite all of the cult-like adoration it receives. Besides Margret Mitchell's writing being possibly the best I think I've ever come across; passionate descriptions, believable characters and dialogue, etc.,GWTW is filled with anti-equality, anti-Republican, hate speech that is impossible to ignore, and the book could have easily been shortened by at least 300 pages. Though Mitchell's writing style was obviously brilliant, she tended to delve too far into trivial details concerning things that were utterly pointless in my opinion.I agree wholeheartedly with another reviewer that Ms. Mitchell would possibly have an extremely difficult time getting her book published today.",
            "Let yourself get lost in Atlanta with the characters of Gone With the Wind. You'll yearn for a sequal. If you've seen the movie, you've really seen a different story that what you'll find in the book.",
            "I...wasted about two months reading this book. I STARTED reading it because it is so talked about I figured I should. I came to the conclusion that I should spend my time reading books I find entertaining. I don't see how anyone could possibly find this book entertaining. The three stars I gave it are because it is a well written book, and I figure, hey any book with this kind of a reputation deserves something. One note, what about this son of Rhett's? Did Margaret Mitchell just forget to tell us the background on him? Obviously there is a big story behind that...all I can figure is that he is the child of Belle Watling, as the book never really did say why he got involved with her in the first place. I dont feel like reading a sequel that wasnt even written by Margaret Mitchell to find out what happens... Anyway, a well written book and I accomplished my purpose...to be able to say that I have read Gone With the Wind. Other than that I didn't get a whole heck of a lot out of it.",
            "Gone With the Wind is one of my favorite novels, and I previously owned it only in paperback, so purchased this hardback just over a year ago. I read it after purchasing it, and then it went on a bookshelf. When I brought it back down to let my daughter read it, she commented that the pages were coming out, and sure enough they were. The glue in the binding has lost all of its stickiness and the pages are all completely coming out. What a HUGE disappointment after the money spent. I was better off with my paperback. Do NOT buy this format of the book.",
            "oh god the ending! the ending! the ending!(it is best to read the book before you watch the movie)",
            "It never got boring. Every page was exciting. The character of Scarlet O'Hara is one that will be your favorite forever. All of her imperfections just make you love her more. It was one of those books that you wish wouldn't have ended, even though it is well over one thousand pages long. It is almost sad to think that no other book, in my mind, will ever live up to Gone With the Wind.",
            "No words can express the feelings this novel has evoked in millions of readers across the globe, and in myself, as well. It sings a song of such captivating music that it tears itself into the very epitome of one's soul; Gone with the Wind has moved me, touched me, held me. It sheds light on lessons more precious than gold or silver, more valuable than platinum. I could go on and on...but I'm sure you get my drift. Cry, weep, laugh, smile...whatever you do, don't be a fool...don't miss out on this one.",
            "I loved the book and I am currently reading 'Scarlett' to see if Scarlett does indeed get her man... I enjoyed reading all about the Civil War and the terrible effects it had on the Southern people. I thought Scarlett, Rhett and Mammy were fantastic characters - although I must admit I did, occassionally, feel like banging Scarlett and Rhett's heads together!! I couldn't stand Ashley - what a wuss!! I particularly liked Melanie, she seems like such a weak little goodie good two shoes but, in fact, she is actually a very strong, courageous woman and the truest friend you could ever have. A wonderful novel - I can see why it is a classic!!",
            "I first saw the movie, and I loved it, so I decided to read the book. I found that the book had so much more depth than the movie which I had already thought breath-taking. Scarlett is someone we can all relate to, yet hopefully not too closely. It is always difficult to stick with a book that is sooo long, but Gone with the Wind was one that wasn't a problem. I loved how Scarlett realized that she loved Rhett because I think that many people overlook their true loves for a lust object that would never make them happy. The book was amazing because it was so beautifully polished and taught many valuable life lessons. I would recommend it to anyone!",
            "Gone With the Wind is one of the best books ever written! It teaches a wonderful lesson. No matter what happens, there is going to be a tomarrow, and you shouldn't give up hope! Scarlett lost everything, but she was still strong and she still had hope. Margaret Mitchell is a wonderful writer. Scarlett and Rhett and her other timeless charactors are so real to me and to millions of people. Only a great book could have such an impact on America and the world that GWTW has!",
            "This is one of the best books I have ever read. If you don't enjoy it, there is something mentally wrong with you! (Just kidding-sort of) I can understand how it could be a challenging book, it IS over 1,000 pages long, however it's worth it. I knew a girl with a learning disability that caused her to read at a very slow rate, therefore giving her a genuine hatred of books. Someone gave her a copy of Gone with the Wind, and though she started it grudgingly, she couldn't put it down, and believe me, she read through that book faster then..well, (stick analogy here) it's a wonderful book! It gives you a true understanding of the south. That's the way it really was. Tara forever.",
            "This probabaly has to be the best book ever written. Mitchell did a great job on the plot, characters, everything! What she did the best on was the characters. Those were definetly three dimentional characters. When you are done you think that there is no way that this is fiction because Scarlett, Rhett, and everybody seem so real. You also come to like Scarlett because with all her faults, she is still a brave and strong character. Trust me, don't be intimadated by its size. It will probably be the best book you ever read.",
            "I love the movie Gone With the Wind, so I decided to read the book. I read the whole, 1,000-plus page book in a week! It's every bit as good, if not better. It is much better at explaining history and certain situatuions than the movie. (If you didn't understand the buisiness about the attack at Shantytown in the movei, read the book for a better understanding.) Margaret Mitchell also gives vivid, loving descriptions of the Old South, though I had to skim most of them so they wouldn't slow me down! She also gives vivid characterizations of all the main characters and quite a few more who weren't in the movie. The story is very enthralling and never boring. I definitly recommend it.",
            "Its an unforgettable experience. When i read this book, i was not aware of any hype about this book. I just remeber the day i read this book in the library, back in India. Its a sunny morning. I just picked this book from the reference section, as i was waiting for some card or something, and started reading it. It was 7 in the morning, Few minutes would have gone,i think becuse, i have shifted myself a little. Suddenly somebody tapped me on the shoulder. Its the librarian. She said its 10 at night ans she is closing the library. She allowed me to take the book with me and I read it on and on until 8 in the morning, which was when i finished it. For 24 hours without food and sleep, without even a silghtest glance away from the book.Wahw Its truely an incredible experience.For one whole day i was beside the Scarlett, mind and soul.It is at that moment, i decided if Americans are down to earth as those characters, then it should not be very bad place and i came to America. After i came here and what i found, Its totally different story!!!",
            "I read this amazing novel approximately two years ago, since then I have read it several more times. It only took me about one week to read, I was so wrapped up in it that I put off homework to read it, I simply couldn't put it down. Believe me I don't read anything that fervently, other than Gone With the Wind. It is so descriptive, it wraps you up in this amazing story of love lost and lives, wasted on petty things. I personaly felt for the characters, being a hellraiser myself, I truely felt for Scarlett's plight and pain. I think that if you are a person who can be unaffected by all the media hype put into things, and just read this book you will be swept away by it's dazzling imagry and depiction of life and love and loss.",
            "This book is absolutely fantastic. I am 14 years old and believe me at the beginnning I absolutely loathed my best friend when she tried to convince me to read this book. She was so persuasive that I finally relented.....and I dont regret it one bit. THis book was so captivating that I found it so hard to put it down. Margaret Mitchell has indeed done a fantastic job. Her descriptions are excellent and the conversations are well written indeed. This book is definitely a must read for all those who love Classical novels for it is unique and quite unbeatable.",
            "Gone With the Wind is a great book about a young woman named Scarlett O'Hara who is selfish and cares only about herself as she struggles to keep herself alive during the Civil War. If you enjoy reading stories during the Civil War, this is the book for you.",
            "Gone with the wind is definately my favorite book of all time. Margaret Mitchell portrays Scarlett and Rhett and everyone else with such detail that i felt i was watching it all happen. Every joy, every sorrow.... It is absolutely impossible to put down!!! My suggestion: read it on a weekend with nothing planned, and keep a box of tissues nearby. (can't wait to read the sequel, Scarlett)",
            "I've loved GWTW since I first saw it at the age of 12, but it wasn't until I was almost 30 before I read the book and boy was I surprised! Scarlett had more than one child! Margaret Mitchell wrote about characters other than those in the movie and once you read the novel, you'll wonder how Selznick was ever able to get the movie made. What a story. What an author. Read it and finally understand.",
            "This is the world's best book EVER! I have read hundreds of books, and not one rivaled this one! If you never read another book in your whole life, read this one. It is so amazing. You can't put it down. MM spins a web around you and you are trapped until the book is through. For two days after I read the book, I talked of nothing but the book (I am dead serious-ask my mom) Scarlett changed my life, she inspired me, she taught what to do- and what NOT to do. This book is the greatest.",
            "This book is the best book I have read in a long time.Although I first saw the movie, I was enchated with the book.Gone with the wind takes place around 1862, when the civil war strikes in The United States and tells the story and problems that Scarlett O'hara had to face.She is a spoiled and stubborn woman and that's why she never realizes the love she feels for Rhett Butler.Both of the main characters are stubborn persons,they love each other but in the same time they distrust their feelings.Rhett believed that Scarlett was in love with Ashley Wilkes and she believe he spent his time with another woman.Their distrust makes tem try to hurt each other in every way and they never get time to tell their feelings. The story is sad,romantic,historical and wonderfully written and the end surprises every one who read it.I completely loved this story and I recommended it to everyone who wants to read a true book.This classical novel will bring you to a world where you never imagined you could be when you read a book.There will never be a book such as.... GONE WITH THE WIND.",
            "Your initial reaction after seeing the movie is, &quot;How could this be any better than the movie?&quot;. But when you start in on the 1,000+ page epic. Your questions are answered in a few short paragraphs. Mitchell did her research and managed to produce on of the finest authoring efforts the history of American literature has ever seen. She managed to intertwine bits of her own life into the novel and provided her readers with a brilliant pallet of realistic characters. If there is any book that could make a reader weep, this is it. However, you have to keep warm while reading this to keep the goosebumps down.",
            "This is an amazing book. Suspensfull, and romantic, i was hooked by the first chapter. This classic story is the romantic tale of Scarlett O'Hara Hamilton Kennedy Butler, the strong, smart women of the civil war. The book tells the story of her growth as a person, her strength, her willfullness, and is an ongoing source of delight, tears, and endless romance. I recommened it to everyone and anyone. It is my very favorite book. Margaret Mitchell weaves a colorful and expressive masterpiece, and i am all praise! Read this book!",
            "a book about romance usually bores me. It's no more than datings and marriages and divorces and remarries and who loves who. But definitely not this one. Mitchell has set an example on how to write a great romantic novel. And it's not merely a romance, it's a historical romance. And Mitchell was not merely an author, either, she was a historian. I see this book from three perspective; as a reader, a woman, and a college student majoring in International Relations. As a reader, I surely recommend this book to anyone, especially those interested in Civil War, American History and last but not least, romance. But one small tip, you might consider reading this book during your long break, since it's hard to put it down. As a woman, I view Scarlett O'Hara is a pure material girl, until life gives her valuable lessons about losing all the people she actually loves all her life that she did not realize before. But Mitchell created a good balance by adding a lot of good personality traits; hard working, courageous and brave. I admire especially her fast maturity she got after the O'Haras lost their once prosperous plantation and her high ambition to bring it back to a great plantation after Civil War did a damage to it. Also, Scarlett values richness not just for the money and pleasure it brings, although she did say several times that money is the most valuable thing in life. She also values richness to satisfy her dreams to see the world. As a Southern woman ( well-bred too ) on her time, Scarlett surely was one of the few who values brain beside beauty , which she shows by running her second husband's store and lumber yard and not a bit pay any attentions to other Atlanta ladies who despise her. Scarlett might be full of airs and graces, but she keeps it in the right place and the right time. Thirdly, as an international relations student, this book is qualified as a history book on the Civil War. Mitchell added a great deal of details not only about Civil War but also about slavery, which brought me to give more credits to her. A lot of book about slavery in the South view black slaves only as those who were looked down by their white masters. But not in Gone With The Wind.Mitchell viewed them as part of the family who had their white masters' full trust, like Pork, Mammy and Uncle Peter. It is the first time I found out that they also had something as social status in those days by being owned by different kind of white masters.",
            "This novel is a great piece of historical fiction, and it's not just for women, either. Set in the American Civil War, the story is about the life of a Georgian Southern Belle who is abruptly thrust from her pampered plantation life into the harsh realities of a very brutal war. Only her courage, strength, and resourcefulness get her through the wartime travails. That, however, is only the beginning of her struggles. After the war Scarlett faces the challenges of poverty, loneliness and death. She ends up being married three times (and burying two of her husbands), owning her own businesses, killing a soldier (and stealing the money and goods in his pockets), and generally doing everything considered unladylike at the time. Fictional characters set in an historic time, this book is a classic in every sense of the word. I've read it countless times (I still get something new out of it each time) and it should be in every well-read persons library. The movie of the same name follows the story closely (although some things had to be left out in the interest of time), stars Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable, and is widely regarded as one of the best films ever made.",
            "I absolutely loved Gone With the Wind. I read over the summer because it was one of the choices on my school reading list and my mother and sister had read it and loved it. I didnt expect to like it all that much, but I was hooked after the first ten pages. It has become my favorite book. I couldn't stop thinking about it when I finished. I have reread it at least three times, and I am still left with the same feeling I had the first time. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. I would give it ten stars if I could.",
            "I am sure that there are thousands who share the same feeling - there cudn't have been a more realistic &amp; close to heart character portayal than that done by Mitchell. One has to read the book to understand how it can affect a person. I am sure no female ever gets over Rhett Butler (not even when her hair has turned gray - example my English literature teacher at school) and no man can resist Scarlett's charms (they are in the same boat as that of other fictitious characters in this epic).A must read.",
            "&iexcl;Gone with the Wind&iexcl; is my all-time favorite novel. I&iexcl;m so obsessed with the book that I think about it every day, in spite that I&iexcl;ve read it for like a hundred times. I cannot tell why I cannot get enough of the book. I&iexcl;ve been trying to tell myself that it&iexcl;s just a book of 1000 pages, telling the story of a belle&iexcl;s maturity and struggles for living, yet I just can&iexcl;t cut off my bond with it.Due to the colorful plot and intriguing dialogues, my opinion about it changes with time. As I first read it during junior high, I viewed it as a moving love story. Oddly, there was a time that I really hated the novel because it inevitably posed discrimination on African Americans. Nevertheless, my love for it was resurrected on my way of learning to grow up, for I highly respect the female main character, Scarlett O&iexcl;hara&iexcl;s courage and passion for living. Above all, I can always get something from reading the book.With its vivid description, I can picture a broad land, a luxurious house, people&iexcl;s looks in my mind. Though the novel is already pretty lengthy, still some parts were unsaid, leaving to readers&iexcl; imagination. I guess that&iexcl;s one of the reasons that make the book so catchy and unforgettable. With its classic movie version, it&iexcl;s amazing that my thoughts about it remain unaffected.The book is generally true to its historic background, and since the author depicts female mind profoundly, I can easily comprehend the idea she tried to convey or the metaphors. When Scarlett is happy or heart-broken, it seems like I&iexcl;m just there on the scene, feeling the trouble or pleasure she is confronted with. And it&iexcl;s one of the few books that make women respectable and independent, causing me to identify with it even more.I won&iexcl;t deny the fact that I&iexcl;m an incurable fan of the novel. It enriches my life and somehow glorifies my imagination. I will follow the strong determination the book suggests: &iexcl;Never ever give up!&iexcl;",
            "Gone with the Wind is a wonderful book. I just finished reading it a few days ago and I was blown away.I loved and hated Scarlett .Even though the ending is heartwrenching, Scarlett took Rhett for granted and she'll get him back somehow, she always gets what wants. Up until I read this book I never realized how rough it was for the south during and after the Civil War.This is a must read, if the book doesn't interest you now, try it again later, that's what I did.!",
            "I cannot describe how great this book was. It was the best book I ever read and I know I will read it more than once. Gone with the Wind had such a charm to it that is bound to sweep you off your feet. If want a book that gets you hooked in the first line of &quot;Scarlett O'Hara was not beautiful, but men seldon realized it when caught by her charms, as the Tarleton twins were&quot; to the last lines of this heart-wrenching book, then this book is a sure way to be enveloped. It tells of the southern life during the Civil War. Even if you aren't interested in history, like I am not, you can still be sure you will love it. I recommend this book to anyone who has patience and who loves Love-stories.",
            "Gone with the wind was the best book I have ever read. It is utterly captivating. Scarlett, the main character in the book, is someone that everyone should strive to be unlike, but secretly, throughout the whole book, you are rooting for her. Even at the stupidest things, you cry when Scarlett feels distraught. It will come deep into your soul and play with you emotions until all you can do is focus all your energy into reading this book. From the beginning to the end, you won't be able to put it down. It is a great (and sometimes quite graphic) display of what the civil war does to people and their beings. You will not regret reading this book, in any way shape or form. It is the most tantalizing book you will ever read. It is a great love story of desperate unrequited love and of hidden emotions that never show themselves until; it is unfortunately, too late. Everyone should have the experience of reading a book that is so magical that you really will never forget the way you felt through each amazing chapter. It is a must read for people over the age of ten. It will make you blood curdle and go cold at almost the same instant. Don't pass up the opportunity to read this book about the infamous love triangle of Scarlett O'Hara, Rhett Buttler, and Ashley Wilks. Never again will you find a book so worthwhile.",
            "Are you looking for a book that will be refused to put down? Then you may have just hit the ultimate jackpot;Gone with the Wind is a flurry of different themes that come together in one book,each of which beckon the reader to follow word after word to the last period.From romance to adventure, this book brilliantly entwines descriptions that come alive and stir emotions from deep in your heart.The author,Margaret Mitchell, carefully picks out her characters to make a rather interesting and unique combination that make this novel come to life.Join Scarlett O'Hara,the once pampered belle of the County,as she fights to regain her old life's treasures after the destructive effects the Civil War.Some will be frustrated,others,left melancholy,but the outcome of this beloved story is guaranteed to be breathtaking,one way or another.",
            "There will never be another book to match the greatness of \"GONE WITH THE WIND\". No matter how many times I read it and re-read it I have always falling prey to it's spell of great reading. I don't care for other people who have a fanatical hatred for this book. It seems sad that these people who call this great classic racist are also the same people saying that the South deserved what it got and the southern people too got what they desereved. How can they even suggest such a thing? The killing of civilians, the pillaging, the murder of whole families and black ex-slaves, the stealing of homes, the burning of whole towns, civil liberties taking away when the south and it's people were doing their best to start again and be part of the Union again after the war, martial law being the order of the day for over five years, the robbing of state government money, over taxation again for the South and it's people after the war and after taxes being one of primary reasons for the the war, the murder of many more man and their families for being defiant against a Government that lied to them again, and all is being condoned by people who live now in the present who say the Southern people deserved what they got for having slaves and daring to follow what the Consitution allowed? the right of session. Do these people not know the law? history and American governmentworkins?, and the right of session being an American and constitutional right?. How sad. Gone With The Wind is a book. A great book. The story of Scarlett O'Hara and her fight to never be hungry again, her fight to never let the Yankees beat her, and her fight to keep Tara her land from the Yankees. Scarett is a role model for anyone who will do anything to survive when the time comes to keep from being poor. Whether she is spoiled, caculating, and shrewed or just plain mean she gets what she wants, just like I think she would have gotten Rhett back sooner or later. Or Rhett would have come back. He loved her too much and waited to long for her to just give her up easily. Remember how he waited till the burning of Atlanta to enlist in the Cause to save the Condfederacy, of course he would have returned back to her in the end. And for all the people who think slavery was the only issue pertaining to the civil war. Read your history. Not public school history or present history. Read real history before 1970. You'll get the history you were robbed from. Remember slavery was legal so that made it okay in the eyes of the law before the Civil War. It was legal. It didn't make it right. Abraham Lincoln too said he wasn't sending troops South to end slavery, he was sending troops to end the Antebellum South.",
            "Gone with the wind is an all time classic. This book is about a girl named Scarlett O'Hara who has a wonderful life until war breaks out and her world is turned upside down.She has to learn the basics to surviving but it comes with difficulty. Along the way she loses two husbands but has one final one which lasts. His name is Rhett Buttler. He helps her become a rich woman again. But is she truly happy? You will have to read to find out. Through all of this there is a moral which is, don't take what you have for granted and apprciate what you have because one day you may not have it.",
            "This book is by far the greatest love story of all time. The ignorant Scarlett O'hara is accustomed to getting her way all the time, but suddenly her once so stable, cushioned life falls out from between fingers. Choosing which dress to wear to balls used to be the issue, now Scarlett must struggle to find each meal, not only for herself but also for the family she supports. As the end of the war begins to approach Scarlett is a young woman who has seen the worst, and still hopes for the best. This book if the timeless tale of a Confederate blockader and a fiesty Southern belle.",
            "Read this book. And then read the sequel by Alexandra Ripley. Gone with the Wind is THE BEST! Beautiful, witty, definitly involved. What I love about these two books is that I became the character. I had read about her so much that I knew her inside and out, and I like books that do that for me. Margaret Mitchell is truly amazing and Alexandra Ripley did an outstanding recreating Scarletts life.",
            "I first read this book at the age of ten and have re-read it at least 15 times over the last decade. With each reading, I admire Mitchell's characters more and more. Mitchell's pen has an unerring eye for the telling detail. Aside from Rhett and Scarlett's stormy love, I think one of the most complex and fascinating relationships in the book is that of Scarlett and Melanie. Although Scarlett thinks she hates Melanie, she really depends on her as a substitute mother, and whether she realizes it or not, her actions towards Melanie are truly generous and good. Melanie, for her part, seems to worship Scarlett almost to the point of idolatry, and from the Twelve Oaks Barbecue scene until her death at the end of the book, never ceases protecting Scarlett from her detractors - just like Ellen O'Hara. Melanie is the only person who can ease Scarlett's anxiety about her fog nightmares other than Rhett. One of the most tragic things about the story is that when Scarlett fina! lly realizes just how much she loves and needs Melanie and Rhett, they are both lost to her on the same day. I've always wished that Mitchell had written a second volume (the Ripley book is wretched!), although I myself don't really see how Scarlett could get Rhett back, and there are no other people in her life who could take Melanie's place. Mitchell's story is both inspirational - Scarlett offers many lessons on how to cope with adversity, sorrow, and loss - and a magnificent exploration of the complexities of the human heart and mind. Each time I read this book I almost forget where I am and what else I should be doing. Margaret Mitchell was a great storyteller. I wish this book was longer.",
            "This is an incredible book! I found it extremely hard to put down. Margaret Mitchell guids you through all of the human emothions with this one. I is a griping novel about this civil war and it truely shows you what a horrible thing war is. Although I have not had that much time to read many books I can easily say that this book is the best I have ever read. I would esily give it 6 stars!",
            "When I picked up this book, I expected a long romance novel about a woman and her lover. What I read kept me up until 3 a.m. trying to finish it in one sitting. I would reccommend it to anyone. The one star I removed was due to the fact that it sometimes became confusing, with all of the marriages and deaths. I loved it. I severely do NOT reccommend to ANYONE the sequel, Scarlett.",
            "This book, Gone With the Wind, was so beautifully written that it seemed like the characters came off the page. Scarlett was not just someone from a book, but actually someone who lived.The book was the tale of Scarlett O'Hara from when she was 16 till she was 28. At the beginning of the book, Scarlett, daughter of a wealthy plantation owner, is in love with Ashley Wilkes. But Ashley is to marry his timid cousin Melanie Hamilton. Scarlett is very upset, but ends up marrying Charles Hamilton, Melanie's (also timid) brother to hurt Ashley. But war starts, and the men go off. Scarlett starts to realize that the war isn't just an exciting, little game, and she meets Rhett Butler. During the siege of Atlanta, I held my breath, anxious to see what was next. Scarlett ends up marrying twice again and has 3 children Wade, Ella, and Bonnie.Excellent book! The movie was great too, though it left out some things. But if you want to read more details than the movie, read the book.",
            "Although this is the longest book I've ever read in my life (1024 pages in my edition), it wasn't long enough, and it never could be. I loved this book, and now that I've read it all i can say is that I'm glad there's a sequel. From the first few paes the book catches the readers and and wraps them up in it's pages, carrying them along with the life of Scarlett O'hara. We laugh with her, cry with her, feel her her emotions as if they were our own. You cannot stop thinking about the book, even though your mind should be on other things. The only desire is to keep reading and find out more, until the book finally lets go. Then the reader is left alone and confused, wondering what has happened, and where the story has gone. The book is a masterpiece, a novel in perfection, and my only regret is that this scale only goes from one to ten, for Gone With The Wind deserves a 100.",
            "First and foremost, Gone with the Wind has no mundane narratives, heartwarming and heart-rending from page 1 to 1448, 1448 was not enough!Brace thyself to be swept away by the Old South. If you heard this is a novel which glorifies racism and the age of slavery, you are misinformed; magnanimity is quite a virtue fellow savant.A captivating theme supported by characters with character, what more dost thou needeth? GWTW is a Pre-Civil War novel which portrays the monstrous adversities Southerners were manhandled to weather upon the slaughter of their civilization and way of life. For those attempting to prevail over a disheartening tragedy, GWTW shall inspire thee to walk the path of Rhett Butler or Scarlett O'Hara, for it once had for I (I, a former Ashley), though I held onto my chimerical nature. Wikipedia relays an excellent analysis of the characters, better than my own.People believe Southerners were fighting to defend slavery and the Confederacy, and I am sure a number of the arrogant wealthy landowners were, but the majority of Southerners were simply defending their homes and those they love. What would you do if an army was en route to your town and will pillage, burn, and commit unspeakable horrors unto your town's women, welcome 'em with open arms? Unlikely, unless you are gutless or a damn fool. You would, like I, commit monstrous acts to all extents, even if it were to leave you a corpse. I can go into historical detail debunking many fallacies people have about those who fought for the Confederacy, but it would serve little purpose, try reading the quote at the end of this review. GWTW is a Pulitzer Prize winner, it is doubtful that it would have been awarded such an honor if it were based on a horde of slack-jawed yokels praising slavery. GWTW is a novel of epic proportions, I highly recommend it.The 1939 film cannot compare in depth to the novel itself, but it is damn good for 1939. Clark Gable's performance was praiseworthy, such fiery passion, and Vivien Leigh, wow! What a powerhouse she is, almost intimidating, but in a cute classy way, if that makes sense, especially when she says \"I will not listen-\" (p. 1306)Memorable scene:Scarlett: [pleads with Rhett as he is about to leave to join the Confederate Army] Oh, Rhett! Please, don't go! You can't leave me! Please! I'll never forgive you!Rhett Butler: I'm not asking you to forgive me. I'll never understand or forgive myself. And if a bullet gets me, so help me, I'll laugh at myself for being an idiot. There's one thing I do know... and that is that I love you, Scarlett. In spite of you and me and the whole silly world going to pieces around us, I love you. Because we're alike. Bad lots, both of us. Selfish and shrewd. But able to look things in the eyes as we call them by their right names.Scarlett: [struggles] Don't hold me like that!Rhett Butler: [holds her tighter] Scarlett! Look at me! I've loved you more than I've ever loved any woman and I've waited for you longer than I've ever waited for any woman.[kisses her forhead]Scarlett: [turns her face away] Let me alone!Rhett Butler: [forces her to look him in the eyes] Here's a soldier of the South who loves you, Scarlett. Wants to feel your arms around him, wants to carry the memory of your kisses into battle with him. Never mind about loving me, you're a woman sending a soldier to his death with a beautiful memory. Scarlett! Kiss me! Kiss me... once...[he kisses her]Random quote from Gettysburg (1993):\"Virginians! Virginians! For your lands! For your homes! For your sweethearts! For your wives! For... Virginia! Forward... march!- Brigadier General Lewis Armistead",
            "I know, I know: another review of GWTW?Yes.Why? Because even after 72 years and billions of kudos, GWTW is still underrated. I was skeptical when I picked it up. But MM is one of the greatest writers of the 20th century, and she immediately hooks the reader. And she never lets up. And she spends the last third of the novel sucker-punching the reader over and over and over again, with each twist and turn more painful than the last. There's no one left to root for at the end of the book, and that's as it should be. Because it becomes clear that the characters in this novel (the adults, anyway) have all been playing a variety of dangerous games and, just like real life, they have to pay the price in the end.Scarlett is smart and courageous, but in the end she pays a price for her selfish behavior. Rhett is also smart and courageous, but at the end of the book he's a broken mess groping for his dignity and sanity. Melanie remains sane and dignified, but she's selfless to a fault (a characteristic which leads to her demise), and Ashley...well...This book makes me weep every time I read it. And yet I've read it at least 100 times. And keep coming back for more. Too bad all the sequels are so bad, but there's some fabulous fan fiction out there.",
            "I first read this book and saw the movie 35 years ago as a young teenager. Seeing that it was the 75th anniversary of the book, I decided to pick it up again. I am so glad I did. I didn't remember much about the book or movie after all these years.Mitchell did a fantastic job of describing people and settings. The story is about romance, family, survival, loss and determination. The characters are presented as real people with both good and bad points. Scarlett is manipulative and selfish for the most part but also loyal to her family when times are hard. Melanie is ever so sweet and innocent but we also see she is smarter than she first appears. Ashley is book smart and brave on the battlefield but is stuck in following the rules of conduct he has been taught his whole life. Rhett can be selfish and mean but deep down he really cares about people.I have lived in Georgia all my life. I grew up near Macon, where Sherman's troops marched. My 7th grade Georgia History teacher was a huge Civil War buff and made sure we learned more than just what was in the classroom history book. We saw the places the troops fought, we heard the stories handed down through the generations of the war, we read newspaper articles from that time period. Most of us were descended from people who experienced the war in their backyard. Often historical novels have twisted facts to fit the story, but the historical and geographical details of this book are accurate.For the critics who say this book is racist, you need to understand it is based on one view point of the south at that time. Not all Southerners owned slaves, very few owned plantations the size of the fictional Tara. Many slaves were mistreated, and of course owning another person is wrong. Rich whites did look down on poor whites. Whites did look down on blacks. But that is what happened at the time. The book isn't glorifying racism. It is just describing how a rich white family saw things during the 1860's in Georgia.Also, many of the men fighting were not slave owners but were just trying to protect their family. They did what most of us would do if we felt someone was coming to hurt and kill our families. Lincoln didn't set out to free the slaves. His main objective was to preserve the country as one entity.",
            "One of the best novels I've ever read. Margaret Mitchell has a way of bringing the reader into a tumulus period in the United States history. Near 1000 pages but easy to read and informative to what Southerners went through. Should be required reading in high schools of the U.S.",
            "I LOVE THIS BOOK!! Rhett Butler is one of the best characters when it comes to writing and so is Melanie, and Scarlett. Mitchell outdid herself in this classic novel. I love the movie too, but the book is much better with so much more detail. Yes, Scarlett is a little whiny and selfish and takes Rhett for granted, but I love her anyway! Ashley is a huge git, but you have to like a lot of the other characters inculding Aunt Pitty-pat and Melanie. This book is 5 Stars and nothing can change that. I hope Mitchell is smiling down from heaven when she sees us reading her book-because it is a true gem.",
            "Gone With the Wind is a classic novel of love and loss. Taking place in a time and place which is, quite literally, &quot;gone with the wind,&quot; it is interesting in both a historical sense and a romantic one. This novel is often called &quot;the greatest love story of all time,&quot; and truthfully at that. There is nothing quite as stirring as the interactions between Rhett and Scarlett. Margaret Mitchell's classic writing and understanding of times gone by makes this one of my (and the world's) ultimate favorites. At this point, this novel has reached so much fame that it is hardly necessary to discuss the plot, but for those uninformed out there, here it is:Scarlett O'Hara is the beautiful and headstrong eldest daughter of rich, high class plantation owners living just south of Atlanta during the antebellum period. Scarlett is the belle of the county - she has the smallest waist, the prettiest face, and the flirtiest personality. She could have any man, except the one she wants - Ashley Wilkes, who is already engaged to the frail but very sweet Melanie. When the Civil War breaks out everything changes. Scarlett marries, but is immediatly made a widow, and she moves to Atlanta to stay with Melanie. All the while Rhett Butler is lurking around. He's handsome, suave, and has a horrible reputation - hardly the kind of gentleman Scarlett was raised to like. But Scarlett, with her stubborn, headstrong attitude, brains, and independence is hardly a typical southern lady. As the war rages on, Scarlett's world is shattered and challenged. Wealth turns to poverty, pride to despair, admiration to dislike, and hate to love.Once started, this is a novel that cannot be put down. Many people read the whole thing (over 1,000 pages) in one very long sitting! That's what I did.",
            "I may just may be a 12-year-old girl, but when I read this book, I fell completely in love with it. I have the movie, an anthology and a paperback version that needs to be replaced after I find a hardcover version in stores. In a way it was better than the movie. It gave you a different idea about what Scarlett O'Hara was like and what she went through. It was and is just an excelent example of American history.",
            "I recieved Gone With the Wind as a Christmas gift and was not very excited about it. I had seen the movie and did not care for it, so I thought the book would problably be even worse--dragging on and on. I was so wrong. While not a quick read by any means, Gone With the Wind is completely fasinating. Everything about this book is perfect, from the characters to the events of the Civil War. Every character, especially the main characters, but even the minor characters, were wonderfully developed and real. I fell in love with each one. Scarlett and Rhett were written so honestly that, even in their wicked times, I could not help but love them. Melanie and Ashely as well were beautifully crafted. The story line is full of intimate, captivating details. Every scene is vital to the feel of the story and the final outcome. It has been several weeks since I finshed Gone With the Wind and I still find myself thinking about it and reliving it in my mind. There is a warning, however: When reading this book, do not read it from the the perspective of a person living in the 21st century. You must remember that our values have changed and, while definately for the better, the culture of Gone With the Wind should be judged on the basis of their own culture and morality, not our own. With that in mind, settle down for one of the most beautifully written and imaginatively creative books of our time.",
            "This book is just amazing. It is mind blowing. I loved it, I never wanted it to end. When I finally pulled myself away to eat or something I was dazed. I felt as though I were wearing glorious, beautiful dresses and corsets. The ending left me heartbroken. As fantastic and brilliant as this novel is, I both loved and hated the ending. It wasn't right as Scarlett and Rhett were made for eachother. So I read the sequal and although it could never match Maragret Mitchell, I was delighted to see Rhett and Scarlett together. It was though it had finally ended as I was far to curious and left hanging to leave it at the ending in Gone With The Wind. It is truly a masterpiece and I wish that Margaret had written the sequal, not alexandra and Margaret Mitchell was the only one who could really make the characters come alive as she did. I am only 15 but this novel makes the gentle, romantic days on the old South so appealing that I wish I knew what it was like to be there! For those who didn't like the sequal I find it hard to think that you didn't like the ending. It was just so hard to leave it with Rhett and Scarlett apart - him not loving her. Read Gone With the Wind than read the sequal Scarlett. Although Scarlett isn't great, it leaves you feeling pleased that they are together!",
            "I've read this book over and over again, and every time I finish I'm convinced that I'm never going to get tired of it. The story, although goes on forever (which think is okay, since I like to read, but many people I know complain abouth the lenght of the book) is so engrossing, so minutely descriptive and fascinating, even people who don't care for this kind of work will have at least to recognize the painstaking job of researching and piecing together the facts about American Southern life in the years of the Civil War. And the characters are something else. My absolute favorite literary heroine is Scarlett O'Hara, even if she was so stupid sometimes she made me desperate, and Rhett... well, sometimes I almost felt sorry for him, for all his macho-man behavior. Almost. You can't really feel sorry for a guy like this. And I loved the ending too, it was just right for the story. Anyway, I highly recommend this book to anyone, it deserves its reputation as a great classic, and by the way, so does the movie, even if it's not quite like the book, but that's to be expected, I guess.",
            "I have read Gone with the Wind in Chinese two times. I think that it is one of the best novels in the world. I was not only enjoying the beautiful language, but also learned the Civil War history. Magaret's characters showed me vivid and alive image. Especially Scarlett O'hara. Maybe, at the beginning of the book is not very interesting. But please continue you will find that you can not give it up. I love to talk about my feelings each time when I read it now. The first time I read it was in 1984. That time, I was a high school student, and reading famous novels was a popular thing to do. When my classmate and I met after summer vacation, they often asked me if I had read something interesting. I picked up Gone with the Wind. It is a huge novel, and there are too many foreigners. I couldn't remember all of the characters names. I couldn't figure out what happened. The only thing I could tell was that Scarlett was a very young girl and she loved to get the boys' attention. I just read one third of it because I was not interested in the love story. The second time that I read it was in 1991. I worked in a bank. My job was to count money. It was so boring when we had no money to count. So, I picked up the novel again. This time I could not give it up. Scarlett absorbed me. She was a spoiled, ruthless girl. She did everything she wanted to do and never thought about the consequences. I could see this from her first marriage. She didn't know if she really loved her husband. She already became Charles' widow and a boy's mother. During the civil war, Scarlett grew up. She had a very strong head. She was a brave lady. She saved her home from Sherman and the carpetbaggers. I think Scarlett was still too young to understand true love. Captain Butler said, &quot;I loved you but I couldn't let you know it. You're so brutal to those who love you, Scarlet. You take their love and hold it over their heads like a whip.&quot; When she recognized that she loved him so much too, it was already too late. Butler didn't trust her any more and didn't want to save his love with her. He left home. I cried for Scarlett. It was painful because their love story does not have a good end. But just because this end, Magaret moved thousands and thousands reader's hearts. I felt sadder than Scarlett did. I wouldn't know how to live without Butler's love. &quot;I'll think of it all tomorrow. After all, tomorrow is another day.&quot; Said Scarlett. That was Scarlett's way. I have learned a lot from her. I become brave and have a strong head after I read it. I can say Gone with the Wind is one of the best novels. It helps me have an excellent marriage. I think that young girls should read it and to learn be a brave and independent person. Finding true love and treating it as treasure is the effective method to have happy marriage.",
            "Scarlett is a complex woman...full of so many emotions that there is some of all of us in her. This book sets the plight of the Old South in an interesting fictional story...educating you without the feel of a textbook. You understand why the South tried like mad to hold onto its clearly outdated values and traditions. The struggle of the South becomes Scarlett's struggle with herself and the changing world around her. Then when you add Rhett Butler into the mix, off go the fireworks! This is truly a book that you have to read to appreciate. I don't enjoy romance novels or fiction that is too fluffy and this book has sometimes had those reputations. Not so...this book will grab you and never let you go.",
            "My mother is a huge fan of Gone With The Wind and for years she tried to get me to read it but I wouldn't because it's not the kind of thing I usually read. However, I finally read it when I was about 15 and I couldn't believe what I had been missing out on! Since then I have read it about a million times! The thing that makes Gone With the Wind so much better than your average romance is the wonderfully realistic characters. Considering she is the heroine Scarlett is not the nicest person in the world but that is what makes her so likeable! The same applies to Rhett Butler, who you can't help falling in love with even though he's not real! The book is sad, exciting and informative all at once and I can honestly say it is the best book I have ever read!!! The sequel &quot;Scarlett&quot; is almost as good in my opinion, though once you have read it, the ending to Gone With The Wind is spoiled. Anyway, if you haven't read either of these books yet, I recommend you read them now or you'll regret it like I did!",
            "I started to read this book as a challenge - to see if I could actually finish it. I did, finally, (after about a month) and was really impressed. Actually, I was quite sad at the end of the last paragraph. It was definetly a classic book, but I don't intend on reading it again anytime in the near future.Scarlett O'Hara is a great character. Though bull-headed, nasty, and insensitive, she comes off as a believeable southern woman post-Civil War. She apparantly has no feelings whatsoever for those who care for her most, that is, she doesn't find out how much people mean to her until the very last chapter of the book. Still, she is strong, stubborn, can be sweet, and can get whatever she wants. And yes, she is a believeable character. I simply can not stand people who use the excuse that the character was unbelieveable. How is that? By saying that, you're saying that there could'nt be anyone in the world with the same qualities as that person? I don't think so.The only thing that bothered me about this was the fact that Scarlett didn't give a rat's a** about her children. Much to the point where they were afraid of her. That fact just might make some people hate her.But, all other matters aside, I don't think I can express enough how much I loved this book. It was beautifully written, with the right word choice (they would talk in big words all the time, so I was thankful that I could actually understand them!) and such. I know some people hated this book, but that's their opinion. I don't know why there is even such a thing as reviews. You just have to read the book for yourself and don't trust what anyone else says. And don't spend all your time going into such detail about the plot. That thing with Rhett's mentioned but not explained son really has no relevance to the plot. If you spend all your time looking at the downsides of the story, you'll never enjoy it. But, I do hope that you enjoy this book, because I think it it really great.",
            "Great book. A must read, though whether or not you like it is up to you. I've loved this book since I was fourteen, and I think it is one of the best novels to ever come out of America.It drives me crazy when people say this book is racist. Really? A book written by a southerner, closely related to former slave owners? Racist? NO! The book is written about a south that the people of the south say and believed in, and the characters are all people who fit into this setting. This wasn't a story about enlightenment and aboltionism. It was a story about a woman in the south and the Civil War and reconstruction through her eyes. Not your eyes. Not the eyes of the northern aboltionists. Not the eyes of a slave. It was shown through the eyes of half the population of the US at the time, and that people try to nullify these views is wrong. This is the way people thought and felt, and villifying all slave owners (many of whom grew up in that society and didn't know much better) is no better than making all negroes stupid. In the end, it's a work of fiction. A book. Reading and enjoying it doesn't make someone a racist, and I would hope that people would please stop saying that. Don't like the book? Don't read it. I, for one, would say that books like \"The Wind Done Gone\" is no less racist, though there will be hell to pay if someone actually says it out loud.",
            "The summer I was 15, between Junior High and High School, my mother recommended that I read this book. Of course I wasn't going to listen to HER...so I pouted around for a few days, and then one evening, afraid I was going to succumb to utter boredom, I picked it up.For the next week, I did nothing but read Gone with the Wind. I read it every waking moment, far into the night, first thing in the morning. I remember having a perpetual headache from eyestrain. I simply could not stop until the last page, when I burst into tears, and sobbed for what seemed like hours.The book has much the same effect on me now. Every few years, I read it cover to cover, even though I can quote key passages by heart by this time. So let me tell you a little bit about Gone with the Wind, the first thing being that it is not what you think it is. It's hard to compete with David O'Selznick here, even though he's dead, but I beg you to put the movie aside, and prepare yourself for sheer, satisfying, bosom-heaving pleasure. This was a thoroughly amazing book in the thirties, and it wears well. It is much more than the story of spoiled, willful Scarlet O'Hara and her deadly flirtations. Scarlet may have been the first feminist. Women in her day had no power whatsoever. Their entire lives were decided by convention: whom they should marry, what they should eat, where they should live, what they should wear. But Scarlet would have none of it. And the only way she could break free of convention was to use her wiles to flaunt it. She did--and it worked. She was and is my hero, selfish and vain as she was.On quite another level, this is the heartbreaking story of the War Between the States from the Southern point of view. As a teen who was raised in California, I had no clue about how the South felt about the War, and no way to find out. This book, silly as some may find it, taught me that there are two sides to any conflict, two equally powerful and opposing points of view that are tragically at odds. Sound familiar? Not much different than the Middle East today.Now a word about the book's purported racism. Yes, there are slaves in this book, and I am not going to presume to tell you not to resent or be angry about that fact. But considering the time in which she lived, I think that Margaret Mitchell tried to deal with the issue of slavery as best she could. The slaves in the book are not the simpering fools of the movie. They are portrayed with as much dignity as I think Mitchell could manage when considering that there was no way she could condone OR ignore that slavery was a fact during the Civil War. Mammy is not a caricature in the book, Prissy is a much more sympathetic young woman, and the other slaves are portrayed as thinking, feeling, human beings.The Emancipation is not regretted, and is seen from the freed slaves' point of view as much as possible. That having been said, I am not advocating this book as something it is not. It is not an abolitionist work, and it is not anti-slavery per se. It is not anything more than phenomenally well-written story with a lot of truly interesting historical information about the 1860s and beyond.Gone with the Wind is the story of a lifetime, not the caliber of War and Peace, but for its time, incredibly good reading. Summer is almost upon us. This is a perfect time to sit under a magnolia tree with a mint julep and treat yourself to an old-fashioned story you'll never forget.",
            "I was 13 when I first read Gone with the Wind. It was a Chinese version. I couldn't remember who translated the book. All I could remember was that it was one of the most touching story I've ever read. I was encouraged by the Scarlett's passion and courage for life and touched by Rhett's patience and love.A few days ago, I picked up an English version of Gone of the Wind. It seems so much better than before. Maybe it's because that I'm now older and I can understand people's feelings in another dimension. Or maybe it's becuase I've moved to America and I had a better understanding of the western culture. I cried after reading it. I wish there was a different ending!",
            "What can I say about GWTW that hasn't already been said? The story is so captivating, and you can envision every scene because Margaret Mitchell describes every detail with such beautiful language. You really feel drawn back in time to the Old South and the Civil War. However, the characters are what really make the story so compelling, and the way they interact with each other is quite interesting because they are all so different. Scarlett O'Hara is probably one of the best literary characters ever created. She is very spoiled and self-centered, but I can't help but admire her strength and courage. There's also Rhett Butler, the handsome yet terribly scandalous man who loves Scarlett. Their relationship is definitely one of the greatest love stories ever written. You just have to read it! Don't be intimidated by the fact that it is over 1000 pages, the language is wonderful but not that complicated. If you haven't read this book, you're really missing out on a fantastic reading experience. Read it, and you will see why nearly seventy years after its initial publication, Gone With the Wind has not been forgotten.",
            "Just what the world needs. One more review of \"Gone With the Wind.\" I approached reading this book with a sense of trepidation. I looked at its 1,000+-page length, and doubted it was worth my time. I was afraid that it would be nothing more than an overblown historical romance novel. \"I'll think about it tomorrow\" summarizes the artistic merit of the book, I thought. Without the famous movie to sustain its reputation, who in their right mind would bother reading the book? Well, I was wrong. Looking beyond the soap opera of Scarlett, Rhett, and Ashley, I found things that really make this novel worthwhile. It's a richly detailed and historically accurate story of the Civil War and Reconstruction period, seen by those who bore the deprivations of daily life, not to mention the loss of loved ones. Although formatted as fiction, here we have living history. Margaret Mitchell draws deeply on her Georgia roots and gives the reader a uniquely Southern perspective of State Rights, slavery, Yankees, Carpetbaggers, Lincoln Republicans, and even the infamous Ku Klux Klan. Through the tribulations of Scarlett O'Hara, Mitchell argues that the Southern Cause appeared noble, but was ultimately foolish and futile. Above all, both Scarlett and Rhett Butler are practical people who doubt the sagacity of stifling social mores, and blind political affiliation. One can view Scarlett as the image of the South as she matures from a frivolous girl full of romantic notions into a strong, independent woman. Her pragmatism and steely resolve, forged on an anvil of personal suffering and survival, is another theme of the novel. It's easy to find the romantic melodrama of the surface plot distracting because it is fine entertainment. To enhance your reading pleasure, however, notice the rich historical detail and heed Scarlett's determination. As God is my witness, this is good reading. ;-)",
            "Going into this book, I was skeptical that I would enjoy it, as I am more into the Fantasy/Medievil genre. However, I don't know how anyone could not love this book. The characters are so real, the scenes so vividly described, and the feelings so profound that even I, someone not into the genre, couldn't get enough of it! Even though Scarlett was hostile towards loving Melanie, you couldn't help loving her! And I can actually see from the point of view of the Confederacy during the Civil War. It almost seems like their actions are justifiable, and we never learn this way of thinking in school! Over all, I have to say that Gone With the Wind lives up to it's reputation as one of the best novels of the 20th century!",
            "I first read this novel set during the Civil War when I was 12 years old. Shortly after that I was able to see the film version in an old downtown theater during one of its periodic rereleases. I was enthralled by both the novel and film. Is there anyone out there who doesn't know the plot? For the 10 people in the world who don't know, it features Scarlet O'Hara, a Southern belle, living that role to the hilt on her family's Southern, slave-worked plantation, when all hell breaks loose with the Civil War. Admirable for her survivor qualities, Scarlet is also manipulative and ruthless but meets her match in Rhett Butler, a Southerner who manages to move profitably among both sides of the War while most of the South is starving. I reread this novel as an adult, expecting that with my many more years of reading since that first read, that I would find the book over the top and soap opera like. It didn't happen. I couldn't put it down and had every bit as fascinating a time reading it again as I did the first time. If you haven't given it a reread in many a year, try it yourself and you'll be very pleasantly surprised.",
            "I have been reading &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; every couple of years since I was first &quot;allowed&quot; to read it at the age of 14! (In those days our mothers had higher hurdles for &quot;appropriate&quot; reading). When I was younger, I read this book once every year. I actually learned to read French without a dictionary by reading the French translation. (It's long enough to have that kind of linguistic influence! )The story of Scarlett O'Hara, a feisty and courageous southern &quot;belle&quot; whose beauty and sharpness was complicated by a lack of insight into human nature that ultimately left her unable to understand the hearts of those she most loved and by whom she was loved, until it was too late. It is also the story of the the South just before, during and after the Civil War.A more sympathetic portrait of the South than many other Civil war histories, it has aged fairly well, despite a slightly more patronistic view of African-Americans than one might be comfortable with today. Given its authorship dating back to the 1930s, I believe one needs to look at the book in the context of its historical period, and not to demean its historical or entertainment value simply because we are more aware and more sophisticated after the Era of Civil Rights in the United States. I also believe a sympathetic and well-educated person such as the author Margaret Mitchell seems to be, would have been the first to agree had she lived long enough to undergo that period of transformation in our country.Despite this limitation, few books of historical fiction are so well-plotted, and few characters in literature are so well-developed as that of Scarlett O'Hara, Rhett Butler, or Ashley and Melanie Wilkes--people I continue to feel like I &quot;knew&quot; in another time.The story is also that of Atlanta, a city which was relatively young and &quot;brash&quot; as a Confederate economic and cultural center, relative to Charleston and Richmond, the more sedate Confederate capitals.The book is valuable both as a historical text for those of us with little insight into the viewpoint of the South beyond that given in grade school textbooks, and as one of the most romantic dramas in American literature.I enjoyed reading this book as much at the age of 48 as I did almost 35 years ago (and many times in-between). I can't imagine a better summer read for a teenage girl, or a better way to relax at the beach for her mother, or a better way to pass a cold snowy vacation in front of a fire. Definetely a book for the romantically inclined.One should also note, that &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is one of the few books (until perhaps &quot;Cider House Rules&quot;) portrayed almost as well on film as the book is written. However the pleasures remain different and self-contained, and no enjoyment of either is lost by viewing or reading the other.",
            "This book is the best thing I've ever read in my life! The details are fantastic and the characters are well portrayed. The storyline is classic! This book immediately sucks you into the story and makes you really care about the characters in it. It made me laugh, it made me angry, it made me cry, and most of all it made my heart melt. I think this is the finest book ever written.",
            "Within the one thousand and twenty-four pages of this book, a reader is allowed to experience hardships, heartbreaks, shocking revalations, and most of all, an overwhelming emotionally-charged, intense book. This is one great book! Characters come alive, colors form before the eye of your imagination, shapes and sounds seem to ring in your ears, and undeniable passion sets fire to your heart. If you haven't read this experience of a lifetime, you are missing out on one of America's most treasured, true, and honest classics. (Those nights you will spend reading late into the hour and the tiredness of the next day are definatly worth it:)",
            "This was the best book I read in a while. Even though it is long, it is a beautiful love story of Scarlett O'Hare and Rhett Butler. It is a learning experience for all readers. A must read! I can't wait to read Scarlett: The Sequel!",
            "I read it when I was 11 and my opinion was, and still is, &quot;pretty good, for a romance.&quot; But it's probably just me, because I'm more into science fiction and mythology. bit of a difference, isn't it? P.S.- if you really liked GWTW, don't read the sequel, _Scarlett_. I'll tell you, it's pretty different from what I imagined.",
            "Even though I am only thirteen, I am still able to grasp the grandeur of this novel. It is truly one of a kind.",
            "This book is extraordinary! It is truly a brillant piece of literature. To any one who has never read this book, you need to read it. The movie is good, but the book is so much better!Scarlett O'Hara is the epitome of a selfish, spoiled brat . . . but you just gotta love her",
            "Margaret Mitchell was my Great-Great Aunt. From her, I inherited some of my facial characteristics,and also a talent for writing. I first read my aunts book when I was in 7th grade, and fell head over heels in love with it. It was a story that depicted the life from a southern point of view. In a vast majority of the Civil-War era novels, the Confederates are made out to be unruly rebels. Not ALL southerners were like that. Take The O'Hara family for example,did not treat their slaves badly, as many southern plantation owners were made out to be. I'm not denying the act of slavery as being horrible, for I know that it was, but at the same time, Margaret showed both sides. She showed the hardships and difficulties, loves and pleasures of southern life, and for that I am unbelievable proud to say that I am her blood.",
            "Not a bad novel for a first writer. It could almost be a classic except for a few points - a) it's unecessarily long and could have used more editing; b) the second half is weak and not very interesting; c) it's description of Reconstruction is very one-sided and half-correct and d)it's too racist. Other than that, it's not bad.",
            "I love Gone with the Wind! It is a beautiful and wonderful story to read over and over again!",
            "About twenty years ago, when I was a teenager, I read this book, here in Brazil.Today, I don't like to read any kind of fiction, but remembering what I thought then, I have to give four stars for it.Another american author of fiction, Sidney Sheldon was nothing, compared to the american woman that wrote this book.Good, but too long, fiction.Good art doesn't gets older.",
            "It took a long time to read, but it was very good. Unfortunately, there are certain parts that I do not recommend in it that are a little inappropriete (between Rhett and Scarlett). Margaret Mitchell portrayed a beautiful story in this book though! :)",
            "Gone with the wind is the best book i have ever read!! It was so awesome!! Its my favorite book ever!!",
            "This book is absolutely the best. You would have to be a fool not to enjoy this book. It is beautifully written, and extremely enjoyable. Its length is an excellent support, for if you are hungry for more, it is always coming. READ THIS BOOK AND YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPOINTED!",
            "I picked up this book from the library when I was only 11. Every time I read a book I have a new fave book,but this book is my very favorite. Scarlett O'Hara may be an absolute brat, but I love her. She's got spunk and sprit!Melanie is such a sweet charachter! Rhett is imposible, but hysericaly funny! This book takes you through 12 years of Scarlett's life. It is funny, touching, and very real. When I read this book, I laughed,pondered over certain ideas, and cried. This is an iresistible romance, which teaches leasons about life and love. I recomended this book to any one!",
            "This book is a very interesting one. Me being 14 years old, I didn't think I was going to like it at all because I'm not the fondest person of reading. But I found it very interesting, and easy to follow most of the time. It took me back to the time of the Civil War, and I felt I was actually there. I would recommand this book to amyone. Especially ones that are interested in Historical-Ficiton.",
            "Scarlett O'Hara is the ultimate survivor. She has more inner strength and passion than any man or woman in the story except, of course, for Rhett Butler. &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; is the kind of book that you don't just read; you actually live the story, and when you finish reading the last page, you are bereft because you miss the characters so much. The characters are so clearly defined you feel that you know them. The story of the finely detailed lives of every single character, told against the background of some of the most romantic, disburbing, and turbulent years of American history, is unparalled. It is a great tribute to Margaret Mitchell that her only published work is loved and revered by so many. Anyone who thinks he knows the story of &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; from seeing the movie is sadly mistaken. This story MUST BE READ to be truly appreciated!",
            "I not only have one dog earred copy of this book, I have two dog earred copies of this book on my nightstand. What a great book! Inspiring, thoughtful and interesting all at that same time. Yes, there are racist elements and sterotypical themes (the use of the \"n\" word is discusting and offensive and the view that the slaves were \"Happy\" was absolutely discusting). The issue of slavery was sugar-coated - the slaves were never depicted as being human beings with thoughts and feelings - they were just charactures meant to serve their Caucasian \"masters\". I enjoyed reading about the historical aspect of the Civil War. The characters of Scarlett and Rhett do not pretend to be something they are not - both are shrewd, focused, fiesty. Is Scarlett a spoiled little brat? Yes, of course she is, but somehow the author makes you want to root for her in the end because Scarlett fights for what she wants and never gives up. I think those are admirable qualities for any person to have.I agree with other posts that there was no reason for a sequel(s). The sequel really served no purpose other than to confirm what (most) of us already knew or hoped - that Scarlett and Rhett would end up together anyway.",
            "I think everyone either loves or hates this book-so here I'm just going to say that I love this book, and I really believe it is one of the finest novels ever written. Yes, it portrays black slaves as their owners saw them in the Civil war-as inferior people. But would it really have been historical fiction if it had been any other way? This is not just a novel about Scarlet and Rhett Butler-this is a book about the pre-civil war way of life in the South and the way the real southerners, the ones who lost their slaves and plantations and had to make a major adjustment on their viewpoints on race, lived. Scarlet and Rhett and Melony and Ashley-they are some of the best written characters ever created. And no, you shouldn't be able to understand their mindset. They lived a hundred and fifty years ago and no one today has a mindset like that. Good historical fiction should always put you in a mindset that it hard to understand and relate to-because otherwise it's just a character in the past with a modern mindset.Read this book if you want to know true history. The way the war is portrayed is gruesome and terrible, but like a car wreck you can't look away. The writing shows the true effect it has on the lives it touched and the horrible way it changed and damaged all the people who lived through it. It is fascinating, impeccably written as far as the historical facts go, and also romantic and enjoyable. I read this book every year and every time I love it. If you like historical fiction, read this book. If you like history, read this book. Even if you think this book is raciest and terrible, read the book. Understand a different viewpoint on history.Besides, the author was not a raciest at all. This is FICTION folks.This is the ultimate historical fiction, and every one should read it. From page one you will be trapped.So much more than five stars.",
            "Having just watched the movie recently after many years, I realized anew how wonderful the book is in comparison! Scarlett is more than just a money-hungry b****, Rhett is *much* more than the wimp who kept telling her he loved her in the movie, etc.I love GWTW because it's one of the few books that remains true to its characters. A happy ending was never possible for Rhett and Scarlett, because she saw him as more scoundrel than soul mate until the very end. He put up with *more* than enough from her before his love gave out, and he hid that love from her except on two memorable occasions.This is an interesting portrait of the South, and in turn, of Marget Mitchell herself. The racism in this novel never bothered me, because she was simply seeing life through the filter of her own life and experiences. Things were so different back then; how can anyone judge from today's perspective?I'd recommend this book to anyone. I read it first when I was 11 years old, but so much of the adult content and nuances went over my head that I wouldn't recommend this to children.",
            "Gone With The Wind is no doubt THE classic Civil War novel. However, the major characteristic that enables it to achieve its greatness also condemns Scarlet to a life of unrequited love and dooms her potential for happiness with Rhett. That attribute is that it is written entirely from the woman's viewpoint.The perspective is a strength because it permits the author to vividly portray the destruction of Southern society better than any battlefield-centered novel could. Regrettably, it also leaves the author, and therefore Scarlet as well, incapable of understanding the male characters. They are merely personalities that fade in-and-out of the background to shape the narrative. While they are characters that can stand up off the page and cast a shadow, there is no tone or timbre in their images.For example, Rhett notes that he was nearly killed stealing the horse to get Scarlet out of Atlanta before it was burned. But Mitchell does not describe the theft. Therefore, Scarlet (and Mitchell herself) cannot appreciate Rhett's ordeal or gain true insight into his character.In another instance the novel mentions that Rhett fought at the battle of Franklin. What Mitchell does NOT tell the reader is that Franklin was probably the bloodiest defeat of a Confederate army in the entire war. For Southern arms its horrors are unmatched by any of the better known battles in Virginia or elsewhere. Mitchell fails to narrate this experience and thereby misses yet another opportunity understand and appreciate Rhett.In short, since Mitchell herself failed to share much of Rhett's (or any man's) experiences, the chances that Scarlet could find true love were as slim as an Apache Indian getting elected Pope. Mitchell and Scarlet sought only to be understood and not to understand.",
            "This classic Civil War-era romance novel won the Pulitze Prize in 1937 and was made into the classic movie audiences around the world know and love two years later. This terrific saga begins before the Civil War (which the Union won four years later, paving the way for the 14th Amendment, which ended slavery in 1865, several months after Abraham Lincoln's assassination) and ends during Reconstruction. I won't go over the plot again, as many who've either read the book or seen the movie (or both) know what it's about. Those who haven't read it, read the editor's reviews. One major difference between the book and the movie is that the book has a lot of cursing and the movie only has one swear word: \"Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn.\" The way Rhett (Clark Gable, who won Best Actor in 1934 for the delightful screwball comedy \"It Happened One Night\"; review coming soon) says that to Scarlett (Vivien Leigh, in the role that won her her 1st Academy Award for Best Actress; the 2nd one was also for Best Actress in \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" in 1954) makes it seem like it's not a bad word at all. Watch the movie AFTER reading the book, you'll appreciate it more. The book is rated PG-13 for intense thematic elements, strong vulgar language, mild war violence, some images of wounded, violence, intense domestic conflict, mild sensuality and brief nudity. The movie is rated G.SCARLETTEveryone expected a sequel to \"Gone With The Wind,\" but those hopes went up in smoke when Margaret Mitchell died in 1939, the same year the classic movie (see my review on it) came out and three years after it was published. Imagine how surprised I was when I found out about the sequel, advertised on the back cover of the Large Print Edition that I borrowed countless times from my local library before buying it from \"Doubleday Book Club\" (rarely do they have anything worth buying). Alexandra Ripley (who is she?) wrote this follow-up with the \"Permission\" of the Mitchell Estate and look at the result. True, the story picks up where the original left off, but a twist of the supernatural (what the hell was she thinking?!!) just ruined the novel. It too was turned into a movie starring Joanna W.-Kilmer and Timothy Dalton (two-time James Bond in \"The Living Daylights\" and \"Licence To Kill\" [see my reviews on them]), which I don't know if it's any good. Ripley got some things right (adding more backstory to Rhett, etc), but she completely missed the mark on others (killing Mammy off, what the devil were you on, cocaine?) It's good reading if you want to find out what happens between Rhett and Scarlett, one of the most famous love affairs in literature, but if you expect the sequel to be as good as the original, don't bother. The novel is rated PG for some violence, mild language and brief nudity.GONE WITH THE WIND:5 starsSCARLETT:2/1/2 stars",
            "(that is if it takes 6 weeks to read... so you better start reading!!!)In a word... you will RELIVE Scarlett's experience and she will become a person to you :) If you are a person who likes drama and human emotion, then this is the book for you! The fact that it is set against the chaotic background of the American Civil War is just an added bonus since the real storyline of the book is the tale of a woman's struggle against time and change when her world is falling apart.",
            "This book is my favorite. I have read it straight through a few numerous times, but my favorite thing to do is just pick it up and let the pages fall open. It's the kind of book you can do that with. I love the emotion the characters show, and especially what they hide, waiting for you to find out. The vitality of the Old South meeting with the views of one courageous woman and those both behing her and against her is amazing. Scarlett O'Hara , Rhett Butler, and the others are characters never to be forgotten, immortalized forever by Margaret Mitchell.",
            "GWTW has many flaws -- the political views of the book can be most kindly described as &quot;naive,&quot; and its racism is apparent on virtually every page. The second half of the book feels rushed; once Mitchell has actually united Scarlett and Rhett, she no longer seems to write them with the same imagination and humor. All that said, this is the quintessential blockbuster -- not a deep book by any means, but entertaining in ways most novels or movies could never dream of being. Mitchell has a gift of creating fantastical situations for her characters -- and making them seem not only believable but unevitable. The characterization is stronger than is generally realized; Scarlett, Rhett, and Ashley all have layers of complexity that far more &quot;literary&quot; novels often fail to create. It's part of pop culture, and American culture, and for all its flaws and frustrations, an endlessly enjoyable and memorable read.",
            "some people should just shut their mouths. Gone with the Wind was the best book ever written!!! I read it in a week when i was fifteen and fell in love. I had seen the movie seven times before i had read the book. After i read the book though, i became completely obsessed with Gone With the wind, i bought the book and the movie, and have been hunting for any pictures, quotes and reviews. Gone With the Wind- it's not only one of the best books i have ever read, it's an obsession, it's my life.By the way, to those who thought that Gone with the Wind was a ridiculous read because of the length, they can go and get a brain. Good books have a lot of depth to them, and they need all the extra pages they can get. Gone With the Wind is not all about trash, as an underimaginative few found it. It's not only an overdramatic love story, it's not only another one of those American civil war stories. It's really about the complexity of human emotions, feelings, and the way people handle obstacles and life,consequences of actions and emotions and also about certain people and their mutual understanding of each other. When i finished GWTW for the very first time, i continued to think about the extra depth in that book which i just couldn't understand. I read the book several times more, and also began reading in between the lines. In the end i discovered that Magaret Mitchell was an absolute genius. She was no where near the trashy romance writer many had portrayed her to be- she was a realist. She was actually writing about how human spirit and determination, how it can be applied to help one over such obstacles. For those who say there was no depth to gwtw ought to read the book again. Perhaps they read the book to fast for their own benefits, it's such a shame because it only denotes what shallow and uneducated people they are, not being able to understand truly what an amazing conquest Margaret Mitchell had achieved.",
            "I have read this book many times over the years and decided having it on my Kindle would keep it available for reading anytime I wanted and now I may even read it more often.",
            "It doesn't get any better that Gone with the Wind. I have read it in book form at least three times. Seen the movie so many times",
            "I read this book at least once a year! It is so easy to get lost in the pages and Margaret Mitchell does an amazing job making you feel like you're actually there! Love it!",
            "When I first read Gone with the wind many years ago at age 25, I had watched the movie many times and loved it. Then when I read the book, I fell in love with it hailing it as the best book I'd ever read in my life. At that time though, I did find the in depth descriptions of the surroundings and of backgrounds of people a little tedious. Other than that, I loved it and my lifelong love of Civil War history was started right then and there. As the years went by and I read so many more books, a few years ago there began to be other books that took the title of \"best book\" in my eyes, always keeping that great love of GWTW in my heart. However, at age 52, I decided to read it again. It just called to me for some reason. This time, I loved it even so much more than I did then, and what I disliked about it years ago, the descriptive writing of Margaret Mitchell, is one of the things I loved about it most of all. It takes a tremendous amount of talent for a writer to totally immerse the reader into the setting they have created, when they can just see the lush beauty, the red clay, the desolation, the dying wounded, everything that was written, you lived it, smelled it, and felt it. I was in this story from beginning to end, and I lost myself in it completely. It now has rightfully taken its place as my favorite book of all time.Yes, It is a book where the main character is a selfish, spoiled rich plantation owner's daughter, that lost everything she had that she knew in the world, her home, her parents, many friends, her money, and how she clawed herself back to the top no matter who she ran over or hurt along the way. She is an unlikeable character that you cannot help but like anyway for the sheer will and determination she has to survive. Somewhere along that road of selfishness, she developed a conscience even though she stifled it whenever it reared it's head and went on being ruthless anyway. Also somewhere along the road, she realized that there was a feeling she could not quite identify in her heart about Melanie and Rhett, a feeling she did not realize was love until it was too late to enjoy that love. Oh you knew she was ruthless and hard, but you knew there was some good in her somewhere (was there?) and you rooted for her.Then there's Rhett. The rebellious, sarcastic, making money at the ruin of others, handsome man that fell in love with her the moment he cast eyes upon her. He was there for her so many times over the years, but she never really appreciated him. He loved her so much, but never let on in words that he did because he knew anyone that admitted they loved her, she would run over like she did so many other poor men that loved her, may they rest in peace. She realized she loved him much too late.There's Melanie, the mild, sweet shy girl-like woman who Scarlett said she hated because she was Ashley's wife (and of course Scarlett was in love with Ashley). So sweet and mild, she has a fierce loyalty and love for Scarlett, which Scarlett also didn't fully realize until it was too late.And Ashley, poor pitiful Ashley who she just thought she loved all these years only to finally realize she was In love with an idea of him, not him. She wasted all those years not realizing this, again, until it was too late.Mixing with all these wonderful characters and more, is a story about the south and how the world they knew was lost. Though it was a world that had many wrongs that should not have happened and that I'm glad was put an end, you can't help but feel their loss, feel the horror as they watched their houses and Atlanta burn to the ground. You feel their hungriness as they have nothing to eat, feel their shame as they have nothing but rags left to wear, feel their bitterness as they are under Yankee rule during the reconstruction.It's also a story about what different people do to survive. In this case, does one go with the flow and make the best out of a new situation and reap the benefits that they can in the situation they're in, or does one stay loyal to a cause that was burned to the ground and is no more and stay humbled and hungry? Does one sell their soul and prosper at the cost of others? Scarlett took advantage of the situation she was in and it made no difference who she ran over to do it or if she did forget the cause for which a war was fought. However, in the end, I think she realized that to have all she acquired, a very high price was paid for it all.This book was so great on so many levels, even more that what I've written here. For to go on, it would be way longer that this. I think it's a masterpiece.I do want to say one more thing, last but not least, about the author Margaret Mitchell. Though this was her only published novel, she did not drop down out of the sky to write this book out of nowhere. Growing up she wrote complete stories all the time as a little girl, was in drama at school, and as a young adult, worked as a journalist until she had to quit due to an ankle injury. She was born into a family rich in civil war history and many of her family had actually fought and lived during the civil war and she sat on many a lap listening to these stories throughout her childhood. She was born, lived and died in the city she wrote about, Atlanta. She knew of what she wrote about and it's historically accurate. She died, unfortunately, at the age of 48, hit by a drunk driver, crossing Peachtree St. (a street mentioned many times in the book), with her husband on the way to the movies. 5 days later she died, she was buried in Oakland Cemetary, (a graveyard mentioned in the book). To me, this book could have never been surpassed and I feel so good knowing that in her short life, she chose to leave this masterpiece for us all to enjoy forever. I, for one, am grateful. Thank you Margaret Mitchell.",
            "I have read Gwtw at least 3 times in the past. Somehow I lost my book ina move, and saw it for sale on Amazon, and couldn't wait for it to comein the mail.I was very pleased to receive it in excellent condition ! Even though Ihave read it 3 times before, it intrigues me, and I can't put it down.I love the characters Rhett Butler and Scarlet O'Hara. I have the sequelScarlet and find that book is also very enjoyable, However NOT as muchas Gone with the wind. I will never loose my book again. I'm passing itdown to family who I hope will make this a keepsake.thanks. katie",
            "I have absolutely loved this movie from the first moment I watched it (want to say I was 6 or 7!). I finally sat down to read the book and while it took me a loooong time to finish it, I couldn't put it down. I see now why this book is so controversial, even today still. I love how things that didn't make sense, or you just wanted more of, in the movie went more into detail in the book. Melly dying, the chaos that Rhett and Scarlett went though when Bonnie died, how Scarlett landed Frank. Very good book indeed!",
            "It's an ok story until after the war and then how they turn on the poor old masters and blah, blah, blah... pure southern womanhood all a-fearin' them free black men going around crazy raping... oh come on Margaret, where did you do your research?Just too much of it... and I'm not really so sure Scarlet is so bad, she seems the only one capable of doing the work it takes to get the whole family out of all the scrapes they are in... so what's wrong with that???Well, must consider when it was written I suppose... next I'm reading &#34;Uncle Tom's Cabin&#34; to get the bad taste out of my mouth.",
            "I was one of those who disappeared for a few days until I finished the book. A great, spellbinding novel. With that said, the history in the book is terrible. This is such a warped perspective on slavery; it is history through the eyes of Simon LeGree. We are supposed to believe that the slaves really loved \"Massa\", instead of being kept in place by the lash, the chain, and the gun. Further, the Reconstruction governments in the South did some great things. The South has done an excellent job of rewriting history to make themselves look good. This novel is unfortunately the basis for many people's view of history of these times. We are supposed to feel bad that the \"glorious\" days of the slave plantation are \"gone with the wind.\"",
            "I am sorry , but I did not like Gone With The Wind(I am a senior in highschool and despite what everyone thinks about highschoolers, I am well read. And I have read books by James A Michener and John Jakes). I will admit that Scarlett has an amazing ability to survive, but it is only by her own selfishness that she does. I would rather read a different book about the civil war that contains better people than Scarlett. I feel sorry for the men that fall in love with Scarlett and I feel sorry for Scarlett because the one man she loves is lost to her. I do not believe in pining after something one cannot have, it wastes a lot of time and is too much wasted emotion. Even though I do not like Scarlett, I do appreciate the facts that Mitchell worked in about the civil war, such as the burning of Atlanta and what happened when the former slaves were given the right to vote and hold office. All in all, Gone With The Wind is an O.K. book, if you do not mind inconclusive endings and selfish people.",
            "The book was well written but personally I liked the movie better. Yes the book was about many things but the part that urked me was the romanticized view of the South's struggle with \"the low class treacherous Yankees\" and the so called uppity negroes. Oh how insolent and thirsty these \"brutes\" were for any thing white in a dress (southern propaganda of the reconstruction era and of Mitchell's own era.) Mitchell leaves out the fact that almost every Southern slave owner was himself only a gentleman during the day but at night was more treacherous to black womanhood than any \"darky\" ever was to that of white womanhood. Unfortunately many Americans know very little about history and therefore will sadly accept the lies and fantasies that Mitchell's book has exposed our society to. As I stated earlier, it was well written and I took great pains to read it in its entirety waiting for the point in which Mitchell's account of the South would be fair and balanced (since the movie wasn't so bad) but unfortunately it seemed Mitchell really believed that blacks who had been stolen from their homeland, whipped for not picking someone else's cotton fast enough, raped by their masters, abused by jealous mistresses were supposed to turn around after being freed and say \"thankee Massuh fo' all dat ya dun dun fo' me.\" Thank goodness for Alex Haley's Roots!",
            "As angela camack pointed out, the film &quot;gone with the wind represents the institution of slavery as a walk in the park. The fact that the movie lasted over a period of years and it rarely showed a violent act towards a Black person is solid proof. The truth of the matter is that slavery in the deep south, likes places such as south carolina, was incredibly brutal and violated most human rights. The film attempted to depict slavery as a life where none of the slaves got beaten, whipped or raped, when in reality violent acts towards Black individuals was a common day occurrence. According to Frederick Douglass slaves were beaten weekly to strike fear into the other slaves. Women were raped continually over years of their lives in order to perpetuate the institution of slavery. Families were torn apart from each other due to the trading and selling of slaves. Gone With the Wind could have done a little more justice to Black Americans by not under emphasizing the torture and pain that they endured during the 19th century.Apart from its ignorant illusion of slavery the movie does illustrate, as Mark Burgh points out, the hardships of post Civil War life in the south. Scarlett O'Hara never had to do a thing for herself before the war. By the time Sherman was done marching to the sea she had made up her mind that she was going to conform to the new northern way of life in order to survive under the new politic. A lot of people in the south had to make that change, and I think that movie does an excellent job of showing the changes in life style before and after the war",
            "but it works, mainly because of Scarlett and Ashley, who are engaging if limited characters. Rhett Butler begins as interesting but is ultimately tiresome. Mammy is engaging, Prissy less so. The less said about Melanie and Ellen the better. Don't count on it as history lesson, either. Really, it's not much more than a well written bodice ripper (which explains why it has so many adolescent fans) but bodice rippers are often fun.",
            "Margaret Mitchel wrote only one book in her life. \"Gone With The Wind\" not only won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1935, but the film version won Best Picture in 1939 - opposite \"The Wizard of Oz\". Mitchel never wrote again, though in the mid 1940's she was struck by an automobile on Peachtree Street in Atlanta and her body was dragged for more than 100 feet.Her fiuneral was more majestic than Scarlet and Rhett's wedding.a signed first edition of this book today is worth well over $15,000.As for the new introduction written by Pulitzer Prize winner, Pat Conroy (\"The Prince of Tides\") He is, after all a Southern Writer and his own material is considered literature. I'll leave his words up to you. I respect his work a great deal. Even if not his opinion. And that's all an intorduction or a review is; a critic attempts to establish crredability with words. and in seeking out a Soutern Writer, though there are dozens of well qualified women writers (Lett's, Flagg, Kingsolver) With Styron, Clemens and Faulkner gone we are left with Conroy and John Grisham. I'd be interested to know what all of these people would write in an introduction.\"Gone With The Wind\" is a terrific story, fairly well written and highly emotional. It is one of the few war novels in history written from a woman;s perspective (that includes battle scene action) and the character of Scarlet O'Hara- our protaganist and ingenue - has become an adjective in describing other characters. In some ways, this novel; is a huge step forward for the feminist movement, but far more so it set the civil rights movement back subsgtantially and continues to every single time someone reads it. People read that book and actually believe that slaves were treated like family members. Mitchell writes about Mammy and Poke and Prissy passing along the perfumed hearsay her grandmother told her that the \"houise darkys\" are given \"family status\" but still Scarlett's frustration over Prissy's idlesness causes her to threaaten to break a switch acorss her back. Miss Scarlet runs into Big Sam as the Confederate Army leaves Atlanta to the Yankees while Scarlet must stay to bring Melly's baby (A love promise she made to Melly's husband)He is a Field Hand but she speaks with him because he is an overseer and only becausee the Yankee's canons and guns can be heard on the hprizon. She gaters information and does not wish him well;she will never see him again and as readers we never hear of him again. Neither the book nor the film do anything to expose what slavery was and the way in which \"Gone With The Wind\" has injured the rights for descendents of America-slaves is sinceely nauseating.There are millions who would break a switch across my back for this review. I saw go to it,k but you'd better re-read thge book before you do it. Perhaps watch the film as well, as it is less harsh than the book. (I own the screenplay)So by all means, everyone should read \"Gone With The Wind\". The more controlversial, the more one should read. But before you do, read Alice Walker's \"The Color Purple\" which also won the Pulitzer Prize. I've taught these books together as WAlker's also takes place in the South in 1935 and gives a clear idea of what life was like for the once-slaved,now impoverished. Thern read GWTW. After you get all teary and warm with \"Gone With The Wind\"(and you will be) then you must read William Styron's \"The Confessions of Nat Turner\", also a Pulitzer Prize winner, which was written in 1966, utilizerd what little is known of the trial of Nat Turner and tells us more truth about what it was to be a slave. If after that you still haven't gotten the picture pick up the recently published book about Paul Jennings, \"A Slave in The White House\"- the book that first speaks of a black man in the oval office, only he was dusting it, pouring drinks for President Madfison and he was, in truth, the one who rescued the lifesized portrait of George Washington. (Dolley Madison was a selfish, nasty woman who became frighened of her 104 slaves after President Madison died; oit is a fact, that during her lifetime at Montpieler after James died, Nat Turner's revolt occured and in New England the ship \"Amistad\" was overturned. For so many of us, fiction is a way to step into the minds and souls of another person in another world. With \"Gone With The Wind\" you run the risk of emerging a bigot.",
            "This is a great love story with more than a smidgen of insight into the human psyche, but it is also an offensive apologia for the American Original Sin--slavery. This is our Wagner. If you read it in public, don't forget the brown paper bag.",
            "I only knew the story from the movie, so I bought this book the week before we invaded Iraq, I'm sure at some subconscious level to read a viewpoint about war. The first half of the book was ok, I liked the descriptions of the suffocating constraints of upper class society at the time and Scarlett's rejection of them. The devastation of war and the struggle that Scarlett and her family went through were powerful. However, the second half of the book completely turned me off to the story. Margret Mitchell's descriptions of the reconstruction were so vile I almost put the book down. Blacks were only happy being slaves, they were too stupid for anything else. The only good blacks in the book are the ones who can serve the whites. Big Sam says he had enough of freedom and wants to go back to Tara. He's even incredulous that while in the north whites wanted him to sit at the dinner table with them like he was their equal, but he couldn't do it because he is not the equal to whites. Mitchell actually says that he smiles and feels better when Scarlett starts to tell him what to do because someone is telling him what to do again. Mitchell also uses animal metaphors when describing the black characters.At one point Mitchell is describing how the southern whites hate the Yankees so much because the Yankees have money and food and power and they do not, yet she doesn't have any sense of irony to see that the whites are in the position that they put the slaves in for centuries.And another thing that I did not like about the book is that most of the characters are serious sociopaths. They kill anyone who breaks their rules of racial propriety. Rhett kills a black man for being \"upity\" to a white woman, another character, one of the Fontaine boys, kills a black man for for saying something to a white woman. We are not told what but it is pretty obvious it was sexual, so we have the sterotype of the black male sexual prowler. Then the same Fontaine boy kills Jonas Wilkinson for telling black men that they are equal to whites and that they are alowed to have white women!! He doesn't just kill him, he cuts him to ribbons with a knife. There are many more examples of this psychotic behaviour. And Mitchell treats these behaviors as if they are to be admired. While reading I kept thinking these people are all nuts. I was glad they suffered and I'm glad they lost the war. I lost any sense of caring about what happened to any of them, including Scarlett.Also, this is a very anti-American book. Mitchell keeps going on about how awful the Yankees and the Union and the federal government are and how great Georgia and states rights are. Of course, states rights here means being able to murder anyone who annoys you. The reconstruction section of the book should be read by everyone just to show why the flying of the Confederate flag is so offensive. It is completely un-American.And one last thing. This isn't a great love story. Rhett is really only a supporting character in the book until the last 200 pages when they get married, and for a book over 1000 pages, that's not alot. I think people remember the movie more than the actual book.I was really dissapointed with this book. I was looking forward to enjoying a nice read and discovered that it was horrible propaganda. It is really hard to believe that this book won the Pulitzer prize over Absalom,Absalom! by Faulkner.",
            "I really liked this book. I'm a very very fast reader, and I read it in about one and a half hours. I really liked this book. It is a very nice story about the Civil War from a southerners point of view. You don't see very many books like that. I especially liked the part where they have to work in the fields. It shows that the Confederates didn't like the treatment of slaves, but they didn't care about the slaves. I kind of liked this book.",
            "This is not a review or comment on Margaret Mitchell's work, but on the cheap, shoddy way that Scribner decided to package it. My daughter is in her third reading since we purchased this volume as a Christmas present in December, 06, and is the only one reading it in the house. Chunks of pages have begun falling out of the binding. The spine is paper, and not sturdy at that.I'm no expert on bookbinding, but this casts an image (for me, at least) of cheapness over the publisher. I'd like to have thought that for the price, this could have been expected to last a bit longer than 4 months.I guess this one's not going to be an heirloom. I've had many, many paperbacks that are in better condition after similar use.Sad, really, for such a wonderful work, to have been packaged this way.",
            "i absolutely hate this book!!!!!!!!!! i read at a pace of roughly 100 pages in twenty miutes and it took me over six months to finish this book. its hard to get into scarlet is a self cantered brat its unbearably boring and i just flat out want to buy the actual book and burn it!!!!!!!! i am very sorry if this offends anyone... i am sure that margaret michell is a great author but i just cant stand this book...i try my best not to bash any books but i just had to on this one. please forgive me but that is my opinion",

            "The fact that so many people still love this book just shows how racist we still are. It does NOT make it a good book just because you \"like\" it.Don't start with me about Mammy, or about how Scarlett O'Hara doesn't change at ALL throughout the book, except for getting \"tougher.\" Margaret Mitchell did much to immortalize the ridiculous fantasy of \"The South\" that we still cling to today. I'm not saying that there weren't good moments back in Antebellum days, but let's be realistic. In \"Reading Lolita in Tehran,\" the author (I have forgotten her name, may she forgive me) states somewhere that \"even if you're under a benevolent dictator, you're still under a dictator.\"And before I get screams of rage from people who probably also believe in wearing white at their wedding, just remember: just because YOU like it, doesn't mean it's not racist. Just read it with a new eye. That's all I ask. And if you claim that \"ruins\" it, then okay, good. There are plenty of books about plucky heroines that you can read instead, like Jamaica Kincaid's \"Annie John\" and \"Lucy\". Oh, and read \"A Small Place\" while you're at it, to read what Caribbean folks think about our jaunty little cruises down their way.It has to hurt for a while for people to change.",
            "The story is fabulous - as far as I could read. Pages 672 to 705 were missing but 705 to 736 were inserted twice. Apparently a problem on the assembly line! So I'm off to the library to read the missing pages.",
            "This epic tale of Georgia during and after the Civil war is quite possibly one of the best literary works I've ever read. It is powerful and filled with completely three dimensional characters. It follows the struggles of Scarlett O'Hara through the harsh realities that women faced during the war and the determination not to starve and to rebuild her life after the fighting ended. Scarlett is a very strong woman-forthright and levelheaded and stubbornly practical. She is a product of the hardships she had to overcome in order to keep her family and herself alive. No, she isn't a likeable character. But it is her flaws that make her endearing. Melanie is a perfect angel and my favorite character. She seems weak on the surface, but she is the foundation for everyone around her. It is her quiet strength that helps everyone stand on their own two feet. You can't help but love her. This book will live in my mind for a long time. I'm so glad to have read it.",
            "Addressing the complexities between a man and a woman, this great American classic \"Gone with The Wind\", which takes place during the Civil War when the South was badly destroyed and crippled, comes to mind. There is really nothing that this reviewer can think of to match the intensity and dynamics between a temperamentally-suited couple such as Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler. The author, Margaret Mitchell, whose own life story is extremely interesting, leaves us at the end of her magnificent saga to determine in the mind of Scarlett as perhaps those of other readers, whether she is going to be resigned to a life of long regrets, or forge ahead 'Tomorrow' in search of her true love. A brilliant portrayal of war and passion between a man and a woman as Old Dixie goes up in flames. One of the best and enduring American love stories ever, Margaret Mitchell hailing from the South, wrote from her heart and about what she knew at the time while never pretending to be an intellect or an historian. And, to think that a vexed Mitchell would not have agreed to make such a splendid contribution to American literature if a friend of hers had not been overheard saying: 'Peggy is too silly to write a book!'.",

            "I read this book for the first time when I was 14 and I havebeen in love with it ever since. Scarlett was desperate for love, butwas looking in all the wrong places. She loved Rhett, but was too determined to make it in the world without him in an era that frowned on women behaving in that manner. In the end, she only defeated her own purpose; she had plenty of money, but no love. The characters in this book were written with such vivid color that they will live forever, whether in print or on screen.",
            "I read the book before seeing the movie, and the movie makes the book look horrible! I have read GWTW at least ten times and it gets better everytime I read it. I can picture the scences as I read the book. This is the ultimate love story about a woman looking for love and security when it's right in her face. I always cry at the end but I know Scarlett will get Rhett back, she'll just put it out of her mind and think of it tomorrow.",
            "This is the best book ever written. I first read it the summer before eighth grade, and then again around February of that year. There is so much drama. I read the book before seeing the movie, but I don't think it matters what order you do them in, as long as you do both. Everyone should read and watch Gone With the Wind sometime in their life. My favorite character is Scarlett, because she changes and learns so much throughout the book. She learns that she really didn't love Ashley, and she really loved Rhett, although she realized that too late. Scarlett realized how selfish she was to marry two men she didn't love. She married Charles when he was really India's beau, and regretted it when Charles died, like what happened when she stole Frank, her sister's beau. I know I gave this book five stars, but it deserves so much more. Gone With the Wind is a must read for anyone!",
            "I had fought against reading the book for many years. Having seen the movie many times, I thought &quot;Why should I wade through a thousand pages?&quot; Well, something drove me to start the book and I surprised myself by not being able to put it down. I recall actually rushing home from work, barely eating and reading late in the night. The story line is good, and the characters believable. It also provides come insight into a phase of American history, something we all could use. Don't delay - read it soon. I doubt if you'll regret it.",
            "I am 17 and just finish reading Gone with the Wind and thesequal. I loved all the charaters except Ashley. I believe everyemotion that the characters felt and I even know people who are as selfish as Scarlett. The author did a great job in describing everything but I did not enjoy the racism. But one must understand that she grew up in the early 1900s and in the south. She must have heard stories of the war because the rage and anger was still fresh in their minds. It cannot be expected that the book will not be racist when the author grew up with it. It must be overlooked in order to enjoy the great story. In the days that I read it I did not eat, sleep, talk to anybody, or even watch t.v. because it swept me into the world of the American Civil War. The 1000 and plus pages go by in a flash and you wish there were more. I suggest to everybody not to read the sequal because it ruins the characters and is completly unbelieveable and foolish. I loved Rhett, Scarett, and Melly because they have true human emotions. I recommand to watch the movie first so you won't be disappointed. You'll enjoy the handsome Clark Gable, the beautiful Vivien Leigh, and the charming Olivia de Havilland. Great novel!!!",
            "Gone With the Wind, the timeless tale of the old south, depicts colourful characters as they strugggle with the hardships of love, life and the Civil War. Scarlett O'Hara, a tragic hero, matures of her love of Ashley Wilkes, by means of her life experiences, which wisen Scarlett of her downfalls and also her attributes. The fact that the situation thrust upon her wisens her, she is forced to mature herself, and this included her selfish ways. Gone with the Wind is a classic, a must for all who study, or who are remotly interested in the modern history of America.",
            "Well, for starters, I read the book before ever seeing the movie. Margaret Mitchell did a great job on her first novel. I read Scarlett (gets a bit nasty in places, and totally unbelievable), but GWTW is THE book to read. My copy is 1,024 pages long. Don't freak. Amazingly enough, even people who don't like long books ought to like it. Now for the opinions. I hated Ashley, in the book and the movie. I didn't like Melanie very much (&quot;Oh, Melly, don't be a goose.&quot;) 'cause she was so lovable. She was basically perfect. Rhett was a total jerk at times. You probably figured out by now that I side with Scarlett. She was tough, yet tender at times. I think that this book should occupy a place on your shelf or in your hand.",
            "I'm 14. I read this book last winter and still quote words and actually use things the characters learned in this saga to improve my own life. Its almost like self-help but in such an entertaining way. The way the book is written, it is almost as if you are afraid to put the book down because the characters (especially Scarlett, she is quite busy) may do something without you. It is truely the best book I have ever read, and I don't even like historical fiction! i recommend this to anyone who can read. Enjoy!",
            "When I saw this ~1000 page book, I got shocked. Actually my mother recommended me it. I really enjoyed every page. It is not the same as learning about U.S. Civil War in history. Everything was written so perfect that it was extremely hard to put the book down when the work awaited. I have never seen so strong characters as Scarlett and Rett had. I was so sad when the book was over, wanted it to last forever. I really love thick books if they are so great that this one. READ IT !!!",

I am 15 and I read this book around a month ago after a friend of mine told me I just had to read it and I could not put it down. My Mom encouraged me too as she loved it also. Now I know what everyone is raving about. This saga simply swept me off my feet! This isn't just a novel for young girls...it's for everyone and you just have to read it. I was captivated by Mitchell's breathtaking descriptions of the south and how can any female just not fall in love with Rhett? It's almost impossible to describe to you all the aspects of this novel! I went through this book so fast...at times I laughed but there were also times when you ge so annoyed, frusturated and angry at Scarlett's antics (forget about Ashley already!) but you cannot help loving her for who she is too. Though GWTW may not be 100% historically accurate...who really cares!? Also, I just saw the movie...don't miss it!! That was just wonderful as well. (it was also voted the #2 Romance movie of all time by the Amerian Film Institute recently!) As for the sequel, Scarlett, I was a little dissapointed but I had to have closure and have the comfort of knowing Rhett took Scarlett back. All in all, read Gone With the Wind! This monumental epic has all the aspects of a book anyone could ever look for.",

            "Gone With The Wind is one of the most powerful works of literature I've ever read- its fluildy eloquent style and intricatly crafted descriptions make it seem more like a scene being played out, rather than words on page. I couldn't put it down- there are so many twists, and nothing turns out the way you hope it would. This is the best book I've ever read, and I recommend it to everyone.",
            "Gone With the Wind is a great book that gives lots of descriptive detail, it as if you are there in the story. The book puts the movie to shame. I read the book before seeing the movie and I am glad I did. With as much detail that is in the book it is hard to make any kind of movie from it. The book story line is set during the Civil War. Placing the story during the Civil War makes the action and adventure seeker want to read the book. Although the book takes about war a lot there are several love triangles in the book. Having these love triangles in the story keeps the tension in the story and makes the read wonder who will be with who next. Having the story take place during this time brings a sense of realism to the book and makes the reader feel for the characters during this time. The book is also set in the point of view of the south. Having the book take place in the south is different and makes the reader realize why the war was being fought. This is a very fun book to read and I would recommend it anyone.",
            "Gone With The Wind is the best book I have ever read. I like it because of the setting{I like the old time books}and the characters. I also like it because it is very long and keeps my interest, which is very hard to do. So I think it is a good book to read.",

Margaret Mitchell has skillfully woven life's everyday struggles in with the struggles only faced during Reconstruction. Although I do not beleive in Scarlett's thoughts about the war and Yankees and so on, it was almost hard not to empathyize with her and her struggles. Although all in all a nasty person, sometimes you can't help but love her.The strength of character portrayed by Melanie Wilkes has decided for me what I will name my first little girl. Melanie.As for Rhett, I do believe he is my favorite of them all.",
            "This book was an amazing view of the Civil War era as well as a beautiful love story. It is a testament to the strain the war caused on every person in the country at the time. Aside from the war it let's you in to the parts of your soul that too many try to hide. Some people think Scarlett was a demon, but I think she was and is a part of every person. Everyone should read GWTW. If you don't your really missing out. It is by far the best I've ever read and I'm convinced I'll never find better.",
            "This book is magical. It is enthralling and hard to peel your eyes away from. It is a delight to read and when you pull yourself away your mind is still in the old South. I found myself often dazed when I wasn't reading it. It is time consuming. Though this book is fantastic I both loved and hated the ending. It just didn't feel right. Like it wasn't finished and it desperatley needed a sequal. It would have been wonderful if Margaret Mitchell had written the sequal but she didn't so A. Ripley gave it her best shot. Although she is critizised for it I thought is was good as I don't believe GWTW is finished without the most famous characters of all time; Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler, together and in love.",

She struggles through the hardships of the Civil War, supporting herself and her family. Her story is one of the strongest I have ever read. I recommend this book to everyone-it has just the right amount of romance, sadness, and truth in it to make it one of the greatest books.",
            "Gone With the Wind will totally blow you away, it surely blew me away. This book is a classic love story. It totally draws you in with the push-pull relationship between the main characters, Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara. It makes you want to scream at Scarlett because she just pushes Rhett away unknowingly, and Rhett is trying to pull her into love with money and luxurious clothes. This book is a good book because the events could happen in our time, marry for money and make your selves misreable, but who knows how it could end. If you enjoy books that make you throw them down in frustration, but pick them back up again just to find out what happens next, this book is definitely good for you. If you enjoy this book or were unhappy with the ending, breeze through Scarlett, the sequel to Gone with the Wind. Gone With the Wind is an outstanding book and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys suspense and love all mixed together in a great book.",
            "i think this book is wonderful!i've always liked Gone with the Wind,but when my mom bought it for me,i looked at it and it was so huge,that it took me a long time to finally start reading it.but when i did,not even a bomb could of stopped me from putting it down.i read it every time a got a chance to(between commercials,before school,after school,from 6 to midnight)i even stopped doing everything else i used to do just so i could read it.it is so well written,that you know the characters in and out,even though you never met them.i knew what the characters were like,but just like in real life,there was just so much to know about them,that it's impossible to describe a character.this is the first book and movie that has ever made me cry.when,finally,at the end of the book,scarlett realized that she loves rhett, and not ashley,it's too late and the sad ending(at that time) seemed worse than anything i've ever had to think about.at first,i was mad at three people:rhett,scarlett,and ashley(if you can believe it).rhett-because he didn't tell scarlett that he loved her after they were married(at least not enought for scarlett)and scarlett is too childish to realize that all those things that he for her and her children is because he loves her.scarlett-because her stupid pride stopped her from telling him that she loves him in time and for not telling him that she was sorry for anything that she did or said.and ashley-for realizing and telling scarlett that he doesn't love her way too late.but,in spite of all this,i love this book and i will recommend this to anyone in a heartbeat.",
            "Margaret Mitchell's evergreen saga of the Civil War era has become a kind of cultural icon. This sprawling novel was her sole work, but what a book! Two of the leading protagonists, Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler, are perhaps the best known fictional characters in American literature. The saintly Melanie Wilkes and her reticent husband Ashley are also widely recognized.Northern writers have yet to produce a comparable work. Mitchell's novel plugs into the antebellum nostalgia of the south. Even though her writing arguably does not meet the high standards of gifted southern writers (such as Flannery O'Connor and company), her wonderful narrative skills continue to make this book an enduring best-seller, decade after decade.As generations of American booklovers will testify, &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is a highly rewarding, romantic must-read.",
            "Hello! I read this book because I felt like I had to( It's a classic) and I did think it would be extremely sentimental, soap opera- like and, in Germany where I live we say KITSCHIG. But after a few pages I realised that it was exciting, and I didn't put it down all day. The one thing I disliked was the Ku- Klux- Clan scenes. They all apreciated this terrible, violent clan. This made me angry.Scarlett is a great charakter. She's not sympathatic, but when finally her beloved ones die and turn away from her, you feel sorry for her. A must-have-read!!!!",
            "Gone with the Wind is the most amazing novel ever! I read it in 8th grade for a school project and was so engrossed all 1,024 pages took me just two weeks! Living in the \"North\", I had never really thought about how hard it was for the \"South\" because I assumed they brought it on themselves. This book really opened my eyes and I'm glad it did. I love it so much that this year ... I read it again, just for fun, during the school year and it only took me two weeks again!! I highly recomend this novel to anyone and everyone in the world!",
            "I am not sure how anyone can read the book and not see the love story. It may come near the end, but yes it is there. Gone With the Wind is one of the best books ever written. It incorporates action, romance, drama... I often find myself using silly facts that you learn from the book. Gone With the Wind gives the modern public a look at what life was like for a Southern plantation owner during the Civil War, and no book will ever challenge the status Gone with the Wind has achieved.",
            "This book had everything I like to read about in it. From the vivacious Scarlett, to the loyal Melanie, to the blatant Rhett, the soft Ashley, and all the others, this book has it all. It includes comedy, tragedy, history, emotion, and many other things. My favorite character was Melanie. Scarlett drove me nuts. You get so pulled into the book that I actually stopped reading for a while because Scarlett was eing so mean to Melanie!! Definately a must read in the life of a true gentleperson.",
            "&quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is one of those impossible-to-put-down sagas that everyone should read. It is a perfect read in the summer-nearly 1000 pages to keep you reading throughout those long, lazy days. &quot;Scarlett O'Hara was not beautiful, but men seldom realized it&quot;...from the first lines of the book we are enchanted. And the passionate, emotional story of Scarlett O'Hara is the story of a how a war changed Scarlett's life, the story of how a pampered Southern belle became a woman changed by terrible circumstances. It is a love story, a story of one person, and story of Civil War-era South.There are a couple of key things that make this book the classic that it is. First, Margaret Mitchell really is one of those &quot;born&quot; storytellers. She is wonderful with description, and makes us &quot;feel&quot; things, yet seems to know exactly how much description is too much or too little. She effortlessly creates a seamless story taking place over many years, with never a dull moment on any one of the 954 pages. That alone is enough to make a novel &quot;stand out&quot;.&quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is also filled with vibrant characters. Margaret Mitchell's effective descriptions and keen insights into the minds of each character make this book even better. There is Scarlett, whose stubborn streak, determined mind, and desperate love we see and identify with; there is Melanie, sweet, trusting, and fiercely loyal (she happens to be my favorite character); there is Rhett, the puzzling, reckless, and mysterious blockader who is much like Scarlett; and there is Ashley, the one love that Scarlett cannot have.The only thing about this book that ISN'T absolutely perfect is the racism. Like many Southerners at that time, Margaret Mitchell had a very biased opinion of black people and their place in society. It was disturbing to read descriptions such as &quot;their monkey-like faces&quot; and &quot;darkies need to be treated like children&quot; in this book. However, I think this was in the book because that was how it WAS in the South then, not necessarily because the author thought it SHOULD BE that way. Racism is certainly wrong, but that was a part of the Southern way of life before, during, and after the Civil War.&quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is a wonderfully captivating book filled with characters that we can all identify with. Read it and you'll certainly see why this book, first published in 1936, is still popular today.",
            "Hey Everyone! I absolutely LOVE this book. Everybody thought that I was crazy because I am 11 years old and I read a book with over 1,000 pages. But the book turned out to be wonderful! I would recommend it to everybody. The tale of Scarlett O'Hara stole my heart. Margaret Mitchell is a wonderful author and a great story teller. Everybody has to read this stupendous novel at least one time in their life!",
            "I never thought a book good be so beautiful, so wonderful, good enough to eat. I saw the movie in 3rd grade and fell in love with it. I decided to go to my school library and pick up a copy of the book. I started reading and even the librarian couldnt believe that such a young child, with such an adult book.My teacher, and class mates, IMPRESSED! For me, I never wanted to stop. From Twelve Oaks to Tara, the thrill never ends. So I finished it with partly understanding but then re-read it in sixth grade. The words that were chosen to make this book, is truly amazing. I have to hand it to your Margaret Mitchell, for creating the best book that America will ever know. Because with all of the books I have read and with all of the books I am going to read, I know there is nothing like, \"Gone with The Wind.\" \"Frankly My dear...there is nothing like it!\" So I am suggesting you start reading it soon, because if you dont have time to day, dont worry . . . \"Because tomorrow is another day,\"",
            "Ever read a good book? My favorite book is Gone With the Wind. The Main characters are Scarlett O'Hara, Ashley Wilkes (BOY), and Melanie Hamilton. Since Scarlett is mensioned more often, we'll call her the mainest character. Scarlett is selfish, arrogant, hypocrative, and just down right mean!In this story, Scarlett is in love with Ashley. Ashley is to marry his cousin, Melly,( Sick right?), even though he loves Scarlett. Though Scarlett tries to make him jealous by marrying other men, Ashley stays loyal to his frail wife. Then, Scarlett, after 2 marriges that ended in the husband's death, comes upon a broad-backed, strong, handsome, rich, Charlestonian man. In the end, Scarlett ends up with her 3rd husband, leaving her with 2 children from previous marriges, one dead child, no friends, a large house, and oodles of money! Isn't this what she's wanted?Although this story is from evil Scarlett's point of view, it's still a wonderful story full of action, romance, sad and happy times, and hilarious scenes that don't quite seem to fit. Scarlett does the most hilarious things to get Ashley to notice her and he does many in return. I think that this book should be for 8th grade and up. If you're a boy you have to LOVE romance to like this and ladies don't need to be any personality or like any types of books, because there's things for all appeal.CAUTION: This book may lead to much dictionary research and much more study of the Civil War!",
            "This is a story about the life of a spoiled, selfish woman, Scarlett, going through the civil war period. It gives you an understanding of south's point of view. Several reviewers complained that it is racist. I would agree with those people but I don't like reading books that I agree with all the time. I found it valuable to try to understand what motivated the south to fight to preserve slavery. It seemed Mitchell was almost trying to defend slavery; if this offends and upsets you, then perhaps this may not be an enjoyable book for you.The character development is outstanding in this book. I constantly found myself comparing the book's characters with people I know. I've read many Michener books, which are also long historical fictions. I enjoy his books a lot, but this was far better than any of his books due primarily to her excellent character development.This book will stay with me forever.",
            "This will always be my all-time favourite book. The most sumptuous and vivd imagery. Such intriguing and authentic characters. And of course Scarlett is one of the most fascinating women in literary history precisely because she is so ahead of her time and dared to be different. I just love her though I certainly don't like her much!As much as I adore the movie as well, particularly the exquisite Vivien Leigh, it doesn't capture even half the richness of the novel.This is one book I re-read every few years and continue to find new elements to fascinate every time.",
            "I was out of non-fiction and had to settle for a novel, so why not the most famous of all? A smart move! I've read many historical accounts of the Civil War from many perspectives: The North, the South, the general, the private, the battle, the location, the time period,, and there is even one from the point of view of a horse! This is Scarlett O'Hara's view from her plantation, Tara, outside of Atlanta. What a refreshing perspective! The story is grand and Mitchell's graphic style keeps the images flashing onto every page. Yes, Scarlett is a bitch, but that just makes her all the more desirable. Yes, this is a \"girl's book,\" as was often pointed out to me, but guys can show their feminine side while reading of General Sherman laying waste to Georgia! A tip: See the movie first, it's a good introduction to the book. I read the book first and then saw the movie. The movie was so condensed that it almost seemed to run on fast-forward.",
            "I've seen the movie so many times I can recite it. But the book is so much better!! For lovers of the movie, you have to suck it up and take on 1024 pages of passion, despair, and the most amazing love story ever.I love Scarlett and yet at the same time I want to wring her neck. I wish I had Rhett Butler - I'd treat him right!! At the end of the book, just like the end of the movie, I ended up with tears running hopelessly down my cheeks.In addition to the adventures of a spirited young woman from Georgia, Scarlett also reveals much truth about the devastation witnessed in Georgia throughout the war and during the terrible years of Reconstruction.It's a gem to be treasured, and read over again.",
            "Margaret Mitchell presents characters whose depth is astonishing, and depictions of varied relationships that can reach the reader on numerous levels. This is not merely a love story or glorified version of a tragic historical period, but an intense treatment of much of the paradox in human nature.Regarding the racial issue - I would say that the depiction of blatant racism in this book is all the more powerful because everything is told from the Southern aristocrat's point of view. The characters need to believe, and have convinced themselves, that they are benevolent and affectionate towards their slaves! Yet they refer to these same people as &quot;apes&quot; without seeing their own horrifying stance. When Melanie, supposedly the soul of kindness, tells Ashley that, if they move North, they cannot let Beau attend school and &quot;have pickaninnies in his class,&quot; it shows the horror of racism just as clearly as if the reader had seen the miserable lot of the slaves.Scarlett, certainly no heroine and one with no principles who'd like merely the reputation for being a &quot;great lady,&quot; is a most intriguing character. As Margaret Mitchell makes clear in many references, we have here one who is incapable of being at all analytical. (Except for Rhett, and, to some extent, Gerald, only Mammy can see through Scarlett's facade.) The Ashley she loves is a creation of her imagination - and it is interesting that, for all that she despises Melanie, the traits Melanie has which Scarlett most derides are very much the same as those in the Ellen that she idolises.The book has so many fascinating characters that one could read it ten times and still find one has only scratched the surface. Those like myself, who cannot imagine too many settings they'd like to enter less than the &quot;old South,&quot; can find it interesting to explore the situation of those who find their entire world has collapsed around them.",
            "Gone With The Wind is the best book ever written short of the Bible.I have heard people say it's rascist- my opinion is why sugarcoat everything that happened in the Civil War? I think there was rascism at the time the book takes place. The book was written with exhaustive historical truth- if you make it sound like blacks ran around in tuxedos, then you undermine their suffering. And make the book unreal.People did suffer, but not all slaves suffered.If you're looking for a superbly written romance, if you are smart enough to see through people, you will love GWTW. IF you can't, you won't be able to see how Scarlett, shrewd, hard, proud, stubbern, is also smart, learns how to yield, proud as a virtue, and persistant. She complains and dreams the whole time she saves Tara but through sheer grit she does it and saves the people on it.You maybe cannot see how Rhett Butler loves this unseeing woman with complete passion, devotion- 'as much as a man can love a woman'. How the dishonest blockade runner goes crazy when his adored little girl dies. How he is a real daddy to Scarlett's other fatherless children.Read this book--- it is all about people. Anytime we can see ourselves in something, with a small sense of guilt we indenify and fall in love with it.GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!!!",
            "I loved this book! The most amazing thing about GONE WITH THE WIND (and there are many) are the beautiful characters that Mitchell creates. I felt pain, and laughter right along with Scarlett. All the characters seemed so real to me, and I grew to love them so. Mitchell is so brave to have not made a person like Melanie as the main character, a person that everyone would love. Instead she forces the reader to fall in love with a selfish, stubborn, mean, hateful person like Scarlett. Scarlett is definetly my favorite literary figure, she is by no means a perfect person, but you see parts of yourself in her, parts that you may not want to see, and that makes her all the more real. True to form, the most interesting characters in the book are the people with more sinister sides to themselves. To compliment Scarlett, there is of course, Rhett Butler. Every episode he was in came to life, just by the addition of his witty back handed comments, and his insightfullness to realize just how unscrupulous he and others are. Every diolouge is a joy, be it anyone from Prissy, to Rhett speaking, the words fly fromt the page, and never get boring. The turns that the book takes never fail to surprise. Once I got into this book, I couldn't put it down. The most important thing to remember while reading it though, is to take the book as it is. In parts, tales of the blacks lording over the whites, and the views of slaves, are hard to swallow, and painful to read. And they are not entirely accurate. But this was written by a southerner, in a different time, about an EXTREMELY different time, so all of these things must be taken in stride, and read with caution. Over all, this is a book that which will tear at your heart, make you cry with laughter, and, even make you fall in love with an ignorant, racist, Southern Belle.",
            "First I fell in love with the movie,then I read the book.The edition I have was my moms from the 1930's so i think its an original copy.This story is more than a love story. It is a study in human nature from Scarlets temper tantrums to Rhetts deep devoted love of Scarlet so much so that he has to leave her for his own good.This is undoubtly the best book ever written and by a newcomer at that. Margaret Mitchell outdid herself on this one.",
            "I was twelve years old when I first read this book and fell in love with Scarlett, Rhett, and the Old South. Now, 20 years later, I work in a bookstore and I still recommend this book to customers all the time. When people tell me that they have seen the movie, and therefore don't feel they need to read the book, I always strongly disagree with them. The book is so much better than the movie, and I'm sure I'll be recommending it to people for many years to come.",
            "Reading Gone With The Wind is indeed an experience. It is able to change the opinion on romance stories for someone who does not like to read romance, it made me unable to put down the book even though I was busy.The story basically tells how the beautiful Southern belle Scarlett O Hara hardened during the American Civil War and her ruthless ways of making money even it means to marry someone whom she did not love as well as engaging the convicts to run the mills. The story also talks about the unusual love between Scarlett and Rhett Butler whom Scarlett hated intially and also the patriotism of the American Southerners. One could feel the different emotions of Human when reading the story such as jealousy, anger, honour between people and the country, love and so on. It is one unforgettable reading experience and Margaret Mitchell is indeed a talented writer whom I should say that it was regrettable that she was not the one who was writing the sequel to this story. Gone With The Wind is a highly recommended story.",
            "The movie is one the top classic cinimatographies that remains a hit to this day. The book however is far better. I was so spellbound by this novel that it put the movie to shame (although I am still in love with the movie).The words of Margaret Mitchell combined with the voice naration of Linda Stephens sets an imaginative scene unlike any other. I will admit there were a couple areas in this audio book that somewhat dragged a little and there were other parts where Linda Stephens' voice dramatized a little too far.Margaret Mithchell wrote a breathtaking novel of true passion combined with the overwhelming heartache and the meaning of love in it's finest. And Linda Stephens brings out the roll of each charactor, each with a pitch of their own.Chapter by chapter leads out the fall of selfishness, the depth of passion and the power one has in the will to correct. Gone With the Wind portrays how one [Scarlett O'Hara], like so many can blind themselves in seeking to gain wealth of money and false imagination - where as it can fool (time and time again) to throw away the richest love one could ever gain.",
            "\".....Was Tara still standing? Or was Tara also gone with the wind which had swept through Georgia?.....\" pg 365\".... Thoughts circled and swooped above her, dived down and drove tearing claws and sharp beaks into her mind, For a timeless time, she lay still, her face in the dirt, the sun beating hotly upon her...\" pg 356This is a literary masterpiece that really needs no introduction; and the only reason I comment tonight is for benefit of younger people who may not have read it as yet, and are making comparisons with the more recent \"Scarlett\" and, even more recently, \"Rhett Butler's People\". Neither of the sequel books, written by others, are representatives of the talent embodied by Margaret Mitchell herself.This story is one of the best ever told, and will go down through the ages as such. An unmatched tale of the Old South, where worlds are turned upside down and those exposed to sudden loss of wealth and life stations find unsuspected strengths within themselves as they rebuild their fortunes with nothing more than their tenacity and wits or find themselves \"winnowed out\" (as Rhett Butler so eloquently remarked) in the struggle. Unrequited love, passion, jealousy, mingle seamlessly with the historical passages written with digital accuracy regarding the Civil War and the resulting Reconstruction, misery for both black and white - is woven into the fabric of the story with attention to detail that, once read, lives within you forever. It's cast of characters live, breathe, and project their differences from the brilliance of Mitchell's pen into our own minds; truly unforgettable. THAT is the true measure of literary genius.If you are in search of the story, read this one and forget the other two, as there is no equal to the original GWTW, nor is there ever likely to be.",
            "GONE WITH THE WIND was a phenomenon when it first appeared as a novel during the 30's and its place in popular culture became even more entrenched when the wildly successful movie was released a few years later. The book is still worth reading today as Mitchell very skillfully brings to life the years just before during and after the Civil War from the viewpoint of white Georgians. When Mitchell started writing this book the Civil War had only been over less than seventy years (very comparable to a contemporary author writing about the events surrounding World War II) and the country was very deeply divided between North and South. Mitchell's Southern sympathies and prejudices are often very apparent and the modern reader needs to realize the author was a product of her time and not be so easily offended that they can not enjoy what the book has to offer. Mitchell created many memorable characters in her novel and though it has been called a \"soap opera\" the situations and characterizations are not unrealistic and the historical research is sound.",
            "It is a long book and oft discussed with over six hundred reviews, thus this is not an attempt to give a general, overall review. But there is a point I'd like to discuss:I was amused at several of the comments written by other reviewers regarding the point of view in Gone With the Wind. It is easy to only watch the movie and quickly read the book and leave with the wrong impression of what Mitchell wanted to portray about Southern culture and Southern values.But if the reader takes his or her time and carefully reads the passages, a very different picture of the antebellum south comes about. Pay particular attention to the dialogues between Scarlett and her mammy, and Scarlett and Rhett, and even Ashley. Scarlett routinely complains at having to act like a simpleton in order to win men's attention, and having to conceal her often much brighter \"smartness\" (I hesitate to use the word intelligence here, because, Scarlett, for all her skills and quick smartness, probably doesn't qualify as an intelligent person) in fear of scaring away potential suitors.The antebellum upper class woman, as portrayed by Mitchell, was a dainty flower, but one whose life was heavily circumscribed by the social expectations of the men. Mitchell points out the juxtaposition between plantation mistresses being expected to appear to the public as dainty china objects, yet behind the scenes be expected to manage large plantations, oversee dozens or hundreds of slaves, and deal with the everyday facts of nature (such as childbirth and sickness). Ellen O'Hara is portrayed as the archetypical plantation mistress who successfully pulls off this image: while her husband spends his day hunting and riding horses and drinking whisky, Ellen had a dawn to midnight existence as a tireless manager of a plantation, and \"her hands were never seen still.\"To some people it seems that Mitchell idolized certain aspects of antebellum southern culture-the theatre of manners that the southern upper class created for themselves, but the author was well aware and effectively portrayed to the reader how limiting it was to women. In fact, it was only with the destruction of the plantation world and the class of chivalry that Scarlett, her main character, was effectively liberalized. It is very much a feminist novel in the sense that it is the woman who succeeds (at least materialistically) when most men around her failed.The issue of slavery is a relatively minor one in the book, and not one that Mitchell discussed to great lengths. However, one must keep in mind that the book portrays the views of the upper class aristocracy class, and it is interesting to note that despite the supposed benevolence of the O'Haras and their neighbors, of the 100+ slaves at Tara before the war, only four remained to stay with their old masters. Mitchell did not get into great details on the brutality of slavery before the war or of white-black relationships, but she didn't completely ignore it either. During a scene when Scarlett visits several neighbors (all women) on a nearby plantation after Sherman and his army had passed through, one of the women mentioned how all the black women had gone off riding behind the Yankee soldiers, and that they'll get nothing but yellow babies out of it. The other ladies, shocked at the bringing up of a delicate topic, hushed her, but old Grandma Fontaine retorted back with, \"We've all seen yellow babies before and we know what it means.\"There is, of course, Rhett Butler's consistent disparaging of Southern culture and southern values.Mitchell did not idealize the antebellum south, far from it.",
            "Many people only know Gone With The Wind through the beautiful 1939 David O. Selznick film. That is a disappointment, as the novel is so much richer and complex than the film could realize.Written in the mid 1930s by a novice writer, it nonethe less manages to evoke the spirit of the Civil War and the passion that is Scarlett O'Hara.While commonly viewed as a war novel, it is actually much more: both a brilliant comedy of manners and the first frankly feminist novel written. Ms. Mitchell manages to make us care about Scarlett, while allowing us also to laugh at her occasionally.Do not be put off by the book's length. While an enormous undertaking, it moves along at a breakneck pace, and is absorbing from the very first page.Some have criticized the book for its racist portrayal of the black characters. While it does seem so from a 21st Century perspective, that can perhaps be forgiven when remembering that it was written by a Southerner in the early 20th Century. In any event, some of the most noble, sympathetic characters of the book are black and slaves.This is a book to enjoy and savor more than once. The 60th Anniversary Edition is especially nice, coming in a slipcover and containing analysis of the book by other authors and literary critics.",
            "Gone With the Wind is novel of epic proportions, and it does read like a soap opera. Then again, so does every book this long (try War and Peace sometime). This book examines a spoiled, ante-bellum socialite who has never had to lift a finger and the way she deals with utter poverty, death, and tragedy all around her. The book does have its flaws, which I will touch on in a moment, but it should be read simply for Scarlett's struggle. Yes, she is rude, mean, and a generally selfish and scheming woman, but she also a paragon of strength who simply refuses to bow to anyone. Throughout the book, people say that Sherman himself should beware of Scarlett, and they're right.Getting away from Scarlett--difficult in this novel--there are several other main characters. Rhett-the only man she cannot lure with her charms, Ashley-the only man she cannot get with her charms, and Melanie-Ashley's saintly wife--the antithesis of Scarlett, whom Scarlett hates but feels compelled to help.Much of this book is somewhat depressing, reading about hunger, toiling in the fields, working on the sick, but it does make you appreciate what you have.Now, for the flaws. First, the big one: Racism. Yes, this book is racist, but, for heaven's sake, it was written in 1936 by a woman from Atlanta who had been raised with her antebellum grandmothers. It's set in the Civil War, and it does accurately portray the feelings of whites at the time. Some of the black sentiments (&quot;Gee, Miss Scarlett, I wouldn't know what to do without you telling me&quot;) are a little incredulous, but there were some plantation owners who were nice to their slaves. Of course, the ones who get publicity were the evil ones. While evil slave owners did exist, this book is not about them, and it should be taken at face value. No, it isn't politically correct, but it wasn't meant to be. If you only want politically correct books, then you really can't even read the Bible.Other flaws: the subjecation of women to men (think of the time era again), the length (some descriptive parts can be skipped), and the many plots (watch the movie as you go to keep it all together).Other than these few things mentioned, this book is a marvelous example of Southern literature, but don't take it as a historical novel of the Civil War because it wasn't meant to be that. It's the story of one woman's refusal to surrender to whatever comes her way. It just happens to take place during the Civil War. It could have happened during the American Revolution; it just didn't. Also, it leaves you with a serious debate with yourself: Scarlett--justified or evil? Yes, she gets her riches and life back while everyone else mopes, but they eventually get their lives back as well--they just didn't demean themselves. Rare is the book that makes you question your own thoughts on the main character.",
            "ARGUABLY one of the greatest romance novels ever written, Margaret Mitchell's Gone With The Wind is also a quintessential war anecdote.I found nothing more powerful than to read of an American war set in 1864 and hear the television espousing our current warfare in the background - some things don't change.The vivacious, yet practical-minded, Scarlett O'Hara is a clean slate for Mitchell to mar with the outset of war, providing a powerful metaphor for generations to come.Unfortunately, many young people are not introduced to such classic literature and the distinct and poignant parallels between the American Civil War and the current Gulf War II may be left undiscovered.Considering her novel was written in 1936, it is easy to confuse her ability to evoke such universal emotions for modernity.Mitchell's delicate portrayal of the South set against the harsh backdrop of war can still be affiliated to by readers in the 21st Century.Reasoning war, censoring protestors or 'speculators', and anticipated outcomes are adeptly constructed by Mitchell that you wonder how predictable human nature must be.\"All wars are sacred... To those who have to fight them. If the people who started wars didn't make them sacred, who would be foolish enough to fight?\"It's such honesty, in a time of ettiquette and refinery, that makes the abhorrent Rhett Butler such a formidable character.Coercing the seductress to dispense of typically Southern notions, Rhett epitomises the way a war will corrupt and educate a sentimental nation.Mitchell presents her flawed characters with affection. You may find Scarlett simple and Rhett a rogue, but you come to love what they add to this charged scene.Gone With The Wind should hardly be dismissed because of its romantic formula and age. This book is timeless and has much to teach younger readers.",
            "I read this book two years ago during the summer I was fourteen. It was definitely one of the best books I ever read, and I don't think I would be me today without the influence of Gone With the Wind. Margaret Mitchell is a witch with a pen; her thrilling story of Scarlett, Rhett, Melanie, Ashley, and Tara is as compelling as it is frightening. You love every character and hate them at the same time while next to them you feel their pain, their longing, their heartache, their confusion, their human wickedness, and their love.Two warnings: I made the mistake of reading the ending of the book before I got to it. I didn't understand the ending but thought I did, so it ruined not only the completion but also my enjoyment of a matchless masterpiece. Do not, under any circumstances, read the ending. Secondly, if you have not seen the movie, don't watch it. If you have, don't be fooled. I read the book long before I saw the movie and felt like a part of GWTW. The movie is supposed to be one of the best ever made, but I was disappointed with it. The characters seemed compromised somehow, and the glory of my imagination was warped.GWTW is a daunting book, but I have not met a person on earth who does not call it a mountain above most. Read the book and love it!",
            "Thirty-two summers ago, I read my Great Aunt Cora's old copy of GWTW. The size was not daunting, even at twelve years old. I lived in Margaret Mitchell's Old South for weeks, shunning the sun as all Southern ladies should. Excitingly, I told my mother that Scarlett just kissed Rhett on the road to Rough and Ready, so they were bound to live happily ever after. I remember her secretive smile like it was yesterday. I still have that old book, and have probably read it more often than Aunt Cora. No other book has ever captivated me to the point that modern customs and places are foreign, while I am at Tara, Twelve Oaks, Aunt PittyPats', and even Belle's! The best of all times for me.",
            "I'm a literary snob, I'll admit it. I've read all the classics, and I even know some Literary Theory. Gone With the Wind? Pul-lease, racist, sexist, revanchist trash, made popular by all the young woman dreaming of being Scarlett and having both their Rhett and Ashley. Cheerleader fare. Escapist. WRONG!Gone with the Wind is an American War &amp; Peace. This is serious literature, which won the Pulitzer prize, no less. Most people don't see past the epic plot (which isn't as cut and dried as you may think) or the love story, but this is no less than a successfull attempt to reclaim a discarded culture. It is not about crinoline and lace, it it about the Apocalypse and how losers of the counter-revolution must learn to live in a place where all their politics, personal or civil, are demolished. Scarlett O'Hara is popular because she is an American, driven, materialistic, sentimental and utterly ruthless. Rhett Bulter is the tragic character of this book; the way of life and ideals he disdained are killing him, and he suffers like no one else in this post-apocalyptic landscape. His departure at the end is an act of contrition as much as a romantic failure; he had tried to recreate the materialism of the ante-bellum world, but negeclected the spirituality (such as it is) of men like Ashley Wilkes. Both men, the dreamer and the realist end up alone in a very sterile place. This book is proto-feminist as well. Scarlett survives, even as everything around her dies, but in the end, she too is alone.Don't dumb this masterpiece down. The movie fails to capture even a tenth of the depth here. And that awful sequel! Caused by the mistake that this book is some kind of romance novel. This is Art, and you can't stick a new ending on it, any more than you can a great painting or musical composition.",
            "I've read GWTW many times -once you get going you can't stop! I once gave a copy to a friend to read -she said it was 'too old fashioned' oh well her loss. I'm glad I'm in the company of true 'Windies' so I thought I'd share with you some interesting facts about the book: -Scarlett was originally named Pansy-Scarlett was partly based on Mitchell herself and her grandmother-Rhett was based on Mitchell's first husband Red Upshaw-the initials JRM in her dedication refer to her second husband John Reginald Marsh-Margaret Mitchell maintained the only character taken from real life was Prissy the maid-When asked who she'd like to be in the movie version, Mitchell said 'Prissy'-Like a detective novelist, Mitchell wrote the last chapter first and the first chapter last-GWTW is the only book to sell more copies than the bible-Mitchell nearly went blind just proofreading the manuscript!-Mitchell scrupously researched every detail for GWTW, even going to the town register to ensure there was no Rhett Butler or Scarlett O'Hara alive during the Civil War-The novel took ten years to complete, most of it was written in three-For style, she endeavoured to make her prose so that a five-year old could read it-If she were ever to write a sequel, it would be called 'Back With the Breeze' On that note,please avoid the Ripley penned sequel 'Scarlett', it is atrocious.-Gone with the Wind is my favourite book of all time, and yours too, I hope. Enjoy!",
            "I would give this 10 stars if I could. I haven't read this since I was a young girl in the early 70's and should never have waited so long to read it again. The characters were exceptionally well drawn, the dialogue was brilliant, particularly between Rhett (SIGH!) and Scarlett. I swear there was sparks flying off the pages. I am going to miss the people I will have to put behind me now that the book has come to an end, Rhett (SIGH), Scarlett, Mammy, Prissy and Aunt Pitty Pat (LOL).The author's use of prose was beautiful, all the scenes and action came alive for me. Some people seem to be offended by the racism in the book, but that's how things were back then. Sugar coating it would have ruined the story reducing it to a Harlequin romance.This is an incredibly well written book about the death of a civilization and the struggles to survive in the new era. This is a book that should not be missed, particulary those who enjoy historical fiction.",
            "It took this reviewer half a century to get around to reading this great novel for the first time! Appreciating it then, with 'fresh eyes' I share the view that \"Gone With The Wind\" is quite simply the most readable long novel of all time. With world-wide sales nudging 25 million, it's probably fair to say that most first-time readers (apart from the odd reviewer here at the world's biggest web site) have shared that opinion in the almost 70 years since Margaret Mitchell wrote her one-and-only book. At least one other, highly readable novelist of the past century, the late James A. Michener certainly felt that way.I'm recalling an interview of thirty years ago in which Michener - a master storyteller in his own right - expressed awe at Mitchell's achievement. I remember Michener quoted a long-forgotten critic who greeted the book's release in 1936 with the perfect, one-sentence summing up: \"It's the shortest long novel I have ever read!\" Michener predicted at that time (1975) that \"critics will forever have to grapple with the problem of why Margaret Mitchell's novel has remained so readable, and so important to so many people.\"Michener singled out a few of the \"super-dramatic confrontations\" so perfectly conjured up in Mitchell's lucid, timeless writing style: Mammy lacing Scarlett into her corset; the wounded at the railway station; Scarlett shooting the Union straggler; the girls making Scarlett a dress from the moss-green velvet draperies; Rhett carrying his wife upstairs to the long-unused bedroom.Yet for all of its amazing drama, the novel does not ultimately depend upon major confrontations for its page-turning momentum: Michener I remember, zeroed in on two 'central' paragraphs which provide the reader with perfect glimpses into the way the two major characters have 'grown' before our eyes within these pages. One of these paragraphs captivates our imagination in about the middle of the book (chapter 29):\"Somewhere, on the long road that wound through those four years, the girl with her sachet and dancing slippers, had slipped away, and there was left a woman with sharp green eyes, who counted pennies and turned her hands to many menial tasks, a woman to whom nothing was left from the wreckage, except the indestructible red earth on which she stood.\"And, in the final pages, that indelible portrait of Rhett, age forty-five:\"He was sunken in his chair, his suit wrinkling untidily against his thickening waist, every line of him proclaiming the ruin of a fine body and the coarsening of a strong face. Drink and dissipation had done their work on the coin-clean profile, and now it was no longer the head of a young pagan prince on newly minted gold, but a decadent, tired Caesar on copper debased by long usage.\"It's true to say (again as Michener noted thirty years ago) that the weakness of \"Gone With The Wind\" is the almost exclusive focus on Atlanta, ignoring the rest of the South: When in fact, it was really the ENTIRE South that changed, \"altered by war, and defeat, and social upheaval - and stark determination to re-establish itself.\" Michener astutely observed that GWTW \"depicts with remarkable felicity, the spiritual history of a region.\"Most everyone these days would concede that Margaret Mitchell's personal views on the \"liberation of the former slaves\" (as expressed in subsequent interviews) were less than compassionate. Nevertheless, it was NOT Mitchell who composed those words which make some of us wince when they're scrolling up the screen in the movie version - words quaintly poetic perhaps, but manifestly insulting to those Americans whose ancestors never mistook the days of slavery as part of some \"pretty world\" poignantly longed-for, or in some way better than America today. (This reviewer has a pretty good memory for well-cadenced English prose, and this is his memory of those opening words from some anonymous male screenwriter.)\"There was a land of cavaliers and cotton fields called the 'Old South.' Here, in this pretty world, gallantry took its last bow. Here was the last ever to be seen of knights and their ladies fair, of master and slave. Look for it only in books, for it is no more than a dream remembered, a civilization gone with the wind.\"So much better are the novelist's own words, distilled into so many sentences and paragraphs that positively 'sing' in our memory. Like this one:\"He swung her off her feet into his arms and started up the stairs. Her head was crushed against his chest and she heard the hard hammering of his heart beneath her ears. He hurt her and she cried out, muffled, frightened. Up the stairs, he went in the utter darkness, up, up, and she was wild with fear.\"Or this:\"Hunger gnawed at her empty stomach again, and she said aloud: \"As God is my witness, as God is my witness, the Yankees aren't going to lick me. I'm going to live through this, and when it's over, I'm never going to be hungry again. No, nor any of my folks. If I have to steal or kill - as God is my witness, I'm never going to be hungry again.\"-----I have often thought that \"age twenty-six\" is the single most important year of any long and healthy lifetime (for too many subjective reasons to list here; but think of the athletes or musicians we've admired when they were at the very summit of their game -- in their twenty-sixth year). So it comes as no surprise to learn that Margaret Mitchell was at that same magic age when she began work on this --- the book another great novelist of the last century would term \"this long and powerful recollection of her home town - destined to become a titanic tale of human passions, loved around the world\" . . . (its astonishing impact) \"a mystery then, and remains one now.\"",
            "Growing up in Georgia, I've had a first hand look at the American South. After reading Gone with the Wind, I realized the South hasn't changed that much. We don't have slavery anymore but the lifestyle and traditions remain much the same. THAT is what makes Mitchell's work so enlightening. She relates the Southern Culture better than any other writer barring Pat Conroy. She shows the strength, the loyalty, the compassion, and the gumption of a good southern woman. She also relates the frustration and rebellion at being expected to take a backseat service-oriented role in society and especially in the family. But it doesn't stop there. Mitchell also weaves one heck of a story scattered with some of the most unique and memorable characters in fiction. Characters such as Scarlett O'Hara's love interest Ashley, her bestfriend/worst enemy Melanie (Ashley's wife), and of course the sly Rhett Butler. The book is timeless, the story compelling.A romantic at heart, I appreciate the subtleties of the struggle for love unattained and love unreturned, both of which give this story a personal touch. If you are curious to see why this novel is the 2nd best selling book in the world next to the Bible, pick it up and expect a long, complex story with unforgettable characters, a glimpse of a fleeting culture, and prose that tastes like an expensive red wine.",
            "Margaret Mitchell wrote, for her first book (an earlier work, called &quot;Lost Laysen&quot; has since been published), an exhaustingly researched, wide-ranging, exciting and thrilling book set in the Civil War. This book - Gone With The Wind - was a runaway success; and ultimately made into the biggest movie of its day. Alright, let's admit it, by modern standards it's sexist, racist, overblown, and melodramatic. And it's pretty darned brilliant. I have read this book no less than ten times! In theory, one ought to detest that spoiled little brazen, Scarlett O'Hara, but Margaret Mitchell makes her into a vivid, strong human being, a woman with spirit and the will to survive, but who was essentially immature and spoilt. But she was fiercely protective, loyal, and someone who you were forced to admire, even as you disliked what she was doing. She also had a alarming propensity to fall in love with the wrong men - this was a woman doomed to claw her way anywhere to succeed, but at the same time, estranging herself in the eyes of her Society. But does she give up, does she make it a tragedy? No. She gets up and keeps going, she just doesn't let people see that she minds it very much. She is an inspiration, but she doesn't really deserve to be. Scarlett is flawed, hideously so, but none the less, we are forced to admire her. She IS the book. A weaker or less flawed heroine would be irritating or just TOO unsympathetic. Her unrequitted love is very believable, it's happened to most of us at one time in our youth, and we never really quite shake that first infatuation off without a rude or painful awakening.The attitudes which feature in this book, although sexist and racist to us now, were perfectly normal for Civil War Southerners - Margaret Mitchell really understood the way people behaved at this time, and did not make them behave out of period or in anachronistic ways. Like Georgette Heyer and Regency England, she has a true understanding and insight into the period she is writing about - she LIVES it, and her people could have been alive then without unduly standing out as unusual or unremarkable.Scarlett is a rebel, but she does not go as far as a modern author might make her heroine go. She loves her family and her land, though she may deny it, and she is very proud. She is an inspirational woman, a true forerunner of the power woman of the 1980s - a sensational concept, even for the 1930s! The clever thing is how, in such a huge and spreading book, everything comes together. It may seem trivial and unnecessary to discuss Aunt Pittypat's drawing room, or go into the minutae of Scarlett's wardrobe, or to discuss events that happened a long time ago, but believe me, it is all very important in building up a coherent and very accurate (scarily accurate, for 1930s historical fiction - Heyer and Mitchell, as far as I know, were the only authors at this time who really bothered to research in depth for their &quot;lightweight&quot; historical fiction writing.) Gone With The Wind is a masterpiece. It must not be read with modern eyes, but as an amazing study of how people behaved, lived, and survived throughout the Civil War in America on the losing side.",
            "I love this book and have read it many times however this particular edition is missing a page, page 713 has been replaced with page 813, and you don't want to miss a word of Gone With the Wind!",
            "Margaret Mitchell was born in 1900 in Atlanta, Georgia. Throughout her childhood she heard stories of life before, during, and after the Civil War. In the 1920s she suffered a broken ankle. In order to pass the time, and inspired by the stories of her childhood, Mitchell began to write a book. She did not consider herself a novelist and did not think about publication--until 1935, when she impulsively gave the ragged manuscript to a visiting publisher's representative. The rest, as they say, is history: GONE WITH THE WIND was a phenomena. The reading public loved it; even the critics hailed it; and a celebrated film version merely added fuel to the fire. It has been translated into a host of languages, it has never been out of print, and to this day it remains among the most widely-read novels ever written.In hindsight, it is obvious that Mitchell was somewhat overpraised as an artist. She is not a writer who can complete with the likes of Jane Austen or Mark Twain, and she has a distinct tendency to write \"on the surface\" rather than in depth. But she has two great strengths, and the first of these is narrative power. If nothing else, Mitchell was a born story teller with an instinctive grasp of what it took to make you turn the next page; at one thousand pages, GONE WITH THE WIND is a long book--but it never seems long when you are actually reading it. Mitchell's second great strength is ability to create archetypical characters that seem to embody everything you know as well as everything you feel you should have known, and Scarlett O'Hara joins the ranks of Austen's Elizabeth Bennett, Thackery's Becky Sharp, and Tolstoi's Anna Karenina as one of the most memorable female characters in the history of literature. As art, the novel does have faults, but it is vividly, sharply alive. You believe in the world and the events and people that Mitchell presents.Social critics presently accuse Mitchell and GONE WITH THE WIND of racism. I find it difficult to criticize a writer and a work from the past for failing to adopt the attitudes of the present; all writers bring their own day and age to the table, and Mitchell's attitudes and ideas about black people and slavery were in the American mainstream of her day. In this sense, the book is perhaps best considered as a marker of where we once were and how far we have come since its original publication. It is also worth noting that while GONE WITH THE WIND is set before, during, and after the Civil War, and while many of its characters are slaves or freed slaves, it is not a novel about the Civil War or about slavery. It is about a self-centered woman of that era who is clever without being intellectual, who is remarkably hypocritical, and who can in many ways be described as morally bankrupt. We see this world through her eyes, and since she is utterly uninterested in the causes of the war, and even less so in the myriad of moral and ethical issues that swirl around slavery, we learn very little about either in any real sense--and to further complicate matter Mitchell never implies that Scarlett, those who swirl around her, and their attitudes and actions are to admired or accepted; they simply are.This said, social critics do have a significant point when they note that the popularity of GONE WITH THE WIND had the effect of perpetuating the idea that slavery was \"not all that bad\" long after such ideas should have been no longer tolerated. I do indeed recommend the book--it is extremely memorable, so much so that it virtually created the genre of romantic historical fiction without every being bested by the host of novels that followed it--but I do not recommend that any one come to it without a fairly good idea of what the Old South was like in actual fact. It is all very well to see that world through the eyes of Scarlett O'Hara for a time, but we need the ability to pull away from her point of view, and to compare it to reality, once the novel is set aside.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",
            "\"Gone With the Wind,\" as a novel, has been mistakenly dismissed by literary critics as pulp fiction for the masses. This view is premature and biased, in my opinion. If one digs deeply into the fabric of this very complex novel, one is likely to find that this novel works on two very different levels: the external level, in which themes such as survival and romantic love figure prominently; and the internal level, in which themes such as division v. reunion and the child v. the adult figure prominently.An external analysis of the novel yields much that has been obvious to the reading and movie-going public for years. \"Gone With the Wind\" is, most obviously, a very powerful novel about a young woman's survival of two unique crises: the American Civil War and Reconstruction of the South that followed. The personal qualities of those who survive and prosper in this novel -- characters such as Scarlett O'Hara, Rhett Butler, Mammy, Will Benteen, old Mrs. Fontaine, even Mrs. Merriwether -- are contrasted sharply with those who do not survive and prosper: Ashley Wilkes, Ellen O'Hara, Gerald O'Hara, and Scarlett's first two husbands, Charles Hamilton and Frank Kennedy.Melanie Hamilton presents an interesting study in the story of survival. Margaret Mitchell uses her to represent the dignified stateliness of the Old South matron. Rather than becoming a victim of the Old South's disintegration, she survives in a way that equals or even surpasses Scarlett's survival. Melanie, whom Mitchell originally intended as the novel's heroine, is the woman who saves Tara from burning to the ground; the woman who drags her father's Mexican War sword to the landing at Tara, helping Scarlett defend it from the Yankee invader; and the woman who stands against polite society in order to defend Scarlett, her beloved sister-in-law, from the town's gossip. Yes, she dies at the end of the novel, and Mitchell uses this to represent the passing of the Old South. However, even here, Melanie dies in her own bed, in her own home, with her own family about her, and she dies on her own terms: after conceiving a child she knew placed her own life at risk.It is also about three interconnected love stories: the traditional, dignified courtship and marriage of Melanie Hamilton and Ashley Wilkes; the thwarted, unconsummated relationship between Ashley Wilkes and Scarlett O'Hara; and the temptuous, passionate courtship and marriage of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler. The central theme of these love stories is summarized early in the novel by Scarlett's father, Gerald O'Hara: \"Only when like marries like can there be any happiness.\"These themes, while universal and very powerful, are only external to the novel, and I don't believe the novel's power or universality are derived from the themes of survival and love. I believe its power is much more subtle. Indeed, for years, it has been a mystery to literary critics why this novel was received equally well by 10-year olds as well as 95-year olds. Therein lies its secret: it is a novel with which both the 10-year old child and the 95-year old adult can identify strongly. It is a novel about children and it is a novel about adults.Every one of the major characters has qualities of both children and adults in them. These are handled subtly, not obviously, and the language of the novel, which I believe Margaret Mitchell crafted deliberately along these lines, takes the reader in this direction. For example, listen to what Scarlett says about men: \"All the men in Scarlett's life, the Tarleton twins, the Calvert boys, Charles, and Frank, she could dismiss with the phrase, 'What a child!' Not Rhett. He was an adult in everything he did. Only Rhett and Ashley ...\"Scarlett is portrayed as both child and adult. \"I'm always your little girl,\" she says to her mother in the middle of the Civil War, when in fact she is a widow with a 2-year old son. The woman whose heroism saves Tara from oblivion is evaluated by Rhett at the end: \"My pet, you're such a child.\" By the end of the novel, when Scarlett is only 28 years old, she has been married three times, widowed twice, given birth to three children, and buried one of them. Yet, in her dreams, she is still \"a lost child.\" When asked if she thought Scarlett ever got Rhett back, Margaret Mitchell said: \"I don't think so, but I do think she finally grew up.\"Melanie is the adult who masquerades in child's clothing -- and has a child's figure. Mitchell takes pain to describe Melanie's physical appearance \"as that of a 10-year old boy, with narrow hips and height barely coming up to Ashley's shoulders.\" Yet it is Melanie who has the wisdom to see Scarlett's finer qualities, her strength of character, her commitment to her promises, and her ability to survive -- wisdom that is ironically viewed by Scarlett (and others) as foolishness. She is portrayed as foolish to be so loyal and loving to Scarlett; yet it turns out, in the end, that Scarlett's attachment to Ashley was imaginary, and it turns out in the end that Scarlett loves Melanie deeply. She is portrayed as foolish for defending Rhett Butler so staunchly, yet her wisdom about his good qualities is thoroughly vindicated by the novel's end. Of all the principles, it is Melanie who is the most wise -- and the most adult. Yet her external appearance is very childlike.Rhett is usually depicted as an adult, the black sheep of a prominent Charleston family who makes his own fortune as a blockade runner from just a $1,000 investment. He admits, at novel's end, that he wanted to care for Scarlett, as an adult would care for a child; yet he is relentlessly mothered by Melanie, especially toward the end: she straightens him up so that he can be presentable to Scarlett after her miscarriage; and only she can convince him to consent to Bonnie's funeral. Further, he enables Melanie's mothering throughout the novel. She is the only person that he truly respects because, I suspect, she is a reminder to him of his own mother, a character who is rather prominent in the novel, though largely absent. Interestingly, it is only Melanie who comes into contact with her, as she greets mourners for Bonnie in the parlor of Scarlett and Rhett's mansion.Ashley Wilkes is the real child of the four principles, but it takes Scarlett the entire duration of the novel, more than 12 years, to realize this. Ashley is the weakest character, the one who has failed to give up the \"life that [he] loved,\" the one who depicts the charm and grace of the Old South to Scarlett -- the only time that she succumbs to the mistake of looking back. Mitchell is very deft with this scene. It is portrayed as a scene that exposes Ashley and Scarlett's illicit love for each other. However, what's really being exposed here is their common dependence on the past, Ashley's being overt and Scarlett's much more deeply repressed. By implication, it's also exposing the true nature of their attraction for each other, because they shared a common upbringing, growing up on neighboring plantations.This scene is expertly crafted. While Ashley and Scarlett are reminiscing about the charm and grace of their common past -- an event which culminates in their hugging in a truly platonic manner, one in which they begin to understand each other -- they are exposed to the gossip and criticism of Atlanta society. What's being exposed here is not their unconsummated romance; it's their common reliance on living in the past. It's fitting that they should be exposed when they're reminiscing about their common past, because that is the real force of their attraction, the real reason for their love (an ultimately childish love, by the way). Mitchell uses this scene to expose them not to Atlanta society, but to the reader. They're not in love with each other; they're in love with a life that is (forgive the cliche) gone with the wind. At the end of the novel, when Scarlett realizes she truly loves Rhett, she sums up her relationship with Ashley: \"I've lost my lover and I've gained another child.\"Virtually every relationship in this novel can be evaluated as child v. adult; think, for example, of Mammy, the real mother figure of the novel. Look at Ellen and Gerald O'Hara; he was 43 when they married and she was 15; yet she mothers him, right up until her death. Consider one of their final episodes, recounted to Scarlett in Atlanta by John Wilkes, in which Gerald wanted to fight in the war. Ellen puts him to the test insofar as riding his horse is concerned, a test that \"little Gerald, who barely came up to her shoulders\" failed miserably. After Ellen dies, Gerald's life collapses and he is a broken man, right until his death.Finally, there is the theme of division and reunion that appears on numerous occasions throughout the novel. Consider how the novel starts: Scarlett is seated on the front steps of Tara between the Tarleton twins -- a divisive force for two brothers who are otherwise as \"alike as two bolls of cotton.\" The novel begins with internal and external symbols of division. The Civil War starts. We are introduced to Scarlett and Melanie, the two heroines who are complete opposites and, at least for Scarlett, adamantly opposed to one another. We are introduced to Ashley and Rhett, the two heroes who are also complete opposites, at least externally, and rather opposed to one another; Ashley dislikes Rhett's blackguardism, and Rhett has contempt for Ashley's weaknesses.Mitchell deliberately tries to convince the reader, by cleverly contrasting their external characteristics, that these characters are hopelessly divided. Scarlett \"hates\" Melanie because she is a foolish simpleton and Ashley's wife; Rhett is a symbol of the New South, and Ashley is a symbol of the Old South; Rhett is a survivor, Ashley is a victim. Scarlett is a divisive figure in Melanie and Ashley's marriage. Scarlett is a divisive figure in the Hamilton-Wilkes families: toward the end, she is the indirect cause of a family feud that splits the family into two separate camps. Scarlett, herself, is a divided character - the result of an alliance between an Irish immigrant and an established aristocrat from the Savannah coast. \"In her face were too sharply blended the sharp features of her father, an Irish immigrant, and the more delicate features of her mother, a French aristocrat from Savannah.\" Mitchell has even put division on Scarlett's face -- one reason that Vivien Leigh, who as an actress utilized divided eyebrows (one up, one down) for Scarlett, was such a perfect choice for the part. \"She is my Scarlett,\" admitted Margaret Mitchell.Division is the premise of the novel. Reunion is its conclusion. Everything that was divided is ultimately united by novel's end. Melanie and Scarlett reach an understanding with each other; Scarlett comes to realize how much she loves and relies on Melanie, and comes to appreciate her strength, the \"steel courage\" that has sustained her through many crises. Indeed, the evolution of their relationship is one of the most touching and endearing aspects of the novel. Whereas we begin the novel with Ashley depicted as the war hero whose life is lived for \"dignity and honor\" and with Rhett depicted as the blackguard who is motivated only by crass selfishness, we end the novel with Ashley reduced to a helpless, purposeless victim and Rhett enhanced as a loving husband and father. Along the way, the stark contrasts that Mitchell draws early between Rhett and Ashley yield to sympathetic comparisons. \"Did it ever occur to you, Scarlett, that Rhett and I are fundamentally alike?\" Ashley inquires toward the end. Yet their similarities are evident -- though repressed -- from the beginning. In a surprising confrontation with Mrs. Merriwether, Melanie defends Rhett's criticisms of the war because they mirror things her husband has written to her. Ashley and Rhett begin the novel as divided and opposed to one another; they end united and unified as characters. Melanie and Scarlett, likewise, begin the novel as opposed opposites and end the novel united and unified. Division begets reunion.This theme, division and reunion, is especially powerful when you consider the historical context of the novel. In my view, it is no accident, but rather a careful decision on Margaret Mitchell's part, to time the action of the novel from April 1861, the start of the Civil War, the ultimate symbol of division, to September 1873, the end of Reconstruction, the ultimate symbol of reunion. It is a breathtaking historical backdrop for a novel whose dramatic power is derived from characters experiencing division and reunion in their lives.It is curious that Mitchell's novel has born the brunt of belittling and contemptuous literary criticism over the years. When it debuted, it sold millions and won the Pulitzer Prize; no film, before or since, has ever been so widely anticipated as the 1939 film was. Its massive popularity, I suspect, and Mitchell's melodramatic writing style have contributed to this contempt. However, when one considers the thematic breadth of the novel, its impeccable structure, and the awesome scope of its narrative force, \"Gone With the Wind\" is a singular and astonishing achievement. I believe its universality, its appeal from the 10-year old to the 95-year old, is best explained by the themes of child v. adult and division v. reunion. I also believe that it is these themes that explain why it captivates us after 71 years and will continue to captive generations to come.",
            "I saw the movie before I read the book, and I thought it would be too much to read a book that was so long. But I was enthralled by the 2nd page, by the descriptions and the dialogue. The rest of the novel kept me enthralled because of the unconventionality of Scarlett and Rhett, and the messages about war, the finished past and the unavoidable future of the South in the mid-1800's. I loved the richness of the descriptions of the Old South, which made me feel so nostalgic even though I'm not even from the South! Also, I found the many characters to be well-developed and each major character had a distinct and sympathizable personality.My favorite parts are the ones with Scarlett and Rhett at each others' throats, before and during their \"courtship\" and even after they were married. Their dialogue is hilarious and clever, though admittedly the wit is all from Rhett and the amusement comes from seeing Scarlett brought down a few notches. Though it hurts to know that even though Scarlett FINALLY matures enough to dump Ashley and realize she needed to change, Rhett is no longer willing to give her another chance. It seems whenever Scarlett is actually sincere about something nobody believes her or is willing to give her the benefit of the doubt (except Melanie of course). What's great about the novel is that if one was one of the characters, he would just see Scarlett on the surface: selfish, conniving and coy, but with the narration, one can see where Scarlett is coming from, and actually sympathize with her actions. She was definitely a woman born in the wrong era. She would do just fine in the 21st Century.Scarlett is very much my favorite character, because even with her insensitivity, selfishness, and materialism, she is oftentimes the strongest person in the passel of main characters. She worked to the bone when she returned to Tara, knowing that her hands would have to be ruined in order to eat and live and provide for the family that looked to her for leadership. Sometimes it seemed she was the only practical, level-headed person in the whole book (excepting Rhett), especially since people like Suellen were just refusing to work because it was \"beneath\" them, refusing to admit things have changed and work had to be done. Scarlett knows what she wants and has the sense to go ahead and try to get it.Although, many times Scarlett's selfishness comes up so unexpectedly I burst out laughing at the outrageousness of her personality. For example there would be a long conversation or narrative about how the past was so beautiful and peaceful or about a nice thing a person has done, and the book has Scarlett completely overturn the comments with her contemptous thoughts on the contrary of what was just described. Her problem is that though she sees what's in front of her, she doesn't get the POINT of what she's seeing. Hence the character of Rhett. He is so much like her, but he is able to see what she misses. He points them out to her plainly, and in Rhett Scarlett meets her match. He has what she's missing. As a result, another piece of the novel comes together: through Rhett, Scarlett is able to mature and bridge, to an extent, the gap between the ideals of people living in the past and those living in the present. Unfortunately, this maturation is not without consequences.Because of Scarlett's headstrong personality, I found GWTW endlessy amusing, and I think it was meant to be - in showing the huge gap between the over-the-top, in-the-moment practicality of Scarlett and the immaterial dreams of yesterday held so tightly by Old Southerners like Ashley, Melanie, and the rest, Mitchell tells us that both ways of thinking have their benefits and faults. It's not good to hold on to the past without moving forward, but only worrying about current physical security without holding tight to family and identity will cause pain and loneliness in the future. The messages are many in GWTW, and none of the 1000+ pages are superfluous. It was a pleasure to read, to laugh at the witty dialogue, sigh with sadness or nostalgia, scoff with annoyance at characters' actions, and feel the pain of the bitter ironies that define the lives of characters like Scarlett and Rhett.GWTW is not just a love story to me; it's so much more than that. It makes you think about what's past, but warns you not to dwell on the memories. Also, issues about war, race, and gender are definitely touched upon, oftentimes subtly, and it makes for great analysis. I can see why this novel won the Pulitzer Prize. Many issues are laid out all at once in front of you, forcing you to acknowledge their presence, whether it's painful to do so or not. \"Gone With the Wind\" made it to my \"favorite books\" list by page 150. It's an amazing literary work; a real masterpiece.",
            "GWTW was the very best. I always thought that there was no way that a book could really touch me, emotionally I mean. This was the only book that could accomplish that. Magaret Mitchell did a superb job writing this book, and I think that there never should have been a sequel written, for no continuation of the story could match the excellency of GWTW. I felt that the book ended well, and that if it had ended as a 'happily ever after' sort of thing, it wouldn't have been believable at all. Although I was crying at the end, I do believe it turned out correctly. I could not put it down! GWTW is timeless, and applies to everyone, so I recommend this book to every single person out there. Everyone can relate to the charecters in this book. A true classic, you've gotta read Gone With the Wind. I doubt I will ever find a book that can compare with the quality of it! Read it. PLEASE! We can all learn a lesson from the charecters in the book, especially Scarlett O'hara. A must read!",
            "This book has created intriguing characters. But the main characters like Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett are admired and glorified to a fault. Scarlett O'Hara is tough, practical and no-nonsense. But in essence, she's a villain with these qualities. She steals her own sister's boyfriend, emotionally abuses her children, marries men for money and spite, and cheats on everyone and anyone. Seems there's nothing she would not do for money and for herself. Surely she has certain qualities that are needed in a war to survive, but it's not the war that made her selfish to the core. It simply brings out her selfishness on a larger scale.",
            "I love this book. Scarlett is cunning and manipulative and sometimes ridiculous. But for all her flaws, she is a survivor and incredibly strong. Her story is beautiful, perfectly balanced and perfectly written.I so wish that Margaret Mitchell would have written more. Apparently one perfect book was enough for her, but it wasn't enough for generations of her fans!",
            "I've been pressured to read this book since about 5th grade. Everybody in my family has read it. I thought, \"What's so great about this huge book about the war? Boring.\" I finally picked it up this year. Definitely not boring.16 year old Scarlett O'Hara was not necessarily the most beautiful girl in Georgia, but her emerald eyes, 17 inch waist, and stubborn yet flirtatious attitude attracts all the men except Ashley Wilkes. The one man she thinks she truly wants. She has almost the perfect life; living on a huge plantation named Tara, and she's finally old enough to wear gorgeous dresses to various parties. She has the perfect slave, Mammy, keeping her in check throughout the story. Ashley has a party at his plantation, Twelve Oaks, to inform the town he is getting married to his cousin Melanie. Scarlett first puts on her flirt into overdrive to try to win him back, but when that doesn't work, she goes crazy breaking dishes and screaming while she should be upstairs napping with the other ladies. A mysterious man with a bad reputation just happened to be watching the whole thing. Rhett Butler. He was not intimidated by her like other men, he just laughed in amusement. But, the marriage does not stop Scarlett from getting what she wants. The Civil War doesn't either, it just greatly impairs it. Scarlett has to figure out how to live off of nothing and still keep her charm with the few men that are even around, not at war. She has to watch everything she loves break down to pieces before her own eyes; her family, Tara, and her wealth.Scarlett is such a brave character. She is a stubborn and selfish American heroine. She always says, \"I'll think about it later. After all, tomorrow is another day.\" This is an inspirational and true statement everybody should remember. People didn't know exactly how wonderful of life they had before the war, before they lost everything. I think all people experience this feeling. The knowledge that nothing will go back to the way it was. Miss Melly acts like nothing happened and hopes for the best. Scarlett on the other hand kept fighting herself and did things even a man wouldn't do to get her life back together again. She started her own business, married men for their money to help her family, and rode in carriages without an escort! That was scandalous and unheard of in the 1800s. It's the stubborn Irish coming out in her. She always wanted the best for herself. Not necessarily the people around her. But then there's Rhett who keeps popping up throughout the book giving Scarlett expensive gifts from Europe. Scarlett despises him for his smirks and smart attitude, but does she find she loves his sarcasm and money? Does she love him or hate him? You don't know until the last chapters.America was not joking when they voted Gone with the Wind as it's favorite novel. A classic. It's definitely a page turner. (All 1030 pages) You get a feeling of the other side of the Civil War. In history books the North was always the good guys. The Confederates hated the Yankees and their ways. I mean, who would want to have to free such devoted and motherly slaves like Mammy?This novel almost makes you mad because it doesn't go the way it's supposed to be. They should go back to being rich and happy! You want to pop into the book and get things all straightened out so it can be a happily ever after ending.I loved Gone with the Wind for many reasons. First of all, it made me realize that people in the old days were just the same as they are now. The characters are so real and have real life thoughts. Scarlett thought, \"If I have to steal or kill - as God is my witness, I'm never going to be hungry again.\" The people are not saying the perfect things at the perfect time like most books. Also, I loved the side stories with Scarlett's sisters, Ashley's relationship, the war, Rhett, the babies, and Scarlett's determination. It truly is one of the best books out there.",
            "Why is this novel the second best selling book in the world? Because every character evokes deep emotion to the reader whether love or hate. The complexity of the personalities written by Mitchell is amazing in itself, but place on top of that a writing style that flows like poetry and you've got in your hands the most fun a person can have with paper. Vivid descriptions of the Southern landscape, the Old South traditions, the Southern gentility, and the graceful way of life pre-Civil War are second to none. I have lived in the South my whole life and much of the lifestyle Mitchell relates in GWTW are accurate and still exist in one form or fashion. The South is the only true culture left in America and this is a window into how it began and what it was like in its peak. Traditions die hard down here but they are dying fast, get romanced by life south of the Mason-Dixon before it gets washed away in a flood of \"progress\".",
            "If you've ever read any classic like Pride and Prejudice you will love this novel. My friend once mentioned this novel was fantastic so I got my hands on a copy. Boy was I surprised to see how long it was and how small the font was. But it was completely worth it in the end. Margeret Mitchell really gets the point through with her novel. All the characters, such as Scarlett, feel so real throughout the whole book and everything is so thoroughly explained that you feel like your actually there. I also enjoyed the history in the book because I'll soon be studying the Civil War at school and this novel really helped me understand it in an enjoyable way.There are also many timeless lessons that are valuable for anyone.So anyone who loves romance, don't mind how long the novel is because in the end it's worth it. I urge you to go out and buy a copy NOW. :>",
            "To put it simply, this is the best book ever written. you have not lived until you have conquered this masterpiece of prose. For some, the length is intimidating, but it goes fast, so dont use that excuse. This book is a romance novel, a war story, a documentary all roled into one. there is something here for everyone.While reading this book, I found myself wishing so badly to be more like Melanie. Unfortunately, I am more of a Scarlett myself. I suspect most readers, if they are to be honest, would also admit to this. Yes, she is cruel, materialistic, unyeilding and rather spoiled. No, she isnt one to be envied. But still, there is something about her that one cant help but relate to. perhaps its because we watch her grow from a careless young lady to a hardened, stubborn adult. We know her story. we know her hopes and her fears and what drives her so far, and we cant help but admit that if we were in her shoes, wouldnt we have a similar response? all the same, one feels very little sympathy for her in the end, as she loses everything that matters, and is left with nothing but her money.Rhett, as another reviewer said, is certainly the tragic figure in this story. He is ultimately driven to accept the lifestyle that was originally so repulsive to him and that he worked so hard to avoid. ah, but for some there is some pride to be found in not being recieved! He loves Scarlett so much, yet due to her blindness to her own emotions, and the general reservations between them, their marriage fails. He tries to pour all the love and emotions he would otherwise show Scarlett onto Bonnie blue, but when she dies, there is nothing left for him. Its ironic, hes a big man, a strong man, a man to be afraid of...yet one almost cant help but to pity him.Great book.Read.",
            "Published in 1936, can any serious reader expect Gone With the Wind to mesh with 21st-century sensibilities? Of course not. Therefore, it may be wiser to open this book, put sensibilities aside, and let it rip because Gone With the Wind is simply a classic. Margaret Mitchell's Confederate sympathies hold little in the way of ambivalence. The dream-like plantation lifestyle, it's total devastation, and the abject humiliation of it's adherents under Reconstruction are starkly protrayed. Amidst the tragedy of civil war, Mitchell places a bevy of unforgettable characters whose inner strengths and weaknesses receive vivid definition - the interplay of which is truly sublime.Gone With the Wind is ultimately a story of traumatic loss and dogged perserverence, overcoming disaster, peeling oneself off of the cold, hard floor. To be sure, there is wicked condescension, biased justifications, premises so one-sided they defy belief, but through it all Gone With the Wind stands with Tolstoy's War and Peace in it's ability to bring the social costs of war to the surface in a manner both eloquent and disturbing. This book should be read by all. 5+ stars.",
            "GONE WITH THE WIND effortlessly uses the English language in ways I never thought possible, to tell the sweeping timeless story of a strong woman who stuck it out. People who say they don't like her are missing the point. Books are supposed to entertain, not preach. Scarlett may be selfish and stubborn and materialistic, but she is not boring. She lights up the pages with her vivacity. Give me an interesting heroine over a moral example any day.For more great books about Reconstruction in the South (and a girl who is in some ways exactly like Scarlett, and in others her polar opposite) go to littlecolonel.com and read the out-of-print Little Colonel series for free. Offers a new perspective on Scarlett's time.",
            "This is my favorite book of all time. Everyone should find time to read it. I realize it is 1024 pages of very small print and also that there are sixty-three chapters; however it is amazing. I realize too that it is in some cases a bit racist and there are people who are offended by that; to them, I privately say, \"Grow up\". Gone With the Wind is not about slavery. It is not about white supremacy. It is not even really about the South. It is about how war destroys people. You could take it and apply it to any war. I am by no means a white supremist, but those feelings need to be pushed aside while one enjoys such a wonderful book. I do not agree with Scarlett, or Melanie, or Ashley, or Rhett completely, but I can't help but tear up as I watch their world disappear again and again. It is a million times better than a history book to understand the causes of bigotry in the South after the war. As for Scarlett, she is infuriating, bullheaded, selfish, and childish, but I cannot help loving her anyway. Perhaps my favorite lines, though, come from Ashley, lost soul though he is:\"It's a curse--this not wanting to look on naked realities. Until the war, life was never more real to me than a shadow show on a curtain. And I preferred it so. I do not like the outlines of things to be too sharp. I like them gently blurred, a little hazy...It isn't that I mind splitting logs here in the mud, but I do mind what it stands for. I do mind, very much, the loss of the beauty of the old life I loved. Scarlett, before the war, life was beautiful. There was a glamor to it, a perfection and a completeness and a symmetry to it like Grecian art. Maybe it wasn't so to everyone. I know that now. But to me, living at Twelve Oaks, there was a real beauty to living. I belonged in that life. I was a part of it. And now it is gone and I am out of place in this new life, and I am afraid. Now, I know that in the old days it was a shadow show I watched. I avoided everything which was not shadowy, people and situations which were too real, too vital. I resented their intrusion. I tried to avoid you too, Scarlett. You were too full of living and too real and I was cowardly enough to prefer shadows and dreams.\"Everytime Ashley says what he truly thinks, it makes me cry. I never cry about anything, but I cry over Gone With the Wind. It's not that I want to be a part of that world, the pre-Civil War South, because I don't...it's just that Margaret Mitchell's words are magic, creating characters so real that I can't help but long for them to have what they want.",
            "The story begins with Scarlett O'Hara flirting outside her home with the Tarleton twins. The inciting incident was evident when Scarlett finds out that her beloved Ashley Wilkes is marrying that dreadful Melanie. The entire book spans the time of the Civil War and some reconstruction era. Gone with the Wind is a brilliant epic because it's about a love triangle and a young woman who is trying to find her place in the world. The setting is quite vivid, and if you live in the south, you know the heat and the vermillion sky. Of course, to read the book, even the name conjures up the images of Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable. The book itself, a classic indeed, isn't special. The words are verbose and at times rather pretentious. What makes this story amazing are the memorable characters.Scarlett O'Hara is the most obnoxious human being ever, but she's sympathetic. Thebook is at least honest in that it shows her motives. While other characters in the bookmisinterpret her greed and manipulation as strength, the reader knows Scarlett is quite selfish and egocentric. We see her continuous struggle with what society tells her and what makes perfect sense. The reader applauds her tenacity and refusal to accept hardships. Of course, in the book she's only 16.Rhett Butler is also rather vile as a womanizing, selfish renegade with little regard for the ways of high society. He's an older man by the standards of the 1860s at 27. What makes him so special is that he makes it quite clear that he can have sex any woman he wants, but he doesn't want to have mindless sex.He wants someone that interests him, can think for themselves, and he wants their attention. This person is Scarlett. Rhett is a man who knows what he wants. Of course, it's clear to the reader his acts of kindness aren't kindness but manipulated ways to get a hold of Scarlett.Ashley is the contrast to Rhett, a moral and kind man who is drawn to Scarlett but he loves Melanie. Ashley loves the idea of history, literature, and high society. Melanie is Scarlett's contrast. While everyone hates Scarlett, Melanie loves her and that drives Scarlett nuts.At the end of the book, the characters are the most memorable part of the book and considered a classic.",
            "There are few adjectives left, that hasn't been used to describe this book. Someone has written, that all Americans, should read this book, while they still can. The shipping was excellent and the book, is in better condition than described,and at very reasonable rates, an easy 5 Star Rating.",
            "I ordered this book due to the fact that my other one got destroyed....little siblings lol. The book cover is different from the one in the picture. The pic showed a blue cover with a gold like color for the title. The cover on the book I now have is of a man (Rhett) holding a women (Scarlett in his arms.. The book arrived a few weeks after having ordered it but thats ok. I wasn't about to allow my bookshelf to live out its life w/o having one of America's best classics on it. The book arrived in good condition and Im happy:)",
            "Bought this as a request for a friend who had seen the movie and wanted to have the book as part of her Margaret Mitchell collection. Buying from Amazon guaranteed that the item was shipped on time, well packaged and equally was budget friendly.",
            "I read this book in its entirety when I was 13 or 14, and of course I know far more now than I did then. I feel that if you can read this book with its historical context in mind and just appreciate it as a period piece and an exciting story, you'll be fine.I was thinking today about the fact that I read this book shortly after I read Little Women, the story of the March sisters whose dad was fighting the Civil War as a soldier for the Union. The contrast is great because while Alcott's book is filled with so many upstanding citizen types, Mitchell's story is peppered with the roguish Rhett Butler, the self-centered Scarlett, and an assortment of amoral characters. A few stand out as worthy of admiration--Melanie of course, Scarlett's mother, and Scarlett's beloved Mammy.I don't recall this book with the sentimentality that I hold for a simpler classic, such as Little Women. I loved the excitement, the adventure, the ironies. It thrilled me when Scarlett delivered Melanie's baby all by herself and when she said, \"As God as my witness, I'll never be hungry again,\" and proceeded to pick cotton in the fields like a \"common field hand\" as I think she put it. Her crush on Ashley thrilled me, and their long-awaited kiss was well worth waiting for! Somehow I couldn't quite cotton to the roguish, worldly Rhett and so their romance didn't thrill me, but nevertheless I was crushed when he abandoned her at the end. I remember asking my mom, \"Why?\" I just didn't understand why he couldn't have forgiven someone he supposedly loved so much.Just as in Little Women, I loved hearing about the fashions and balls. I tried to imagine what it would have been like to have been as popular as Scarlett! The obsession with thinness, so similar to our world with all the Jennifer Anistons today, interested me greatly. Imagine a 17-inch waist!I doubt whether I understood fully why she kicked Rhett out of her bedroom when she discovered that her waist measured a full 20 inches, leading her to the decision to stop having babies after Bonnie. And I'm embarrassed to admit that I thought Bonnie was a spoiled little girl, a miniature Scarlett, and I didn't cry when she died. But I cried when Melanie died, the woman who Scarlett had looked down upon all her life, only to finally realize that she was a great person.So much drama, so much excitement--wasn't it Melanie who suggested to Scarlett that they search the Union soldier's pockets after Scarlett had killed him when he entered Tara? I'm not sure but I remember that scene vividly from both the book and the movie when they realized that they'd both be raped by the home invader if they didn't do something fast!When I read this book as a young teen, I'd never read anything quite so adventurous or sophisticated. I'd never even seen the term \"sexual intercourse\" in print before, and now I was reading that Scarlett liked kissing, but marital relations didn't really appeal to her. My first adult book and I ate it up.If you can get past your hatred for the glamourization of slavery and see this book as a story from history, it's quite a fascinating tale. I mean who else but Scarlett O'Hara would fashion a dress from drapes and go to visit Rhett in jail in the hope of seducing him and achieving financial security for her and her family. Forgive me, but I can't help but picture Carol Burnett doing a skit as Scarlett, wearing the drapes, rod and all!This book probably deserves five stars just because it's a grand epic, but I need more of a love story, more inspiration than I found here. When the final words of a book are, \"Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn,\" this is too harsh for me.",
            "I fell in love with Gone With The Wind at age 14 when my mother gave me a copy. Now--many decades and books later--it is still my favorite book ever. I realize that it may seem dated to 21st century readers. But it was written in the mid-1930s, when society was vastly different. No other book has ever captured my imagination like GWTW. And Scarlett O'Hara Hamilton Kennedy Butler is hands-down my all-time favorite character. Yes, she was vain and selfish and willful, and spent years deluding herself about Ashley Wilkes. But she was also very brave and intelligent (and beautiful). While the rest of her family sat back bemoaning the past, Scarlett literally saved Tara. In my opinion, she was a surprisingly modern woman who, unfortunately, was ahead of her time. She lived in an era when strong, independent women were not acknowledged or respected... and for this, she paid a high price.Even though I loved Vivien Leigh's portrayal of Scarlett, I much prefer the book over the movie. GWTW is a book that can be revisited over and over again. I know I'll never get tired of reading it.",
            "Probably one of the very greatest fiction books of all time. Ms. Mitchell wrote a classic here with all the details of the Civil War enmeshed with Scarlett O'Hara and her tempetuous personality. Made into the movie in 1939 (and won the Best Picture Oscar that year), the book offers no disappointments. A true classic!",
            "I love Gone with the Wind it is my all time favorite book and movie. I found the movie edition on Amazon and just had to get it. The binding is coming off and I have to find someone who can fix it. But it is a great addition to my book collection. I am actually afraid to read it. It is sitting next to my copy of Rebecca of Sunnybrooke Farm movie edition book.",
            "This novel singlehandedly got me addicted to reading! I thought I didn't have time in my busy schedule, but now I make time! I never wanted this book to end!",
            "I had always been a fan of the movie adaptation of Maragret Mitchell's \"Gone With the Wind\" but I had never gotten around to reading the book (I know--BAD READER!) so when I saw audible had a version of GWTW available, I decided to try it out. It's a long book but I figured my familiarity with the story line would help me through it.Why did I wait so long to read this book--it was wonderful! So much more than the movie, with additional detail and real perspective on the characters. Those overwraught emotions make so much more sense after reading the book! Although there is a rich historical background in this novel, it's really about one woman's struggle against herself, her time, and her enemies.I also really enjoyed the narrator of this audio book. She did a wonderful job of bringing the story alive and giving depth to the different characters (with different voices and inflections) and had a wonderful way of telling the story.If you are a fan of GWTW the movie and have never read the book, I urge you to get out there and find a copy. You won't be disappointed with this rich historical drama.",
            "Mch more interesting than the movie.There is more character development,you understand why some people did the thingsthat they did",

            "It has been a long time since I read GWTW and hated Scarlett. I reread it with an adult's perspective of hardships, tough knocks and suffering, and while I still don't like Scarlett, I've come away with a greater appreciation of the hardships of living in an occupied land, 19th century societal expectations of women in the U.S.; and the tumult of changing social norms from one century to the next. It is a fascinating read.",
            "I can't believe it took me this long to get around to this book. It is honestly the best book I ever read.",
            "I remember reading this book a long time ago because I liked the movie. The book is definitely better. It's a very long book, over a thousand pages but a good story about love and determination.",
            "I fell in love with the movie first, so I thought i would give the book a try. For those who loved the movie, the depth of the characters and complicated feelings it brings, the book is even better. I love that it gives insight into characters that the movie doesn't have a chance to expound on.I always finish the movie wanting just a little more. The book helps satisfy a bit of that. Even having seen the movie countless times, the book was still a page turner.Some are offended at the glorification of the south and the misrepresentation of slavery in the book. I don't think it's wrong to find the perspective represented as very idealistic. But maybe take it more as a book written from the warped view that some probably had about their relationships with their slaves. It really is about the end of a civilization and their entire way of life.",
            "It is a wonderful classic and I enjoy it so much I savor the time I get to read it. It goes so much faster on my kindle.",
            "This copy is pretty much what the First Edition looked like in 1936 and it's easy to see how it got to be so big. Not until The Godfather was published had there been so much interest in a book and its inevitable film version. Impresses to this day and you can see the masterwork the film's screenwriters performed in getting this sprawling story onto the screen. I think every American should read this through at least once.God help the pukes making movies in this era who think they need to \"reboot\" this story... Also, don't bother with the \"authorized\" sequels; the story stands on its own.",
            "Great book just as I knew it would be. I can't believe that I've never read it til now. The movie itself is one of my all-time favorites, but they changed quite a few things which bugs me & the book's so much better. I can't wait to read \"Scarlett\" the sequel...",
            "I know this film so well and often quote dialogue but had never read the book. My first purchase on the Kindle and off camping. A thousand pages of southern saga sweeping off the page. It amazed me how the characters in the book are simply written descriptions of the eventual actors. You would recognise Clark Gable and Vivienne Leigh, even Melanie and Ashley like old friends. It was amazing. Also made me understand better a few things in the movie that were not clear to me - the Ku Klux Klan for example.If you are a fan of the movie but had never read the book - do so. It may be from the 1930's but the story holds, as does the film. Well worth the read and a great camping weekend relax.",
            "The color red. It usually represents blood or love. However, Margaret Mitchell uses a little bit of both meanings in her description of Scarlett O'Hara, protagonist of Gone with the Wind. Scarlett represents two of the most powerful human emotions: love and hate. Gone with the Wind is truly classic American literature, as it encompasses such strong emotions and redefines the reader's historical understanding.It is hard to describe the level of feeling one gets from reading this book. Mitchell has loaded her story from cover to cover with strong details that take the reader on an intense voyage of human emotion. The reader can easily become involved in the story through this detail. The feelings Scarlett has for Ashley draw the reader back to his or her childhood. As Scarlett matures throughout the course of the novel, so too does the reader. Love, hate, anger and sorrow are all common emotions everyone experiences, and Mitchell uses her words to draw out these emotions from her readers so that they can truly understand Scarlett's character.They say that history is always written from the winner's perspective. This novel counters that, as it tells the story of the South from the South's perspective. For example, it provides a new point of view on Sherman's march to the sea, showing the way the Southern cities were affected and the feelings of the people living in them. Because the events are familiar to the reader, they stick out and maintain the reader's interest.Gone with the Wind is a classic in American literature, and is a touching story of a young woman experiencing life. Her name reflects her various personality traits, and makes for an interesting story. Everyone should read this book, but make sure you have plenty of time, as it is quite a lengthy book. Also, while extremely touching and a fun read, it can be difficult at times due to the broken Southern used as dialogue. Despite these few drawbacks, the novel is highly recommended to anyone who enjoys curling up with a good book and becoming emotionally part of the story. It is a good story that reflects the many aspects found in the color red.",
            "GWTW is simply the most beautifully tragic work of literary art of the 20th century. Margaret Mitchell not only recaptures a lost shadow world, but she also creates characters of enduring depth and passion. Upon analyzing the characters it is easy to see how Melanie and Scarlett represent the two natures of woman as Rhett and Ashley represent the two natures of man . This two fold nature of man and woman, depicts the spiritual, emotional, physical, and material struggle of each sex. This heart breaking tale is not so much reflective a lost romance, but reflective of the inner and environmental struggle and development of the self and all that it entails.As for the \"sequel\"- yes on a surface level it satisfies those who are seeking closure. But that is the problem. There is no closure and that is what the rightful author intended. It is heart breaking yes, but that in and of itself offers a deep lesson to the reader. The heartbreak emcompasses not just the lost love between Rhett and Scarlett, Scarlett and Ashley, and Scarlett and Melanie- but the heartbreak of a time lost, pride forsaken, shame never to be laid to rest, and the stark reality of future yet known.All in all this is a breathtaking tragic journey that will ravage your heart and soul. Any serious literary reader will find timeless strength in these 1000+ pages of glory had and glory lost.",
            "I purchased several years ago, and I can't remember how many times I have read it. No matter how many times you do, the story always seems fresh. My paperback copy is falling apart, so I think I am going to purchase the hardcover version. My advice is to spend a little more on the hardcover, because once you have read this novel you will be hooked.",
            "What more can I say about this book. Only that it is second to the Bible in greatness and I that could be argued. I have read it before several times and each time I get something diffetent out of it.I was skeptical about getting the audiobook because a bad narrator can ruin a good book. However, Linda Stevens does justice and then some to all the regional dialects and takes nothing away from Margaret Mitchell's masterpeice.",
            "Gone with the wind is probably one of the best books i ever read.(let me tell you first that it took me an AWFULLY LONG TIME to read GWTW because im form mexico, so english is not my language.there were times when i tought i wasnt going to be able to finish it, but i kept on going and i finally did it)GWTW is really special for me because i read it when i was going through some really hard times and it really helped me to not give up.reading about scarlett and all the things that happend to her, and the way she used the people an the things around her so she could get what she wanted was really fun and inspiring.i took for myself her always useful \"charm\" I wont think about it now, ill think about it tomorrow.\" and it has really worked for me. everyone who likes to read a good story should read GWTW. you will grow fond of the characters in no time.the only thing i didnt like about it is that sometimes it can get really confusing , there were parts in the book i had to read twice so i could follow with the story. but in general its a really good book, and i am sure you will enjoy it as much as i did.",
            "This is one of the most memorable lines of all time. And uttered by Scarlett many times throghout the book, give it a fatalistic reality. Anybody who has ever been young, in love, would fall in love with Scarlett O'Hara, the greatest heroine of all time. Her charms are many and so are her bouts of temper, her fears, her desperations, her perceptions of life. This book is simply outstanding in every aspect. Margarett Mitchelle skillfully puts Scarlett's life under the microscope and disects it ruthlessly to give you a clear picture of youth, the pride of youth which is, believe me, terrible to behold, the vanity which rules the day, the plain pigheadedness that early age has and the heartbreak that follows when youth is gone overnight and adulthood encraoches.Don't at all be scared by the lenght of the book, it is very readable. I read this book for the first time when I was 14 and still had absolutely no trouble reading it, that says a lot about its readability. For 6 days I did little else than read with urgency to disclose Scarlett's fate. The book is so splendidly written, so complete in its rendition of that age, that from cover to cover that it encloses a world that is no more and exsists only in those pages. To think that this book was actually written 73 years after the Civil War of America began in 1860, is awe-inspiring in the sense that it seems the author could have had no means about knowing that civilization, the way she does with a completeness that is all encompassing, which was destroyed in that war, had not she been a part of it, saw the sun of those times, breathed the air that blew over Atlanta (where most of the story is based) and had the notions which she shared with those people. This is writing at its pinnacle of magnificience. She staight away begins the story from the word go in a no-nonsense way. There are no lenghty introductions of any kind, no changing in time frames or point of views (we solely see Scarlett's mind in the book though the book is in the first person), no telling about events even before they happen and the retrospection , if any, comes only on the charcters parts.And a very important thing, disbelieve all that jargon about it being in the greatest love story of all time. Infact it isn't a love story at all. Of course Scarlett does fall in love and has crushes that go nowhere, but the aim of the story is not to relate a mushy love affair but what circumstances do to people, how people are changed by the deeds they perform and how thay influence each other.We watch Scarlett fall in love. We watch her love with a passion and pursue her object of desire with a ruthlessness that only extreme youth is calable of. We watch her hate, with a coolness that is chilling to observe, hatred that only can be generated by hurt pride and stained vanity.Scarlett is young and beautiful and rich and brimming with life and health, no sorrow can touch her, and she sets out to conquer the world. Why should she not have everything she wants, every petty fancy fulfilled, every man falling in love with her? We know that the world dosent let such people be, these people invite almost too much jealosy, the world is very cruel to such people. So when the world does slap her across her face, she declares war aginst the world with her head held high. And still she is not a larger than life character, its as you or I would have reacted in such a situation, when you lived in a society in which she lived, if the world in which you lived was falling apart and war arrived at your doorstep. It potrays every kind of emotion a human ever went through and in all its splendor and glory.This story is also about tumultous times. It is the story of the Old South where innocent people lived the life of kings which is only present in memory. They are invincible in their paradise of cotton plantations and tea parties, but when war cuts through their lives like a knife, you can't but feel sorry for these people whose world ceases to exsist, and they live the rest of their lives serching like children for a meaning in their life they know isn't there, for an identity that has been erased, for salvation that will never come. Their inevitable tragedy breaks your heart and set at the heart of this interwining ouilt work of humanity lies the story of Scarlett. We see how she influences people around her and is changed herself in return by what she encounters.All in all the book is a treasure, one of the greatest contributions of America to the world of fiction and a must read for all generations. I recommend this book with all my heart. Read it and you'll thank the memory of Margarett Mitchelle for creating this piece of art.",
            "The book I am doing a review on is Gone With the Wind. This book is by the author Margaret Mitchell. This story is about an independent teenage girl named Scarlett O'Hara who lives in Georgia before the Civil War. She is in love with a boy named Ashley, and plans to be with him but he is arranged to be married with another girl, so Scarlett makes a big plan to make him hers, but before she can do it the Civil War breaks out and complicates everything for her. The front and back cover made me want to read it. If you are a person who loves adventure, suspense, and romance, then you should definitely read this book. This book is targeted for people between the ages of 15 and 70.The good thing about this book is that it has a plot that seems at some points seem irrelevant but are actually very important to the outcome of the resolution. If the book had even more conflicts then it would be even better because the conflicts make the story nail biting like this excerpt from the book. \"Somebody hollerin',\" said Porky uneasily. \"The Yankees are coming! I saw them! Down the road! The Yankees ---,\" Another thing I like about the book is that it has Scarlett, the main character, is a perfect mix of flare and emotions like this excerpt from the book. \"I don't want your advice,\" yelled Scarlett. I think this book has anything that I didn't like but if there were it would probably be the way there are many characters, but it sort of makes the story better, but for me it gets me confused sometimes like in this excerpt of the book. \"Well push Randa off you, Betsy, and hush. Now listen to me Gerald O'Hara.\" My overall opinion off the book is that I liked it very much. I think I like it so much because it contains a plot and setting that takes place in many different locations, it's not just stationary. So again, I think you should read this book because it contains vivid vocabulary, has triumphs and downfalls that make the story better, and has takes advantage of the readers' sense of adventure, and after watch the movie.",
            "A simply superb novel; it has become my favorite book. People of all ages can appreciate this masterpiece; I'm 16 and I couldn't put it down (not for food, sleep, or a six and a half hour flight), my 13 year old sister loved it, my little brother cried at the end, and an elderly woman and her husband, I met on the afore mentioned flight, said to me it was one of the best books of all time. &lt;space>Even though I had seen the movie -which I also love- so I knew what was going to happen, I wept uncontrollably. This is a must have and worth the 1024 or so pages. At the conclusion of this novel, the fact that it isn't any longer is the only disapointment. Reading it is a supreme pleasure.",
            "I agree with the hundreds...wait, millions of people over the years who've enjoyed this classic. Despite her charater not being too sympathetic, Scarlett is a real survivor and that's why we still care for her. If you haven't read the book because you already enjoyed the movie, you are really missing a lot.",
            "Oh, how I suffer for my enjoyment of this book! When I told a prospective lover that this was my fave tome, he recoiled in white liberal revulsion, demanding if I'd read `Roots'. The truth is that I have never read GWTW for the racism, and condemning it almost seems superfluous. I take it as read that this is a work of its time, written in the 1930s which harked back to the days of slavery and the ante-bellum South. A `Wuthering Heights' of the Confederacy, with its two passionate leads and wishy-washy support acts. Margaret Mitchell spend ten years writing GWTW, and it's perhaps thanks to her husband John Marsh, who persuaded her to write rather than read. After all she was an Atlanta journo in the 1920s and not short of a story or two... just what to do with them. The result is a 1000 page plus commotion which spans the years and charts the travels of various types, as they wind their way from having it all to down on their uppers to getting back up again. None more so than Scarlett O'Hara, who, fed up with playing the feminine card (which she nonetheless does to the hilt), benefits from the destruction of Southern life inasmuch as she answers her true calling - to be a better businessman than the boys. For which she pays the price of emotional loss, albeit of her own daft making.MM wrote at a time when many were denied the enfranchisement that we all deserve. And like many other works of the past, she falls foul of the politically correct watershed. But ignore the broadsheet bores if you dare, and see this novel for when it was conceived. And then relish the familiar themes of survival and in love with love and you might just enjoy it.",
            "I actually discorved Gone with the Wind when I was eleven, and it is an interesting story. I was in a race against a classmate to find the longest book in the school library, read it, and pass the test on it before she did. I read it, wondered why they put a book like that in an elementary school, took the test, passed and basked in the glory or beating someone. But when it was time to return my copy to the library I was disappointed, and renewed it three times until the librarian made me give it back. Then, months later I was visiting my grandmother (she lived in Texas, I in Nebraska) and noticed that she had a copy of the book (with a sticker on the front that said 50 cents.). I took it out of the shelf and started to read it, and when my grandma found me reading it, she said she never liked it and gave it to me. Bam. Love at first page. I read it three times and got the sequel from the public library (not bad, but it will never compare to the original), and saw both the GWTW movie and the 'Scarlett' miniseries, before I was twelve.I am always reading Gone with the Wind. My old copy is hidden away somewhere, but I bought myself a new one in slightly better condition. I am in ove with this book. I read it late at night every singe night, and when I finish the book I instantly start again. I have yet to find any book by any author that could possibly stand up to this novel. To anyone to is considering this book but can't decide-buy this book. The money you pay for this piece of writing will be the most well-spent money you've ever given for a book. This is an unforgettable tale with two of the greatest characters of all time. Need I say more?",
            "It's racist and sexist, and some parts drag on a little too much, yet it made my heart flutter with delight. I love it when books make you feel like this one made me. It started off slowly, but 200 pages into it I was hooked.Scarlett, she's self absorbed and as thick as a brick, but some how loveable. Rhett, why he's condescending yet somehow so wise and sexy. And sweet Melly, while she is a goody-two-shoe, she is never annoying, quiet loveable. She has an inner strength. The characters come alive on the pages.Any book that makes me cry is a good book. Oh, and did I cry! THere were parts where I was blubering for ages. In other parts, my heart was racing and I couldn't read the page fast enough.Well, this book offically rocks my socks, and is one of my favourite books, ahead of Jane Eyre and Pride and Prejudice. Why oh why didn't I read this earlier?!? 6/5 stars!",
            "Gone Wind the Wind is famous for many reasons. First, its characters are so deep and certainly born with human flaws. The plot is amazing; it is neither cliche or \"dumb\". Mitchell has done an excellent job in her historical research - it's as if you were really there in that place and era!Scarlett and Rhett are some of the best characters in all literature. Some may hate Scarlett, although I don't know why. She is unique, intelligent, beautiful, and knows what she wants. You can't blame a pretty face for knowing she is pretty. And besides, she is not so superficial or mean as one may immediately suspect - Scarlett is a three-dimensional character who learns many lessons in the end. She is certainly amusing and vain, and you have to love her for it!Although I did not like the ending at first, it now occurs to me that it was reasonable. Scarlett has made a lot of mistakes, and you can't blame Rhett for not wanting to put up with it all anymore.I know most people will enjoy this book, and it is not racist. It appears to be to the ignorant mind, but you have to understand that people spoke and behaved in such ways at this era. You cannot have black people and whites living in harmony during the Civil War, 1860's, right? This is a historical novel. And besides, doesn't anyone remember that Scarlett mentions how her black nanny is always there for her, is trustworthy and good? She does not disrespect African Americans.",
            "I read over 150 books a year, and I always have read a lot. I don't go for romance at all, but this book is so much more than that. The writing is fantastic. The vocabulary is diverse. The imagery. The characters. The plots within plots. You are there. You know the characters intimately. This is the most amazing work of fiction I have ever laid eyes on.I'm not big on re-reading things, but I've read this novel many, many times. Buy it. Read it. Treasure it.If you're \"offended by the racism,\" please try to keep in mind that political correctness will destroy your education. And whether or not this book is racist (can a _book_ be racist?) does nothing to diminsh from its genius.",
            "There were times in this book when I would be so absorbed in the story that I lost all track of time and would be surprised to discover that things had changed about in my house because everyone else was continuing on with real life.This book is so vividly portrayed. Sometimes you can almost feel the heat, hear the flies buzzing, smell the smoke from the burning buildings, hear ladies in fancy shoes schlooching through the mud.This is an epic classic. The story follows Scarlet, a hard-bitten-or-is-she Southern belle, as she goes about the process of living just before, during, and after the Civil War. It's an amazing book for any number of reasons. One, a woman writes about war and just about blows the socks off the idea that only men can do that. Two, nearly every character you meet is a well-developed person, not just some caricature. Three, details of life like cooking, nursing babies (yes, breastfeeding...), eating, dressing, flirting, dancing, everything is there. I'm surprised there isn't any toilet scene, so much is covered here. Four, tragedies of every sort occur, from Scarlet and Rhett's love story to Scarlet and Ashley's love story to Scarlet and Melanie's friendship to the loss of Bonnie. So many things happen.If you ever thought that the Civil War was a right and just war and that the South got what it deserved, consider reading this just for the opportunity to challenge your conventions and long-held beliefs.",
            "&quot;There was a Land of Cavaliers and Cotton Fields called the Old South. . .Here in this pretty world Gallantry took its last bow. . .Look for it only in books, for it is no more than a dream remembered. A Civilization Gone with the Wind.&quot;What other words could more perfectly describe the saga of Gone with the Wind?I am always astounded when I think that the 1024 pages of Gone with the Wind was Margaret Mitchell's first book! How can a green author roll so much passion, hope, strength, love, steadfastness, despair and humanity into a single novel? I blows me away, no pun intended!As reviewer kitam57 said &quot;I love Scarlett and yet at the same time I want to wring her neck.&quot; I totally concur, I admire Scarlett for her determination, her dedication to her family, her love of the land and her uniqueness. I'm more than half Irish and I too have a love for the land I live on just like Scarlett developed for Tara, as her father said &quot;It's the only thing that lasts&quot; and truly, even when Scarlett had nothing else she still had Tara and was willing to do anything, even prostitute herself to Rhett in order to keep it. She wasn't afraid to go out and break many of the social conventions of the time, like peddling lumber while pregnant, in order to take care of her family and loved ones. But at the same time, I HATE her treatment of Rhett, Scarlett had one giant blindspot by the name of Ashley Wilkes. Although, Ashley did lead her on, he never would say that he didn't love her and only loved Mellie. Scarlett clung to this hope, she pretended to hate Rhett the whole time and really deep down she knew she always liked him. I just can't understand why Scarlett thought she loved Ashley so much, he was dreamer, lost in books, music and Europe while Scarlett was practical, living for each day and facing up to harsh realities without a second thought.Rhett was always hopelessly in love with Scarlett too. It breaks my heart every time I see him try in the book and she just blows him off. When he was released from prison he ran straight to Scarlett to make sure she had enough money to keep Tara, when Scarlett tells him she's pregnant again he's so happy, and when he thinks Scarlett will die I cry too when he is nearly crazy with grief and sobbing into Mellie's skirts! There was still a chance for them later if she had just opened up and admitted that they had both been wrong! And that &quot;hungry&quot; look of Rhett's that Scarlett was always a bit scared of, it was really Rhett's starvation for love. He was watching her, waiting and hoping that she might show him some sign of love, as he said he wanted when they first danced together. Rhett's weakness was Scarlett and his need for her love, for once in his life he wanted someone to TRULY love him, not look down on him! And then tragedy enters in.Rhett of course has his scoundrel tendancies, but I admire him also for his rebellion against social conventions, he wasn't tied in by stupid traditions. he was more thinking than the rest, in that respect he and Ashley were more alike. Rhett and Ashley both knew what a war would do to the South and what a disadvantage they were at with troups and artillery. As Rhett said: &quot;I seem to be spoiling everyone's brandy, cigars and DREAMS of victory.&quot; Rhett's humanity always shows through in his admiration of Melanie, she was the one person he always treated with absolute sincerity and genuine respect.There also is the war aspect, Margaret Mitchell seems to have examined every tiny detail of the the South both during and after the war. She knows of the hardships, devastation, the starvation, the struggle, the indignities and humiliation of Reconstruction. One must always remember that just because people owned slaves, it didn't mean they were all bad people. Some were, we all know of the atrocious horrors that slaves suffered but, Margaret Mitchell shows the almost family-like relationships some people shared with their slaves. They do talk down to them and treat them as children, but slaves were not always educated at the time and therefore some didn't know how to act any differently. Mammy however is the perfect example of the smartest woman in the whole book! She always knew what was going on and loved Scarlett as her own child no matter what depths Scarlett sank to.I love the movie as well, Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable were Scarlett and Rhett brought to life, it's like they were born to play those roles! My only complaint is that they should have shown Scarlett's children with Charles and Frank in the film! However, I will always applaud the scene of Scarlett and Rhett dancing around in black amongst all the other colorful people. They are declaring their defiance and I completely admire that! In fact, I love the story of Gone with the Wind so much that I named my horse India after Ashley's sister. Next one I should name Scarlett! :)All in all, Gone with the Wind is a book for all time, no matter what your genre of book is, you will be able to appreciate it for the many dimensions of it and the ultimate truth, history, life lessons and basic human tenacity it portrays. No matter who you are, where you live or how old you are.",
            "What can I say? I am so glad to finally and proudly join the GONE WITH THE WIND readers. I have tried reading this book for years. I am SO glad I put nose to grindstone. Once I got into the story I was reading every chance I could get. And now that I am done, I am rereading snippets ... not willing to let the story go yet.What a miraculous book, a miraculous accomplishment, a masterful writer. The writing is eerily alive. Simply a brilliant brilliant work.The book is very true to the times. I have read many first hand accounts of that era, including hundreds of Slave Narratives and Margaret Mitchell told it like it was. To say this book is racist is just plain stupidity.We shouldn't read history because it's just not nice, it's just not the way we would do things, us being such enlightened souls.Waaah. Waah.How stupid. This book is about another place and time. DUH. Do a search on Black slave owners and Black confederates if you dare.As far as the human relationships in this book I rode a roller coaster.I personally loved the loyalty shown between slave and owners. &quot;they are part of our family&quot; It's true to the way it really was except the slave narratives are even more emotional and dramatic stating over and over &quot;I just want to go to heaven and see my mastus and missus again. They are the best on the whole world&quot; It's incredible. I am not talking about the selected slave narratives telling all manner of horror. I am talking about he Federal Works project that talked to actual ex-slaves and their families.As for Rhett, I had a hard time liking him. He was dashing at first but his &quot;career&quot; during the war turned me off. His fine clothes and such while people starved bothered me.... But then he proposed to Scarlet and he was so romantic and I started to really like him. I even liked him in the parlor scene when he was drunk and tortured over Scarlet's wandering heart.But by the end I didn't like him much again. I thought it was really scoundrelish of him to simply say &quot;I'm tired of it, I'm tired of you&quot; Frankly my dear I don't give a damn.Him and Scarlet had both sunk so low. I didn't like their long violent fights. It really pained me. When Scarlet was sick ... oh that broke my heart how Rhett cried into Mellie's skirt.If only... If only ...That is a very difficult part to swallow with this book ... and yet it is still a &quot;right&quot; end.I loved Ashley for his Southerness and Melanie was a beautifully wrought character. I wish Scarlet would have proclaimed her love for her more surely though. They could have lain on the bed and recounted all they had been through together.This is not just a book. It is an experience.I am SO glad that Margaret Mitchell wrote this book, a book from the South. I hope it remains in print. A people and a way of life that is Gone With The Wind will always deserve to be heard and understood.",
            "Why didn't I read this magnificent book before I was 49 years old?Perhaps because it tends to be classified in the &quot;historical romance&quot; genre ... because it was a vast popular success ... followed by a blockbuster movie ... it isn't taken seriously as a classic. It wasn't on academic reading lists, while works such as William Faulkner's &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; and Carson McCullers' &quot;The Heart is a Lonely Hunter&quot; were. But it should be.Probably GWTW couldn't have been written at any other time than it was, or by anyone else. When Margeret Mitchell was born in 1900, many living adults had been through the war and reconstruction years, and were there to tell her about it. Hers was the last generation to grow up before radio, when the oral tradition remained vital and dominant. Yet, as a child of the suffragist era and somewhat of a social rebel (engaged once, married twice, etc.), Mitchell's feisty personality is expressed through Scarlett O'Hara with rich comic effect. I frequently burst out loud laughing at Scarlett's outrageously self-serving rationalizations, and the scandalous breaches of etiquette she perpetrates. This is anything but melodrama or bodice-ripper romance. It is sophisticated social comedy, as well as historical drama and tragedy.Scarlett O'Hara, Rhett Butler, and Ashley and Melanie Wilkes endure in cultural memory to this day because Margaret Mitchell takes us into their world so convincingly that they seem real, with all their strengths, weaknesses, vanities and foibles. She has an unerring ear for dialogue. The black servants are vivid characters, pictured sympathetically as generally speaking their minds and being their authentic selves, in contrast to the ego-preserving dissembling and self-delusion of the whites.Despite the entangling of Scarlett's life with Rhett, Ashley and Melanie throughout the story, old Mammy -- the matron of the servants -- is the character who graces both the first and last pages of the book along with Scarlett. She is the only one who never betrays or leaves Scarlett; who stands with her till the end.Books about the Civil War era and its aftermath must number in the tens of thousands. But none brings it alive and lets you see it, feel it and remember it as GWTW does. It is a masterpiece, a monumental achievement.What does GWTW mean to me? At my grandmother's gravesite in East Texas, nearby tombstones cite the deceased's CSA affiliation ... 1st N.C. Cavalry, and so forth. These old soldiers migrated west after the war, just as Margaret Mitchell describes. They were my great-grandparents' generation. Margaret Mitchell brought their world alive to me as no one else ever did or could.Thank you, Margaret Mitchell, for your magnificent life's work.",
            "I can't belive i made it to 30 without reading the novel! I had seen the movie countless times and always liked it. But when I finally picked up the book and decided it was high time I read it, I was blown away. I'm captivated by Scarletts strength and courage, her honesty, and even her vanity. I couldn't put it down and now I'm ready to start all over again. If you haven't given this book a chance, do it now! You'll wish you had read it at 16.",
            "Margaret Mitchell impressed me by writing an 800 page novel about a character I sometimes wanted to strangle but about whom I couldn't read enough. Scarlett O'Hara might be self-absorbed, provincial, and manipulative, but she also displays courage, resourcefulness, and determination. Gone with the Wind is more than just a love story; it chronicles Scarlett's growth from a spoiled planter's daughter to the head of a household struggling to survive the ravages of the Civil War and Reconstruction. Mitchell provides a fascinating depiction of the psychology of the South, which plays a critical role in Scarlett's story. To thrive, she finds she must alienate the remnants of her former life and accept the presence of the Northern invaders. Throughout Scarlett wrestles with her feelings for Ashley Wilkes, a noble refugee from the genteel past, and Rhett Butler, a scalawag building his fortune from the ashes of the confederacy. Many more wonderfully drawn characters fill out this novel, which already feels somewhat compressed despite its length. It's no wonder the movie version is four hours long; the novel has too much too good to leave out!",
            "I have always been a lover of the film, but I am so glad I finally read this book. It was packed with fascinating history and a wonderful set of characters. It is a long book, but definitely worth the effort! Its epic story and beautifully written dialogue paint a picture of the Confederacy, its fall and Reconstruction. This is a story of survival and the pure gumption it takes to get ahead. I recommend this book to anyone who likes a good read!",
            "I saw the movie GWTW as a kid, but the memory faded over time. I never thought to read the book, but took it out of the library on audio CD. What a wonderful, memorable, amazing book. Scarlett, Wrett, Ashley and Melanie are extraordinary portraits, and anyone interested in US history will find much to enjoy with the story set against the Civil War.Linda Stephens audio CD narration is spot-on, painting a nuanced compelling portrait of the characters and story.So worth going beyond the film!",
            "I wish Margaret Mitchell had written more than one book. She was a talented writer and one of the best story tellers. Love her vivid description of war scenes and dialogues. Truly a classic, a great piece of American literature!",
            "I love this book. I love these characters. I love how it's 1,000 pages long, so you don't have to leave the amazing world depicted too soon. I love how you can curl up with this book and read it for hours on end and never come to the last page. It's so completely absorbing, so real and life-like, so undeniably painted, that it's more than classic. It's a masterpiece. I asked for this book for my Confirmation present, and I will cherish it and show it to my children and my children's children. I hope to God that this book is never forgotten. It is simply beautiful and romantic.",
            "I really enjoyed reading this long novel and have to say that I was sad when it was over. Aside from being very easy to read and an interesting story line, the settings in rural Georgia and Atlanta during the civil war provide a realistic historical feel that you don't get from reading history books on the civil war. I have since read a history book on Sherman's march to the sea and realize that the general descriptions in Gone With The Wind about what happened to the residents of Georgia are true. Whether you want a more personal insight into what life was like during the Civil War in the south, or just a really enjoyable book to read, I would highly recommend Gone With The Wind. Also, ignore some of the book covers that make this book look like a love story, it is a book of equal interest to men and women in my opinion.",
            "Scarlett O'Hara was never intended to be the heroine in this novel, but like all dynamic characters, she took over the tale. In reality, Margaret Mitchell wrote Melanie as the heroine, and I think the fact that Melanie shines so gently throughout the tale is one of the many things about this novel that makes it exceptional.Mitchell wrote this novel because she wanted to show how different women managed to survive the American Civil War. Thus, Melanie, Scarlett, India, and Ellen. These women each coped differently to outlive the greatest war of their century in America, and the fact that Scarlett stood so high above the others is a testament to her larger-than-life validity.This novel is, and shall forever more be, my favorite piece of literature.",
            "This book has been a personal favorite of mine since I was in Elementary School. Yes, I was born a book worm with an advanced reading level. I was named for Ashley from this very book and my brother was named for Rhett so I was required to read it, but not required to like it I just happened to fall in love with Margaret Mitchell and her story. It tells so many stories in one and has such an appeal to it no wonder it is still going strong after almost 75 years. I would recommend this book to anyone, although girls seem to enjoy it more as it is told by Scarlett's point of view. Scarlett is the girl you love to hate. She is so endearing and strong but so young and naive that you want to hit her and shelter her at the same time. Rhett is a man's man and women across the world want to have him. He exudes all that is strong and masculine while being head over heels in love with Scarlett and their baby girl. Ashley is a pity case as he is torn and used. Melanie is a personal favorite of mine, like a pet kitten. She is fierce and strong with claws of steel but purrs and mews with the innocence and undying love of a newborn baby kitten. All of the characters are developed well and are all very rounded. You will get lost in this time period and forget what a cell phone is.",
            "At the insistence of a friend, I picked up Gone with the Wind to see what all the hubbub was about. I expected a shallow romance novel, much like the movie it spawned, complete with the longing stares and the yearning desires of a woman who has been spited by circumstance. I could not have been more surprised to find so much more.What I found was a novel that is surprisingly layered. The outermost layer, of course, is the romantic narrative many will recognize, but beneath this superficial casting resides a deeper narrative about the tragic hubris, resulting fall, and struggle to reemerge by a small class of Southern aristocrats. As this historical narrative unfolds, additional layers advance and recede in waves, each ushered in with insightful dialogue and commentary by the book's fascinating characters.At the base of their hubris, for example, is layered an adolescent confidence in the invincibility of King Cotton and the superiority of the antebellum order, which one character ridicules and one character fears will prove all too true. Surrounding their fall, their economic and political naivety retreats before scarcity, Sherman, and a struggle to survive, all of which is replaced by a remarkable perseverance that is more a testament to the antebellum order than anything before the war. As their struggle plays out in the treacherous climate of Reconstruction, it eventually turns into a modest triumph capped by tragedy and accompanied by ominous undertones of the segregated order to come.Other layers abound and while each is fascinating in its own right, together they are interwoven to present an even more fascinating and coherent telling of the most tumultuous period in American history. Rather than shallow, Gone with the Wind is exceptionally deep, its characters eminently profound, and its telling extremely satisfying.",
            "I first read GONE WITH THE WIND many years ago. I read it again every few years. Why not? In spite of the long list of criticisms (melodramatic, insensitive, sexist, racist, materialism, soap opera, etc.) it is undeniably magnificent. Writers, this is a great book to read backwards---last chapter, then forward, chapter by chapter. You will learn a lot about writing if you do this.",
            "This novel is, I'm certain you must know by now, a family saga covering the Civil War and Reconstruction in the South from the viewpoint of a wealthy Southern family who live on a plantation called 'Tara.'Easy to read, 'Gone With the Wind' is not only a family saga, but a fascinating character study of people who did what they had to do in order to survive the devastating war years and the reconstruction that followed. Lives and lifestyles were changed forever with the Civil War. Southerners had to adapt to an entirely foreign way of life and this novel explores how different people coped in the form of well-developed, complex characters.Difficult to put down, this novel is one you will read over and over again and eventually pass down to your children. Don't hesitate to buy a copy!",
            "I love this book. I could read it over and over again. While it isn't very well written, it has the ability to take you there into the story and forget everything going on around you. It gives you a lot more detail then the movie, and makes you understand the characters more. You can really understand the motivation behind some of their actions.",
            "GWTW is undoubtedly an american classic for more reasons than one - sweeping storyline, strong characters and just the flow of simple lucid narrative prose that keeps you going from page to page with sustained interest (not an easy job if it is 700 pages!). I read it a few times when i was young, just fell in love with the movie and it is part of my library collection as well. I still enjoy the color and splendor and perky dialogue although the book is too long to read again with other reasons too.As i grew i figured out what was missing underneath the sentiments we have for it. There is not one word against racism or intolerance or suffering undergone by others during those times. Yes the south lost it all but times and lives change, some cruelly others more slowly with time - it is a natural order of things to change and intolerant lifestyles definitely have to. Lot of people have a longing for good times gone, but it needs to be laced with feelings for what caused it to happen and does not automatically mean bad times have come. I would think hidden beneath the huge popularity of the book so many years after it was made is partly love for simpler times but a lot of guilt for simplistic and intolerant ways of the past that were hidden by economic prosperity and picture postcard lifestyles.",
            "I have watched the movie a zillion times. So since I liked the movie so much I thought I would read the book too. I was amazed how much better the book was than the movie. It goes into great detail and you get the entire story. And since I live in Georgia I'm learning about my culture. And I also found out that not all folks who owned slaves were cruel to them. Actually some of their owners were good to them. And also I fell in love with all the characters. I hate Scarlett but yet I love her too. She is like me in a lot of ways. We are both selfish and spoiled. And we both let our conscious get the best of us. I recommend this book to everyone. It is amazing. I never read a book before until now. I can never put it down. I have now read 4 times and gets better each time. It's nothing like the movie. It's far better!",
            "Gone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell, is a captivating book about the southern way of life in the 1860s. Scarlett O'Hara, the main character in the book, is a young, outspoken girl for her times who lives on a big plantation, Tara. Gone With the Wind goes through the tough times of the Civil War. Scarlett wants a man that she can't have, Ashley Wilkes. She ends up marrying Ashley's cousin, Charles Hamilton, just to spite Ashley, but Charles died in war two months later. She found out she was pregnant with his child and named him after Charles's troop leader, Wade Hampton Hamilton. Scarlett waited awhile before she married her sister's beau, Frank Kennedy. She had a baby girl with him also, Ella. Frank was killed while attempting to kill the carpetbaggers who attacked Scarlett on the way to the lumber mill that they owned. She immediately married Rhett Butler, a urbane man that everyone loves to hate. She has yet another child with him, Bonnie Blue. I would recommed the book Gone With the Wind to anyone because its a twist of romance and survival.",
            "Almost everyone had heard of the beautiful Scarlett O'Hara and the way she can make men weep. The book, Gone with the Wind, though enthralling through 1,022 of it's pages, with it's can't-put-this-book-down events, unexpected turns, tragedies and historical content, has an, in my opinion, very unsatisfactory ending. According to some, it's &quot;The greatest love story of our time. Maybe it is, but the conclusion to the love triangle of Rhett, Ashley and Scarlett was left off as if it were not the end, but the beginning. I suppose it could be argued that you should use your imagination, and that the author wanted to escape those cliche of the studly man living happily ever after with the beautiful damsel but the last two pages left me wanting more. However, if you're the type of person who can deal with not-really-the-end endings, I would really recommend this book. Although it has maybe, an overabundance of pages, Scarlett's life takes many unexpected turns and you sometimes you get so enraptured in the excitement and tragedy that you find that you've read several pages and not even realized it. This book is also full of historical information about the civil war, looking at it from the very different perspective of the women of the south. Margate Mitchell has a way of writing that always keeps you guessing and feed you words of wisdom to live by. Almost like one really long tragic soap opera.",
            "Of course I love GWTW. I have read it at least a hundred times and it never fails to capture me. However, I want to make it clear to those who have children who wish to read GWTW, or if you are a young person yourself, that this is a novel which glorifies the ideals of the 'old south'. And that 'old south' so dearly loved and cherished by the characters of the book is one built with the sweat and blood of thousands of African Americans, and not those who reaped the benefits of slavery. By all means, enjoy this book for its romanticism. However, I think it is imperative that such misguided idealism and blatent cruelty must be treated as such and explained to those who are still rather impressionable.",
            "Gone with the Wind changed my point of veiw on the Civil War and how hard women worked and tried to be ladies. Scarlett worked hard to prevent Tara from being taken away and preventing hunger of her family. My point on the Civil War was southerners were terrible people but GWTW changed changed all that, most people treated their &quot;workers&quot; or slaves as part of the family and were happy. It was the yankee's who were terrible the wouldn't let the south be they had to torture them. The story is very good and if you haaven't read it YOU MUST READ IT.",
            "This book is a definite YES! It's exciting and it keeps you on the egde of your seat. It's so hard to put down! Scarlett and Rhett are such believeable characters and this is definitely the BEST book ever written. I strongly suggest you purchase it or check it out. This is a super book. It gives an exellent portrayal of the south before and after the war. It gives you the south's point of view. I would give it 10000000000000000000 stars!",
            "I absolutly loved GWTW! I loved the way Rhett acted towards Scarlett. In the beginning the way Mrs. Mitchell describes Scarlett is very good and gives you a good idea of the way Scarlett is. Rhett was my favorite character because he was so dashing and handsome. He also was kind and sweet you just couldn't tell most of the time, He was so funny when he was with Scarlett and how he hid his love for her made me sad. Scarlett was really a mean person most of the time, she was selfish and creul to the people around her. It made me mad the way she thought about Melanie, and how she used men to get money or revenge. Ashley was one of my least favorite characters, he was so unrealistic! The Tarleton twins were some of my favorites, they were vivacious and funny and sweet to Scarlett in the time you read about them. I just don't understand how Scarlett could just give up everything she had grown up in to be rich. Its just not right. I loved the part of the story during Rhett's and Scarlett's honeymoon! They were so happy! Bonnie was so like Scarlett it was unbelievable. You could understand why all the people and Rhett and even Scarlett loved her so! But how could she just send Wade and Ella away to Tara that way without any feeling about it. You could totally relate to the characters in the story, it on numerous times made me laugh, cry, mad, and jump for joy! I loved it!",
            "The minute I began this book, it was my all-time favorite. I had just turned eleven when I read it, and a lot of people thought it would be way over my head, but it wasn't. I read it in five days, that's about 205 pages a day. The instant I began reading it, Margaret Mitchell was my favorite author and GWTW was my favorite book. It is totally unsurpassed. It is and will remain a classic forever. Scarlett &amp; Rhett were very realistic, as were the other characters. I've read it several times. Every time I read it, I cry at the end, and at other various places in the book. There are no words that could ever possibly describe how spectacular, wonderful, magnificent, this book is. It is totallu unforgettable. If you read this book and didn't like it, there's something the matter with you, because it's totally lovable. It's impossible not to like it. I couldn't put it down the entire time I was reading. I took it everywhere with me. When I was done, I searched everywhere for the sequel, SCARLETT. I had to wait almost a week before it came in and I was dying to know what happened the entire time. I couldn't sleep some nights, for worrying about how things would turn out. I've been trying to get all my friends to read this great book. Some of them are actually thinking about it. There is just nothing else to say about a book as great as this one.",
            "\"Gone with the Wind\" by Margaret Mitchell is one of my favorite books of all time. Scarlet O'Hara, the foolish southern belle is in love with Ashley Wilkes, a scholar who won't have anything to do with her. To rebel, she marries his fianc&eacute;e' s brother and when the war breaks out, it turns ugly. She is then forced to move to Atlanta to her husband's house. In Atlanta, Georgia during the Civil War things aren't easy. It is hot and sandy. The sticky humidity is horrible to live in yet the feeling of \"home\" is evident everywhere. There are always barbecues and lazy afternoons up till the war. The south is mostly cotton fields, with little factories while the north is full of manufacturing. Things don't look too good for the south when the war breaks out and to make everything worse, the ports are soon closed off. All too soon Scarlet feels the bitterness of war as her childhood friends die for a losing cause. When she finds Atlanta being attacked by General Sherman she must flee for safety and there is nowhere to go.This story is about a girl who has been spoiled her entire life and then must learn to do things on her own. She faces the fact that she can't have everything and that she has to make sacrifices. Her whole life she has been the brat that depends on everyone else so she can't do anything on her own. She is blinded by her own insolence to the truth that nothing is fair. Sweet Melanie, her sister in law is kind to her and is too sweet hearted to see the wrong in anyone; she doesn't see how corrupt Scarlet' s mind is. She is always on Scarlet' s side despite the horrible things that she does. Scandalous Rhett Butler loves Scarlet for her foul heart and chases her throughout the whole book. Rhett has a history for doing unthinkable things to girls. (Unthinkable at the time; refusing to marry a girl he courted, publicly kissing, etc.) Everyone despises him for making a profit off of the war. All proper people support the failing cause and Rhett makes fun of them. He is a businessman, so nothing is personal till he meets Scarlet. As time progresses, Scarlet comes to realize the damage that she has done with her being wicked to everyone. She literally is and was a spoiled brat. Her suffering teaches her a lesson that we all should learn.If you love historical fiction with a little romance, this book is perfect for you. Scarlet is the perfect Southern belle who is incredible to read about. How she attracts men with her charm and little helpless acts is unbelievable. She is used to having slaves serve her and she treats them with little or no respect until she needs them. You cannot stop thinking about how much you would hate Scarlet if she was real, but you can't stop feeling sorry for her and you want to help her to realize how stupid she is.In this book you have a look at how the south was before and after the Civil War. They were still people with feelings, not horrible people who were wicked. You fall in love with the chivalry and way of life. You also realize how wrong slavery was. Even they knew it was wrong, they just couldn't imagine life without the slave labor. I think that the book is written well, you see why people did things and the reasoning behind their actions. I didn't always agree with what Scarlet did, but I knew why she did things. The book is very interesting and I couldn't put it down at all. I certainly would recommend it to just about anyone. I certainly understand the era better now. The book got me interested in other books about the war and now I can see why people felt the way they did. I can see the good and bad in slavery. I feel that lack of education on the issue is what caused such disastrous effects.Emily Norrod",
            "I had seen the movie and while I liked it, I HATED Scarlet. O.k. she's not my new best friend, but I understand her so much more now! And although I knew what was coming, I still cried in certain parts. By the time I closed the book, I thought if Scarlet didn't get Rhett, I would just die! Excellent book! If you haven't read it, pick it up!",
            "This a fabulous book. I think it is much better than the movie. A must for anyone, who loves to read. It is prefect for history fans. I have read and re-read this book many times. It is one of my favorites. It is set in the Civil War era. It is about Scalett O'Hara and Rhett Bulter. It was later made into a movie, starring Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable. Scallet is very independent women, who is famous for her green eyes, and her red hair, that explains her fiery temper. who first gets married to Charles Hamiltion. He's sister is Melanie, who becomes the wife of Ashley, the man, Scarlett wants but can never have. She has a a son, Wade, with Charles. Then she keeps her family together,--anyway she can. She even kills a Yankee. Then she marrys Frank Kenndy, to pay the taxes on Tara. She has a daughter, Ella, with him. He dies while having to Klu Klux Klan. She marrys Rhett. The have a fiery romance. They have a daughter, that Rhett names Bonnie Blue Butler, because her eyes were as blue as the Bonnie Blue Flag. This book closes with Scarlett pronouncing the famous words, \"After all, tomorrow is another day!\"",
            "I loved this book. Very dramatic, great story. However, not having ever seen the movie or read the book, I was expecting a love story. Isn't it called the best love story of our time? They never fell in love! However disappointed, the book was great, well written, a great story. . . not a love story.",
            "My paper back is barely going to withstand another reading since I have nearly worn it out. I actually read the book before seeing the movie. I was very disappointed! The movie made Scarlett seem so evil, but in the book she depicted more as a strong woman who did what she had to do to survive. The only thing that would be better than reading this book again, would be to have the audio version so I could listen to it in the car.",
            "I think that Gone with the wind is the best book ever written the movie is a winner to . I love how it informs you of everything that is going on. You go through the whole book like will Scarlett and Redett get together or will they stay together will Scarlett finally get Ashely. Will they survive the war. Who will live and who will die. You read through the tragides and the good times . I give Gone with the Wind and will argue with anyone who differs.",
            "this novel is coming from others generations for me, at first my mother read it and loved it so now i became interested in reading to, i hope it`s cool because i will spend a long time reading and end up bored will be terible.",
            "First, let me say that Gone With the Wind is possibly the best and most satisfyingly well-written novel I have ever read. To quote Alice Randall, the author of another favorite of mine, The Wind Done Gone, &quot;Above all, Gone With the Wind made me think.&quot;Anyone who gives this book less than three stars invariably does so because of the rampant racism throughout the novel. One cannot say in defense that it was simply the views of the people at the time, because Magaret Mitchell, the author, was not just being historically accurate; she was racist herself.The horror! A racist novel by a racist author! And what's worse, it's one of the best loved novels in America.Parts of this book did make me cringe and leave me angry, namely the roles of Prissy and Big Sam. Yes, those parts were atrocious. But here's a thought:Pretend for a minute that you were born in the early 1900's, in the deep South, with Confederate veterans and aging Southern belles for family. Now tell me you wouldn't be racist. Of course, any middle class enlightened white person would say they'd know better, but would you? I greatly doubt it. Gone With the Wind is fiction, not fact, from the mind of a woman who embodied what her family taught her, no more. Take it and move on. Sure, it's offensive, but it's also wonderful. There are too many layers to this novel for the complexity of it to be fully appreciated in my review, but if you're can't get past the racism to appreciate this book, then I have to wonder what else you're missing in life.What I did when I finished Gone With the Wind was go out and buy Alice Randall's book The Wind Done Gone. It's very thought provoking, and it will mollify a bit of your anger dealing with the bad treatment of blacks in this book. Also, I reccomend The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison, because it deals with the internalized racism that slaves felt in the pre-war South. Beloved is another great one that will show you what the slaves REALLY went through. But don't miss out on Gone With the Wind. Read it, love it, and let it show you the past.",
            "I haven't really heard anything about this book nor have I seen the movie, so I didn't know what to expect when I started reading. I suppose I could use my desire to to broaden my reading scope as a reason for picking up this novel. I haven't read enough of the classics, the heavy stuff, the stuff that should have a good reason for staying around this long.Anyway, this book was teeming with racist undertones, and it annoyed me, to say the least. I could never really get comfortable with the writing, however beautiful and applause-worthy it was, because in would come the worthless diatribes about the slaves and how dumb and shiftless and worthless they were. It's not that the book was written about times of slavery and the aftermath of the American Civil War; I understand that people in those times had their reasons and their own beliefs. (I read Queen by Alex Haley with no problem, although I will concede that Queen was written by descendant of slaves and the view would be slightly different.) But I wonder if the woman who wrote Gone With the Wind was racist--or at the very least more than mildly prejudiced--because she wrote unnecessary addendums when describing the 'darkies,' superfluous ramblings that seemed to be more her own thoughts than the thoughts of the book's characters. She wrote things like, [the slave girl] couldn't comprehend...in her little black skull, and the use of the 'n' word when something else would have sufficed. The way she described Big Sam's excitement in seeing his mistress again after the war almost made my blood run cold. I ran into a lot about how the 'good' slaves all hated the idea of being free and the 'no good free issue' slaves were the ones who, apparently, realized that they were getting a raw deal when it came to that 'peculiar institution.' Really, wanting to be equal to whites [in every way that counted] was such a preposterous idea! I get the feeling I'm overreacting, but that's what happens when you read material like that in times such as these.Another thing that bothered me about it is that this is supposed to be the greatest love story of all time and almost eight hundred pages into the thing, Rhett and Scarlett still weren't together. He loved her--he admitted this to her at least thrice--and she didn't realize that she even really liked him, let alone loved him, until she halfway got over her Ashley Wilkes obsession.My third problem with the book came in the form of one young Miss O'Hara. As much as I tried to remain sympathetic and understanding to Scarlett's plight and her reasonings, her behavior made it easy for me to remain unmoved while reading. While I applauded her moments of unselfishness (very few and far between), Katie Scarlett O'Hara Hamilton Kennedy Butler was a nuisance and she was one of the main reasons I walked away from this book without too much feeling. However, I did love the way Rhett was written, for reasons I cannot properly articulate because even I do not know why I liked him so much. I guess I believe he and Melanie Hamilton Wilkes were the only truly likeable people in this book.The language was beautiful, the scenes vivid, breathtaking and all of that which is desirable when talking books. Ms. Mitchell wrote a really good book but sadly, it's not for everyone to enjoy.",

            "I have enjoyed reading Gone with the Wind. I found the book in great shape.",
            "Gone With The Wind is a classic of mid-twentieth century epic fiction. I read it years after being misguided by Ayn Rand and I was stunned when I realized how closely Rand mimicked Mitchell's prose. Perhaps it was simply the writing style of the time. Mitchell and Rand differ, though, and if both writers create characters that are larger than life, Mitchell's are real while Rand's are pure fantasy.Scarlett O'Hara starts off as a prissy, selfish sixteen year old. She's in love with a beautiful wimp and can't stand losing him to a saintly rival. She marries someone else out of spite at her loss just as the Civil War begins. She's soon a widow and her estate is destroyed, her family in ruins. She marries again to a man with a sound business but no business sense. She takes over his lumber enterprise and gets thing done. She's again widowed and marries Rhett Butler, a man who has all her gumption but whose self interest is tempered by empathy for the aspirations and hopes of others.Scarlett is a fascinating character. She has gumption, she gets things done but has no compassion for anyone but herself. Yet she never wastes any time on recriminations when wronged or when she falls victim to someone else's mistakes; she just moves on to the next task. She has a sense of responsibility, in a way she doesn't clearly understand, and that there are things greater than herself. It is the tension between her inner contradictions that hooks the reader into admiration and that brings about our empathy for her.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo",

I loved this book so much and have read it over and over again, and each time I discover little things that I've missed before.

I will remember more of the story of the Civil War from her story than I ever would from reading a history book. I lived in Georgia for about 4 years and the sense of state-pride was always sort of a mystery to me. Reading Gone with the Wind helped me to better understand the story of the civil war from the southern perspective and better understand the chivalrous culture still present today.",
            "I never tire of reading Gone with the Wind. I just preferred to read the hard back this time.",
            "It is hard to imagine anyone having the nerve to tackle a review of this book, as it is a classic and has already survived any review ever given to it. Suffice it to say that I read it the first time at 16, and it has remained my favorite book ever since. Written by a southerner who grew up on the stories, this novel will entertain and educate you about the Civil War, life on a plantation, and the courage to survive against all odds.",
            "I first read Gone with the Wind as a young teen. It awakened me the struggles of war. As an adult, I can now recognize that M.M. was not a great writer, but she was a terrific historian and knew what she wanted to reveal. She must have read thousands of diaries and letters. Once you accept that there was an impact on the southern women, you can forgive her for what she doesn't say. This is the way it was. This is history.",
            "It is a wonderful story...I love the different perspective of the civil war.It is also funny, witty, and well-written. One of the best love stories of all time.I was sorry to see it end, and although I haven't read the sequel, I am sure it can not do Margaret Mitchell's work justice. The only person who I think could write an adequate sequel is Margaret Mitchell herself.Gone With the Wind is definitely a five star novel.",
            "I purchased this copy of Gone with the Wind because I particularly liked the blue cover. The package arrived safely and in a timely manner. I was pleased with the transaction.",
            "I personally very much enjoyed \"Gone With the Wind\". It was filled with romance as well as peril and unpredictability. I recomend this book for young adults and adults because it is not a kid theme.",
            "I read this book once. Once was enough, but twice would be better. I'm an avid reader, and writer. This book captured every emotion that literary devices are suppose to capture. I found myself crying, laughing, scared, shocked. I've been searching for a book that competes with Gone With the Wind and haven't found one. You know the main characters like they are in your life, and you're taken back to the Civil War. Nothing is downcasted, everything is how it was in the eighteen sixies. Scarlett O'Hara was such a wonderful character, she lives in everyone hearts long after the last page is turned. Even though the book is lengthy, it keeps your attention, truely, until the last page and would keep it further if it were longer. The book was amazing, a true American Literature Classic. I highly recommend this book. You won't be able to find another like it. Gone With the Wind is a true, diamon in the rough.",

            "this paper back book is 2 1/2 inches thick - I certainly have a lot of reading to do! Thanks!",
            "I received the book on time but the back cover was torn at the binding 1/2 way down! I was not impressed with that at all.",
            "I'M FINDING IT VERY HARD TO KEEP READING THE BOOK. I EXPECTED IT TO BE EVEN BETTER THAN THE MOVIE; BUT SO FAR, I'M STRUGGLING TO KEEP READING",
            "I am just really getting started reading Gone With The Wind, so don't feel I have a real handle on the story as of yet. It is good enough to keep me reading and not lose interest.",
            "It was GREAT!!!! I loved the book and couldn't put it down! I read the whole thing in four days (:",
            "This book will make a beautiful gift! It is still nice to have a book in your hands and it'll be very inviting sitting on the shelf",
            "There are a few main factors that fed into how I reviewed the book:1. Scarlett is annoying, not that bright, pretty cruel, and not my idea of a great lady. She doesn't really change for the better and her violent reactions become predictable.2. The story is woven very nicely, though it is extremely verbose at times.3. Mitchell created vivid, interesting characters who were fun to observe (with the exception of Scarlett, at times).4. People rant and rave over it being a racist novel, which is, in a sense, true. It is a book written about a racist group of people during a racist period of history in an area that was known to be very racist at the time. It was interesting to see how unapologetically racist people could be, according to Mitchell's storytelling at least. The book, though, is not racist in the sense that it supports racism and bigotry. In fact, I walked away from this book with a heightened interest in learning more about what freed slaves endured during the years following the war. For me, the mark of a good book is whether it encourages further study and intellectual curiosity, which Gone With the WInd can do.",
            "I purchased this book for a gift. The cover and the text were good, but the side of the book had a huge black marker line right down the bottom. I don't mind so much for myself, but I do not feel good about giving a gift that is marred. I was very unhappy.",
            "Using a kindle to read \"Gone with the Wind\" has been a real pleasure for my husband.He rarely reads books, prefers magazines, but the kindle is really working for him.As for the book, well its GWTW!!! As a southern gal married to a midwesterner its been hardgiving him a picture of how the Civil War affected us, and this has opened his eyes to the emotionalside of the happening.Good job KINDLE!!!!",
            "i just finished Gone With the Wind, and i love it. although it is heart-breaking, it's romantic and full of emotions. i like how the characters were develped; they all have their own traits. anyone who likes romance or has a lot of patience, i suggest you to read this book. (remember, you might cry like a baby when you finsih the book cuz it's........read it, and you'll know what i mean.)",
            "This book moved me because it was full of spontaneous adventure and valuable lessons. Margrett Mitchell not only wrote on romance and love, but also on the very real issues of a woman's place, jealousy, loyalty, and respect. Scarlett is the ideal stong and independent woman. She did not need men for their money and protection; she needed them for more suitable reasons like love and comfort. The entire novel was a lovely and inspiring story with twists of all kinds. I would highly recommend it to anyone in need of a wonderful read.",
            "Having lost count of how many times I have read Gone With the Wind, I continue to come back to it as, by far, my favorite book. Margaret Mitchell creates characters so vividly they seem real and sets them in a period of American history, the Civil War, that many of us are familiar with but from a perspective few can relate to, namely that of the Southern plantation family. It's very easy to create a vivid image of the characters, the context, the time in history, and how these factors mesh together to create situations that Scarlett O'hara can stuggle through and flourish in. Mitchell's creation of such characters as Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler allow you to question what exactly right and wrong really mean. These characters are selfish and crude, and reak of something, but throughout the book they continuously do extraordinary things for others. If you are in anyway a fan of historical novels, this is a must read.",
            "I thought the book was very good. I could not put it down. I absolutly hated the ending though. I wish I wouldn't of read the last.....150 pages. Oh well. I thought it was great anyway!!!",
            "I first read Gone With the Wind when I was fifteen . I read it again at twenty and have read it several times since. I am now forty years old and have read thousands of books and this book was and still is my all time favourite. there has never been a book so captivating , so romantic, so rebellious, so true to the south. Scarlett and Rhetts relationship is so full of fireworks it leaves the reader eagerly turning the page to see whats going to happen next. When I started a collection of all time classic books it was the first one I put on the bookshelf. I hope every young reader gets the chance to this fabulous novel.",
            "When Margret Mitchell wrote Gone With The Wind she probably never realized what an amazing story she began. The book combines romance with adventure. Scarlett O'Hara will always be remembered as one of the greatest characters of all time for her Irish ways and charming beauty.",
            "I read this book three years ago, but I couldn't help but write this review now. This book goes far beyond what humanly words can possibly say. This book sparked so many emotions in me, I thought I would die. Even at a few hundred pages left to experience, I was aching because it was coming to a close so fast. I can't count the number of times I cried, and how long I cried at the end. I didn't want to let go of the enchanting story, but I could never, ever read it again. This book truly touched me, and I'm saddened by the loss of this magnificent author. There'll never be another. God Bless You Miss Mitchell.",
            "Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind is my absolute favorite book. I enjoy books that have deeper meaning and make you think, but although this book lacks one it's a masterpiece all the same. Read it for the story and lose yourself in the Old South. P.S. The movie was great, but the book goes into much more detail and causes one to be much more drawn to the heroine.",
            "This awesome book takes the reader back to the 1800s and the Civil war era. Its main characters include Scarlett O'Hara Hamilton Kennedy Butler, from whose point of view the story is told, the charming and fickle Rhett Butler, Ashley Wilkes, the object of Scarlett's affection, and his wife, Melly. I say, if you read only one book in your life, this should be it!",
            "Margaret Mitchell's characters are very real and life like. Scarlett is never portrayed as perfect. Rather, the change from the young belle of Tara to the poverty-stricken lumber dealer and then to a lady sitting on a mountain of wealth shows her faults. The infamous Captain Rhett Butler always finds Scarlett. As her hatred for him increases, the more the reader sees the love between them that she is blind to. There is so much in the book that the movie doesn't include. I'm glad it is so long, for it brings longer enjoyment.",
            "This is undoubtably one of the greatest, most gripping stories ever written. At first it's hard to get into, but- once Scarlett makes up her mind there's no stopping her and the adventure starts. Charles and Melly Hamilton, Ashley Wilkes, Aunt Pittypat and most of all Rhett Butler send Scarlett flying into confusion. With the war raging all around her, trying to support her family and friends, and trying to understand Rhett, Scarlett lives through a time of hardships and scorn, and bears it stubbornly. This book was gripping to the end, and left me thinking &quot;What happens next? You have to tell me! I just have to know!&quot; I am definitely going to read the sequel to this. Anyone who likes thrilling advinture, romance, and fiery heroines will love this book.",
            "This book is for those people who can't stand when a good book to come to an end. Also for those who like romance and loved the movie. You don't have to have seen the movie though to enjoy the book.",
            "I can't help admiring! The greatest creation of gifted author. Characters are picted so vividly! Scarlett seems nothing but spoilt chiled, and Rhett is a real Man, real Gentlemen - one you can trust. They live though Civil War, they learn to love, understand and forgive each other. I've read this book about 20 times and now I am looking for any chance to read it in English. Don&quot;t you think now that it is worth reading?",
            "I have read this book twice and each time it's as if I'm reading it for the first time. I loved both the book and the movie. The story is very passionate and expresses the powers of love. Rhett is the kind of person any woman wouldn't mind being married to.",
            "My mother read this book when she was 13. I read it when I was 13. I don't have a daughter, but if I did, I'd surely present her with a copy of this when she reached &quot;the age&quot;. Has your daughter read it? Don't settle for just the movie (although that's wonderful, too)! Read it!",
            "Truly amazing. I have read and reread this book several times. It never fails to amaze me how brilliantly Scarlett O'Hara is portrayed. And how such a spoiled brat could become so endeared by millions, including me. A first-rate love story that follows birth, death, and the horrid destruction of war. Please read this book, and cry for a lost civilization - the south.",
            "As this quote from the opening of the movie says, &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is a novel which truly brings us back to a different time, a time of southern gentlemen and hoop-skirted women. But if you've only seen the movie, you've only seen half the story. The novel describes the life of Scarlett O'Hara, southern belle, in much greater detail, and paints a vivid portrait of life and love in the Old South, and of the Civil War which destroyed it. This is an inspiring tale -- Scarlett is a strong-willed woman who faces the horrors of war and survives, rebuilding her life from nothing. &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is a wonderful story masterfully written. It truly gives us an insight into, as the movie says, &quot;a dream remembered, a civilization Gone With the Wind&quot;.",
            "I love &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;. When I was 14 my mother handed me the book and said it was the best book she had ever read. I looked at the size of the book and thought there was no way I would ever get through it. One day I began reading and I just couldn't stop. I was sad when I had finished it and asked myself the same question everyone does; what happend next? I gave the book to my best friend. She thought I was stupid, but since she had nothing better to do she read it. She soon learned I really wasn't stupid.",
            "Margaret Mitchell's epic novel &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; defies all ratings. It deserves far more than a mere ten. I read this book when I was 13 years old, and discovered the most unforgettable story with the most vibrant, LIVING characters ever written. To me, Scarlett O'Hara, Rhett Butler, Melanie Wilkes, and all the others are truly real people. The movie &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; is undoubtedly the greatest film ever made, which it could hardly help being with such a story to work from. This book can and should be read by anyone who loves to read, because it is simply too good to miss.",
            "This book is possibly the greatest piece of literature I have ever set my eyes upon. Although it took me about two weeks to read it, I lived through a decade of history and watched as Scarlett O'Hara struggled against and won over every adversity in the midst of the Civil War. I felt as though I were right there watching as the drama played out before me. Never before have I had such a complete and accurate view of history and been fooled so completely into thinking that characters on the page were real people that actually lived. If one does not read this book, then it is a complete loss to him or her for they have passed up the chance to experience, rather than read, a book",
            "This has to be the best book ever written. You abosolutly will love this book. While Scarlette acts like one you would detest, you can't help but love her and all the other characters. If you've only seen the movie, you are in for a huge suprise. Lets just say Bonnie is not the only baby.",
            "This novel is a spactacular piece of work! At first the size of it scared me a bit, as it would most people my age, but boy am I glad I decided to read it! Scarlett is an amazing character, and the history is great. If you haven't read this classic, you are really missing out on something.",
            "Although I'm only 13, I have already read this compelling novel twice and am trying buy the book so I can read it even more! You feel like you are Scarlett's shadow, following all her movements and peeking into her mind and seeing her reasoning for her actions. My fave book!!",
            "This is a book that I believe everyone should absoluely read. From the first page to the very last you are entrolled into the deep south. The literate is beautiful as long as the glorious love story. I spent all my free time reading this book and was always thinking about Scarlet and what would happen next. This is the book that I would recommend to anyone, a lover of literature or not. When I finished the book and wiped the tears from my eyes, I was sad it was over. I wanted to go back and live in the time with Scarlet and never wanted it to end. Once is never enough with this masterpiece.",
            "This book was really good-it seemed to come alive as I read it. The main character is really amazing-not a friendly person-but she does stuff every one else was too nervous to do. Even though she grumbled all the way. Read it- but skip Alexandra Ripley's Scarlett. I'm sure she did her best, and GWTW is not an easy book to follow up, but it is nowhere NEAR this book.",
            "What can I say that hasn't already beign said? I think this is the most entertaining book of all time, not to mention historically accurate...I read it for the first time when I was 16 and in high school, and to my surprise, when we studied the Civil War a few months later in school, I already knew most of the battles, generals and dates! LOL :=)...this book is a gem.One more thing...though I think the movie is an absolute masterpiece and a must-see, I nevertheless think it doesn't do the book justice. It ommits too much. The movie doesn't show us Gerald's story and how he ran away from County Meath, Ireland straight into Georgia, Ellen's heartbreak when Phillippe Robillard was murdered and her resolve to run away frome her memories; but mainly, and what truly makes me sad...the movie doesn't develop the myriad other characters. What I mean is, it focuses on Scarlett, Rhett, Ashley and Melanie. However, the novel tells us of India and Honey Wilkes, Cade and Cathleen Calvert, Tony and Alex Fontaine, Sally and Dimity Munroe, the four Tarleton girls...you get to know so many stories...and since I truly loved all these characters, I missed them in the movie. Of course, there would have never beign enough time in a movie to cover all this...but, perhaps a miniseries could :=).P.S. By the way, in the novel, Brent and Stuart Tarleton were two very cool, masculine guys, as opposed to the dancing idiots we are shown in the beginning of the movie ;=) !",
            "This book is so overwellming we dont know how to tell you. even the begining of the book starts out wonderful, ful of detail, characteristics and a sense of humor. the plot is wonderful, and its not at all like an ordinary book. it shows emphuism and spirit as well as a sense of characters and people. this is a wonderful book and trust me if u think its to long, it isnt it actally is to short. u just have to start reading it, then youll get what i mean.",
            "This book is very attention grabbing it keeps you interested and is one of those books where you always &quot;just have to read one more chapter!&quot; Margret Mitchell is a true genius, and a very gifted writer. If you haven't seen the movie yet, I suggest you read the book first, you'll apretiate the movie more! The motion picture that was produced is the only one I know of that truly lived up to the book it was made after",
            "This book is one of the best ever written. It should be one of the books every family owns, right up there with Shakespeare. This beautifully crafted story takes you through 12 years of Scarlett O'Hara's life, and her heartbreaking romance. This book is impossible to put down once you start it.... everyone should read it. It's not tacky, or wishywashy... but real, and it touches the soul... trust me...read this book.",
            "Wow...Now this is a wonderful book. Gone With The Wind is something I know i should have read years ago! GWTW is so superbly a tale of the old south, and how it's changed by war. I was taken not only by it's vivacious and lively characters, but by it's wonderful forshadowing. And Rhett Butler, I just love to hate him!Gone With The Wind is a total must read!",
            "I am only 11 years old. Still, no one stopped me from reading the classic, Gone With the Wind. I encourage myself. When I started reading the book, I got so caught into Scarlett, Ashley WIlkes, Melanie, and Rhett Butler, that I felt as if I were living with them as well! When I got to the end of the book, I felt as if Margaret Mitchell had left out something very valuable, like she hadn't really meant to publish the un-finished book! I am getting very crazy about Gone With the Wind, and it's truly the first book that I can ever say sincerely that was my \"Favorite book\" ever! For anyone who thinks Gone With the Wind's words are too small, or that the book is too \"mushy and gushy for us,\" it's not! It's a nice, sad romance novel that I shall remember forever. Please read it. I am currently asking for the book, in hardcover original edition, for my birthday.",
            "Scarlett: you love her, you hate her. Rhett: the lovable rogue that every romance hero is measured against. An epic romance set in the antebellum era, &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; gives you a portrait of the timeless southern belle who has it all, loses it all, gets it back and - loses it again? Mitchell's fans will forever regret that she never got the chance to answer the question.",
            "This novel definitely stands the test of time, still as good as it was when I read it over 20 years ago. A great romance combined with great historical detail. Rhett Butler is still my favorite character, brilliant, sarcastic, flippant. So many people do not read this because of the movie, but the movie is a pale imitation. Please Read It! You won't regret it.",
            "I had not seen the movie before picking this up to read, so reading this book proved to be a real treat. I was immediately drawn into both Scarlett's and Rhett's characters. The way in which their lives wove in and out of each other's was beautifully told. Mitchell presented them as real multi-dimensional people, with both good and bad qualities. When I saw the movie after completing the book, I was completely disappointed with it. While the movie stayed fairly true to the book (not changing anything important), it DID omit several things that I think were crucial to understanding Scarlett in particular. (I won't ruin it for your readers.) I HIGHLY recommend this book, even if you've seen the movie. It has quickly replaced The Count of Monte Cristo as my new favorite book of all time.",
            "When I first started reading this book, I was like, &quot;ok, great, another borefest...&quot; but Gone With the Wind soon became one of my favorite books of all times! Scarlett and Rhett were some of the best characters I had ever encountered. A 5 star timeless classic!",
            "I just finished this book yesterday, and I can't stop thinking about it. Seriously an amazing story. The writing, the characters, the details, and the historical context were all perfect!I LOVED this book. Everyone should read it!",
            "I first read GWTW when I was a teenager and recently reread it after reading several books about strong women. The book is just as good as I remembered. Stories about brave women who keep moving forward have always inspired me. If you have never read GWTW, do yourself a favor and take the leap. Mitchell takes you right into the heart of a time that affected all Americans. Living in Atlanta where the book was set makes it even more appealing to me. After you finish this book, take a chance and read about other strong women that are alive and well, even as I write this. I was blown away by Mayada Al-Askari, in Mayada, Daughter of Iraq.",
            "I just loved this book! Filled with human drama, emotional conflict over basic values, and set against a war for civil justice. I saw the movie seven times! But the book was seven times better! I plan on reading it until the pages wear so thin that I can see right through them! Gone With the Wind beats any other book I've read including like my math book. This is the right way to study history! Signed: An enthusiastic 12 year old! ;-)",
            "I first read Gone With the Wind as a freshman in high school, and now 6 years later it's still one of my favorites. I have always loved the movie version, and the book is even better. Mitchell creates wonderful characters--you may not LIKE all of them, but they're amazing nonetheless.GWTW is just amazing southern lit...it may seem long, but trust me it flies by. If you like the movie then definitely read the book--you won't be disappointed.",
            "Over the summer, a friend and I made a deal that she would read To Kill A Mockingbird, one of my all-time favorite books, if I would get through Gone With the Wind. I agreed, although it was hardly a fair deal, seeing as how GWTW is over 1000 pages, and TKAMB is a mere 300...but it was the best thing I ever did. Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind is an incredible book--Scarlett O'Hara is the single most unforgettable heroine I have ever encountered--and though I often felt like strangling her for her selfishness, stupidity, and greed, I fell completely in love with her anyway. I came to know her so well by the end of the book that for awhile after I was finished, there was a bit of a hole in my life, and I missed reading about her as I would miss a friend on vacation. Fortunately, all I had to do was open the book back up, and I was again immersed in southern Civil War America. Scarlett, Rhett, Melanie, Ashley--each and every one became like a dear friend, I knew their thoughts, their feelings so well. There are not guarantees that everyone who picks up this amazing book will be able to finish it--but if you can, you are in for the time of your life.",
            "I am turning 13 now, and I first read this book when I was only 11 years old. It took me a while, but it was worth it. Gone With the Wind is the best book I have ever read so far! I loved it so much. It was very interesting, and I couldn't put it down. At some really exciting parts, I felt almost as if I were in it. This book was definitly the best book I have ever read and I recommend it to anybody.",
            "Gone with the wind was a story about a sothern girl who live in the southern part of the united states. The story tells how her life was before, during and after the civil war, She started as a bratty teenager who turn into a heartless woman,who hurt her sister and push a way a man who turly loved her. She let moeny take over her mind and soul. The stroy also goes on to tell how the civil war had on the south part of the united states.. this is a good book to read.",
            "one of the clasics and most loved books. my mom's favorite (and now mine!) she forced me to read it to improove my english and after a while i loved it! the story is sooo great, the characters are very interesting and are beautifuly descripted (as everything in this book- situations, etc.) if you liked the movie you'll love the book! Mitchell has done a great job! i can't describe the filling of reading it! it truly carries you away for a while! you think you're actualy there. it's a wonderful book!!!",
            "I loved this book! It was written in a descriptive language, but it was a level that everyone could understand. Maybe that's why people love the story. There is always one character (at least) that you can identify with. Just a warning, don't read it and expect to know all about the Civil War. It will talk about it, but it concentrats (spelling, sorry) more on Rhett and Scarlett than the war. Some say that it was racist. Slavery was wrong, there is no doubt about that, but there were always different kinds of masters. The masters in GWTW were obviously kind ones. This presents the way the South saw the war, which was very VERY hard on them. Read it and do yourself a favor. Just a suggestion, though, watch the movie first (which is also excellent) and then read the book so you won't be dissappointed with the differences.",
            "Yes, I would recommend this book to my friend because I think anyone who loves to read about history would love this book. And also anyone who loves to wear ball gowns would love to read about all the costumes Scarlett wears in this book. Over all anyone could love to read this book.",
            "I must admit, before I read the book, I watched the movie! And I liked it so much, I picked up the book and read it cover-to-cover in a matter of days! I absolutely could not put it down! Scarlett is my all-time favorite female charactor, and the whole setting is wonderful. If you have not read this book yet, what are you waiting for?",
            "I first read this book at 16 and it was the first (and about the only) book that would make me get butterflies in my stomach. Mitchell's language is very easy to read. Although some of the characters have what I consider character flaws, by in large the novel is quite entertaining.",
            "This is the best book ever written. Margeret Mitchell is the best author of all time and Gone With the Wind is both the best novel and movie of all time. I can't get much better than this description of the South. It never has a dull moment and the only ones who don't fully enjoy it is those who cannot understand it.",
            "The first time I read GWTW was in the 8th grade. At that time, I didn't comprehend a lot of what went on with the characters. A couple of months ago I read it a second time--14 years after the first time. What an amazing difference it was! I truly related to Scarlett and Rhett. They are the all-time couple. The only part I hated was Bonnie's death. I think that affected me more now that I have a child of my own and I could feel the grief that Rhett was feeling. I will most likely read it again. It made me laugh out loud, think and want to cry. A very emotional read!",
            "I'm fourteen years old, and I read both Gone With the Wind and its sequel, Scarlett. This book is truly amazing. It's a story about Scarlett O'Hara, the belle of Clayton County, who falls in love with a man already engaged. She marries another man for spite, and, when he dies, she marries yet another in order to financially support her family farm. All this while, Scarlett is still deeply in love with the man she can not have. Finally, as her friend Rhett, a blockade runner, realizes she is his dream, Scarlett finally finds where her love really should go...too late.",
            "This is one of the best books ever.",
            "This is one of those books where you find a little bit of yourself in each character, rather than finding one you can entirely associate with. It's imposible to completely like or completely hate any of the characters.There are many reasons I can't bring myself to read any of the liscenced or unofficial sequels to this book:1)This book was written about 73 years after the time setting of the book itself, & when the author was born in 1700, Having read books from that time, like Baum's Oz series, culture of the late 19tch century & early 20th century were more similar than the 1900s are from now, so she wouldn't have had to do nearly as much research on life in the Confederate South as a sequel writer would, & a sequal writer younger than herself would have their cultural views skewed by the changes of modern times.2)It doesn't really need a sequel. If you think about what direction the story might have gone in if Rhett didn't leave Scarlet; They were incapable of being happy together it might have had the same kind of tragic ending as Warren Adler's \"War of the Roses.\" Or since Scarlet is such a proud woman who has been married to many men she didn't love, she might return from Tara & decide to divorce Rhett upon his promised occasional returns & marry the childish Ashley just to kick Rhett in the side for abandoning her. Or she could have gone another 5 or 10 years persuing Rhett only to loose interest in him when she finally won him back; like she looses interest in anything else when the hunt is over.I recommend \"War of the Roses,\" as well as Jane Austin's \"Pride & Prejudice,\" as I find similarity in their rough relationship as well.",

            "\"Gone With the Wind\", taken as pure fiction, stands as an interesting and well-written tale of life in the Old South. Characters are well developed and constant in their portrayal of the complexities of love and life under the strain of a collapsing civilization. Survival amidst tremendous hardships and the source of strength in the human soul are topics that the novel/movie address nicely. However, taken in a context of reality, \"Gone With the Wind\" is insulting to the reader's/viewer's intelligence and to the ancestors of Southerners, both black and white, free and slave, through its completely one-sided depiction of life in the plantation south. Many other reviewers on this site have commented that \"Gone With the Wind\" is a nice change from other books and movies in that it portrays the master/slave relationship as being affable. The truth, however, is not so pleasant. It is evident from the reading of historical documents that even the kindest of slaveholders did not keep their slaves as well-clothed, well-fed, and lightly worked as the O'Haras kept theirs. Only once did the movie portray slaves doing field labor. It never showed the slaves' living quarters, which were often less than comfortable. The only brutality and punishment it showed was when Scarlet hit Prissy for not moving fast enough when Melanie was giving birth. The representation of Mammy is partly accurate in that she was a jack-of-all-trades woman who cared especially for the master's children. The other side of the \"Mammy\" role however, was that on most plantations, the mammy was overworked, on-call 24 hours a day, and abused sexually and physically by the master. Also, a mammy would have never had the authority to boss around a master's daughter like Mammy bossed around Scarlet. For those who desire a well-written piece of fiction that takes place in a beautiful and gentile fantasy world called the Old South, I would surely recommend \"Gone With the Wind\". For those who know better than to believe in illusions of peace and warmth in the plantation south and who enjoy books that have at least one foot in the doorway of reality, \"Gone With the Wind\" will not be on your list of favorites.",
            "Thinking of this book, it's hard to avoid a real feeling of sadness. Unfortunately, many people know NOTHING about post- Civil War Reconstruction besides what they read in GWTW and saw in the 1939 movie. Everything from both sources that relates to the Reconstruction era is wrong-- and yes, I do mean EVERYTHING. America reached a peak of racial harmony in those years that in many ways it has yet to reattain. It was an era of honest, integrated government, integrated education, integrated workplaces, and so much more. Many, many white people, including Southerners and former Confederates, were able to lay their racism aside to an astonishing degree and attempt to rebuild a new South. It was a shining, extraordinary period of our nation's history. Too bad few people know anything accurate about it, and instead get totally incorrect information from sources like GWTW!",
            "I loved that book and i couldn't put it down. It is one of the few books that just keep you occupied in your mind long after you finished it.",
            "I never read the book before, saw bits of the movie and have heard so much about it that I thought I should buy it and add it to my literary collection. It's thicker than other versions and the print is small, if that is no problem then go ahead and buy it. My version had a few weird quirks like accordian pages and uncut pages which caused it to protrude from the book and there were ink smudges as well.Content wise, I found the book to be well written and I enjoyed Margaret Mitchell's use of imagery. The words flowed, the book was interesting and of course you're going to love Rhett Butler. This isn't a true depiction of slavery and you shouldn't use it as insight into how life was like during the Civil War, although it might give you some idea and it's interesting to read from the Southerner's point of view. Obviously there will be some annoying aspects. I found it difficult to understand the slaves and skimmed through most of their dialogue and of course you might even get annoyed that the slaves were depicted as their most loyal pets that never question their masters and didn't want their freedom.But if you considered what time it was written and by whom, then it shouldn't dampen your enjoyment of your book. It's a book everyone should read. It really is good literature and worthy of the prize it won.",
            "Why would someone want to read a story about some spoiled rich girl? It is all in the art of the storytelling, and Mitchell is a master at the craft. It has been 16 years since I read this story and I can still remember the first sentence. As soon as I read it I was hooked. Although this is mainly a love story there is more to it than meets the eye. Mitchell takes us back in time into the very midst of the civil war. It is viewed from the perspective of Scarlett who cannot fully comprehend what is going on around her, yet the reader can feel an indescribable sense of loss through her story. During her trials, she perseveres and discovers a sense of strength within herself previously unknown. Great historical romance.",
            "I really can't describe how I feel about this book and about Scarlett. She is a character without parallel. You can't help admiring her even when you deplore her for her failings. Amazing.",

            "I was amazed at how interested I was in a classic - I have always thought and saw them to be pretty good books -although some modern ones definitly outshine them. But Gone With the Wind was a tearing, heartbreaking classic, the book so heartfelt. I could certainly relate to almost all things in the book. It truly showed a real look into humaity - something I think many people need to do these days.",
            "Gone With the Wind was a fantastic book. It's about this young woman, Scarlett O'Hara, who is living during the Civil War-in the south. Her rich and perfect life is ruined once the south loses the war and she is thrown into a time of starvation and misery. She becomes a widow and has to face those troubles as well.Mitchell created the character, Scarlett, wonderfully. She had spunk, determination, intelligence, and selfishness-traits that made her personality interesting. She does what ever she needs to get her by. Then there's Rhett. He's this dashing man who is no gentleman. I have to say, he brought a little bit of light into the dark parts of the book. He seems to be just a rude, mischevious man at first, but later on, Mitchell makes his character more full, shall I say. His character is deep and full of emotion and feelings-I really can't describe it.Then Margaret Mitchell created a bond and passion between these two characters. It was a wonderful romance, with love and anger-a sort of bittersweet romance. I felt I could connect with these characters.I loved this novel; I couldn't put it down. I read it at a young age, 11 to be exact, but I was into it none the less. It kept me hooked for 7 weeks until I finally finished it. It's long-really long-but absolutely worth it. I loved it, loved it, loved it! This book tied together historical fiction and romance, my favorite types of books, into one novel. It is a book not to be forgotten-ever.",

I bought this copy as a Christmas gift for a friend in Austria who is an avid reader and book collector. As a European, I felt his library was incomplete without the greatest American novel ever written, Gone With The Wind. The copy is authentic and even though fairly old, it was in great shape!

I do not feel it will remain in good condition for long and I am worried that the binding may work loose with reading and also will not store well on my shelf.

The ending was disappointing, sad, and flat. Who wants to be left hanging with a book this good? No one! I plan to read the sequel, Scarlett. I figure the story line can't get much worse than how it ended in Gone With the Wind. Read it once just for the experience. You probably won't want to read it again.",
            "Ugh -- By the end of this book, you're going to want to slap Scarlett silly. I'm angry that I wasted the past month of my life reading this book. Mitchell must have been getting paid by the word because she goes on and on and on about nothing. This book could have easily been 600 or 700 pages shorter. The romance between Rhett and Scarlett is not believable. A cold, drab book. Save yourself the agony: rent the movie.",

            "I have to admit one thing about this book. She got her Civil War facts right, which is more than we can say for some authors who have tried writing novels about the war. Other than that, I have nothing good to say about this book.Scarlett is one of the most annoying characters you'll ever read about. I realize she's supposed to be that way, but frankly I didn't care what happened to her or anybody else in this book. She got on my nerves right from the start.My biggest problem with the book was how racist it was. Critics of Mark Twain call his books racist, but Tom and Huck are probably accurate portrayals of kids growing up in that time and place (at least regarding their thoughts on slaves). To have Tom Sawyer make a comment that sounds racist to us is one thing, but in this case the author shows her own racism. A slave who came back south after visiting Boston with a Union officer complains about being expected to sit at the dinner table with the white people, who obviously didn't know that the black people were inferior and should eat in the kitchen. This was probably her view when she wrote it, but if you could go back in time I doubt if you'd have found any slaves who didn't want their freedom, or who didn't want to be treated as equals by the white people of the time.I've never understood the popularity of this book or the movie. If you want to read a good Civil War novel try something by Howard Bahr or \"The Killer Angels,\" or \"A Soldier's Book,\" or \"Enemy Women,\" or \"The Red Badge of Courage,\" or \"Shiloh.\"",
            "Along with D.W. Griffith's \"A Birth of a Nation,\" this nostalgic and wish-fulfilling \"riches-to-rags-and-back-to-riches-again\" romp across Civil War history is more than just the archetypical racist American novel. Together the two constitute a kind of sub-cultural \"power-duo,\" that captures perfectly the mindset that ushered-in a century of American Apartheid, and arguably that still governs much, if not most of American culture. \"Gone With the Wind\" is literally \"cotton candy\" for the Conservative/racist/Southern American mind.In the most syrupy and sophomoric of prose (perhaps ever written by an American author), Mitchell lays it on heavily. Scarlet, the archetypical southern bitch flaunts and wields her unearned entitlements with great immoral facility, demonstrating that even when down and out, \"being white\" still \"counts\" for more than anything else. Even when ravaged by the Northern Yankee soldiers, being a \"Southern white woman\" still demands royal treatment, and commands the regal stage always hovering well above and over all the lower animals, and especially, and most notably, over all the blacker ones.Let us admit it up front: Gone With the Wind is an important novel only because of its slightly transparent racist subtext, which still resonates with a large reservoir of American thought, habits, feelings and culture. And although the structure of racism, which the book appeals to, still remains pretty much intact and unperturbed, it is no longer respectable to acknowledge it, or most of all to speak of it in other than \"coded language.\"Griffith's movie, and Mitchell's book are perhaps the first \"coded\" version of racism that captured perfectly the American mindset, and thus are both valuable in this respect alone. It is in this sense only that Gone With the Wind is perhaps the best of this genre - eventually spawning the like's of John Jake's series on the North and South, etc.Meaning no disrespect, and noting that it won the Pulitzer Prize, being the best of this genre does not suggest that the book is being measured against a very high standard. But despite this and despite it's mean-spirited, amoral and wish fulfilling subtext, it is not easy to deny that this novel has earned its place in the pantheon of American history and literature. Since it remains such an important nostalgic representation of the racist American way of life, and is the best of its genre, it deserves at least four stars.",
            "Hell, I just wasted the better part of my Sunday reading the last couple of hundred pages of this trash, always in the hope that somewhere, there had to be this twist which would make the book worth reading, but it just never came. I ended flinging the book across the room, disgusted. Character, heroism, intelligence, thoughtfulness? Things Scarlett certainly lacks can all be found in books like Inception (Harbinson) or even better: A Town like Alice (Shute). Please don't waste your time as I did....",
            "My father browbeat me into reading \"Gone With The Wind\" when I was a teenager. To this day I can't understand what all the fuss was about. Scarlet is such a spoilt snit that I couldn't care what happened to her. I guess this is one book you either love or hate, so I recommend that you check a volume out of the library and read a chapter or two. If you hate it, you've lost nothing but a little of your time. If you love it, well, there's no accounting for taste.",
            "Written during the Great Depression when Americans needed escapism, GWTW and the resulting movie it spawned are primarily responsible for distorting many Americans impressions of slavery, as well as trivializing the horror of the Civil War. If you like your history covered with moonlight and magnolias and sugar-coated beyond all reality GWTW is just what you are looking for. After all, its only fiction. Problem is, too many people over the years have come to regard it as almost gospel. In the end, GWTW is little more than a cheap attempt to create an American version of Tolstoy's &quot;War &amp; Peace.&quot;",
            "I absolutely loved this book! I have to admit that when I first started reading the book, I had no idea what it was about. I read the beginning and was apauled to find out that I was reading a book about slave owners (I was a bit close-minded). After many assurances from family members that it was a very good book, I continued reading...and could not put it down.This book opened my mind to alot of possibilities. I really liked seeing the civil war from this perspective. Even though this is a fiction book, it did shed a different light on some of the events that took place in that time period. I enjoyed learning about some of the customs of this period and why they had them.Scarlett's constant battle with who she is and who she wants to be makes for some interesting situations. I found my own ideas of the characters changing with every page as new information was given of each one. Though I didn't like some of Scarlett's choices, I was able to understand why she made each one. You never know when something good or bad is going to happen in this book...it could be the next paragraph.This is a really long book, but it's worth every page. I think Margaret Mitchell did a great job writing it. It will definately be a book that I recommend to everyone I know.",
            "Let me make a simple statement: This novel is a perfect interpretation of the Antebellum bourgeousie South. Margaret Mitchell was born in the early 1900s and therefore the stories she heard, the ones that inspired this novel, were admittedly a bit skewed.HOWEVER, there is a lot of truth to Gone with the Wind, whether people like it or not, and beyond that, this novel is probably the perfect love story because it is so heartbreaking and so imperfectly human. Whether or not you agree with the portrayal of slavery, the Civil War, the Reconstruction, etc. that this novel presents, it is unfair to dismiss the greatness of Gone with the Wind. You can read all the Twain, Faulkner, Fitzgerald that you like, but until you have read this book, you do not have the full picture of American literature.",
            "Epic. Heart-rendering. Encouraging. I don't know where to start.If you have not read this book, I highly recommend it. If you have already read it, treat yourself to another read.\"Gone with the Wind\" is a book that I have read annually from the time I was a teenager. The characters keep calling me back. The story reaches out and grabs me. So, I go back every year for a visit with the characters who seem so real and present to me.What speaks to me the most is Scarlett, herself. Despite hardship, she provides for the people around her. She is determined. Scarlett is taught from childhood that who she is fundamentally is wrong and she should try to be someone else...and she does try for a while. (Does this seems familiar to any of us ladies today?) Only Rhett sees her for her true self and appreciates it. Despite being a renegade, he keeps his word, loves Scarlett and Bonnie (their daughter) honestly and deeply, while carelessly providing luxuries and lavishing them with attention. A real man!!!!! Mitchell's characters are complex, true, and touching.Also, Mitchell brings the battles of the American Civil War to life. The battles are explained in a style that is compelling and breath-taking.Scarlett and Rhett are people who are real and live life with passion and strength. If you want to meet Scarlett or flirt with Rhett, all you have to do is open the book and read as the past come to life.Happy reading!",
            "Gone with the Wind is one of the best books ever written, maybe the best.I can not even express how much I love this book.Many people disregard Gone With the Wind as a just a lenthy romance, but this is NOT what it is. Gone with the wind is SO much more than a romance. It is, for one, a book about the Civil War from the Southern people's perspective. This book gives the reader a brand new perspective on the Civil War and it is refreshingly NOT like all the other mundane Civil War books. It is full of history, but there is never a boring moment: Margret Mitchell is a brilliant writer whose beautiful and exciting descriptions, livily dialoge and none-stop story keep the book engrossing and never boring. I couldn't put it down!Again, Gone with the WInd is not just a romance, as I said, it is a refreshing Civil War book; but it is not only that. Gone with the wind has many suspensful, dangerous, and sometimes violent moments, such as The Burning of Atlanta or the event when Scarlett shoots a Yankee invader.The characters of GWTW are immortal. Each character is so beloved to so many readers, and there is a good reason why. Every character has his own fascinating personality. Every type of person, from selfish to greedy to tragic to stupid to controlling to timid to utterly kind is expressed in the book's countless engrossing characters.The story line is also wonderful. It is very complex but never confusing; it has such a good main plot and so many intriuging sub-plots.For the reasons I have attempted to state above and for so many more, Gone with the Wind is a beloved American Classic that has endured and will endure for many years to come.Whether are a man or woman, girl or boy, old or young, READ THIS BOOK!You will not regret it.And it just may be, that after you have entered the world of Gone with the Wind, you will find in it a new favorite that is worth reading over and over again.",
            "Margaret Mitchell was a genius. This book is so detailed and interesting it is hard to describe. Do not judge it by the movie. It is a very accurate portrayal of life before, during and after the War Between the States, in the South. Scarlett was not always an admirable character, but she was not boring.",
            "The love story is very well known and beautiful. If you want a great romance you won't be disappointed.However, the story behind the romance is what really made this book wonderful for me. It questioned what happens to people when society changes. What's great is that it shows many people's responses to the change. It reminded me of Chinua Achebe's THINGS FALL APART.The characterizations and descriptions are wonderful. I found this book to be very engaging and real. I would recommend it to anyone.",
            "Most will have seen the movie before ever considering reading this remarkable book. The \"bones\" of the movie are in the book, but the novel has so many more characters and details that it really makes for an excellent read. More background on Scarlett and the others and everything is much more fleshed out. Great.",
            "LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the book! What an amazing story line. It is entertaining, heart pounding at times, and very real. You can relate to the characters at times and hate them all at the same time. I think anyone will be happy to read this book and not feel like it was a waste of time. Happy Reading!!!",
            "This is one of my favorite books. Don't get me wrong, it has its faults - sometimes too-slow pacing, and deeply embedded racism to name a few. But we don't love things because they are perfect, or because of their morality. We love them because they touch us.As this book touched me.How can I explain the affecting emotion aroused in me by stubborn, foolish, sensible fiery Scarlett? Or the adoration of tough, roguish Rhett? Or the kinship I felt with the both of them? By that last, perhaps.This book is a historical romance, member of a genre known for its cliches. But it is no Harlequin. I have read enough of that genre, and am not a fan. This book is part of a genre known for crappiness, yet the romance between Rhett and Scarlett is real, not contrived, and feels real. Mitchell has accomplished what many have tried and failed to do, here: to write a strong romance novel that even readers of the non-sappy sort can enjoy.And the racism, that, too, has a purpose, though I doubt Mitchell intended it insomuch as it just was, because she herself was racist. A lot of historical novels (bad ones, at least) take characters from certain places and times, and make them into MODERN people, with MODERN values, misunderstood and inexplicably ahead of the times. Scarlett is a southern belle in the civil war south. This is the setting of the novel. Does she 'break the rules' at times? Yes. But she does not do it on every single count, and any messages thus conveyed are not overtly preachy. Mitchell has created something that is simultaneously believable, and yet transcendent, sometimes heroic, and larger-than life.",
            "I am only 11 years old. Still, no one stopped me from reading the classic, Gone With the Wind. I encourage myself. When I started reading the book, I got so caught into Scarlett, Ashley WIlkes, Melanie, and Rhett Butler, that I felt as if I were living with them as well! When I got to the end of the book, I felt as if Margaret Mitchell had left out something very valuable, like she hadn't really meant to publish the un-finished book! I am getting very crazy about Gone With the Wind, and it's truly the first book that I can ever say sincerely that was my \"Favorite book\" ever! For anyone who thinks Gone With the Wind's words are too small, or that the book is too \"mushy and gushy for us,\" it's not! It's a nice, sad romance novel that I shall remember forever. Please read it. I am currently asking for the book, in hardcover original edition, for my birthday.",
            "When I look back on my sophomore year of high school, I will remember it as the year I read Gone With the Wind, and became hooked. I have thought about it everyday since I started it. I adore this story. The descriptions in this book will take your breath away. Once when she was back at Tara, in the dead of winter, I looked up and was shocked that the sun was shining, and there was food downstairs in the refrigerator. It will literally sweep you in. I read it in September, in a little less than a week. I didn't read it as a challenge or anything. It was actually a &quot;rebelling&quot; act. My mom hates the story line because she doesn't like how Southerners &quot;won't let the war die.&quot; Her saying how much she hated it totally backfired because it only made me want to read it more so I could see what was so bad about it. Then I fell in love with it. When I re-read some of the dialogue, especially that at the end of the book, between Scarlett and Rhett, my heart positively aches. The language is so beautiful. I cried for an hour after I finished it. The ending is absolutely tragic, but there's no other way it could've ended and been as good. I don't understand how anyone can not like it. The Southern backdrop during the Civil War was a necessity to the essence of the story. I know slavery was one of America's greatest atrocities, but that's not what this book is about. It is the story of a woman trying to save herself and her home, and in the process, ruining the love of one of the most dashing, white knights of all fiction because of her only-human downfalls-greed, fear and lust.I loved Scarlett's character. She was exactly as Rhett described-a brave, frightened, insensitive, bull-headed child. She did try to be good, and then something would happen to scare her, so she'd get mean again. I loved Melanie, too. I want to be a friend like she was. She was good, but not goody-goody. She loved people fiercely, as Scarlett wanted things fiercely. She stood by her beloved friend to the bitter end, even though she knew Scarlett had betrayed her. Rhett was such an absolutely wonderful person. He only couldn't show it to the everyday Scarlett-hardened and greedy-because she would think him weak. He was only tender and loving when she was in fear. I want to meet someone like him-I just hope I don't act like Scarlett! The characters were so human, I loved them all. Everyone should read this book. It is such a beautifully-written masterpiece. It's my favorite.",
            "Being a guy this is kind of hard for me to admit, but this is the best book that I have ever read to date. I know that this is a \"chick book\" but I found it completely fascinating. I learned much more about the civil war from this book than I ever did from a history book or a classroom. I also learned about the origination of the KKK, all about slavery and all about real southern hospitality. There is so much more to this book than just a great story. You actually get to feel what it would have been like to grow up and live on a plantation before, during and after the civil war. I believe that this book should be read by everyone because of its historical value even though the story itself is fiction. I have read very few books where you really know and feel for the characters like you do in GONE WITH THE WIND.",
            "A fourteen year old who loves to read almost anything under the sun:I loved this book. When I was in seventh grade I checked it out of our little school library because it had a lot of points--we'd read books, take a test, and receive a certain number of points for that book. If we got everything correct, we got full points, and we needed many points to pass English every trimester.I didn't realize I was going to fall in love with the characters. Each person is beautifully made, intricate, and unique. You grow to know everyone in the story. Margaret Mitchell doesn't let any detail slide. She describes Scarlett beautifully.Scarlett is perhaps the most interesting character I've ever read. I hate her completely, and yet love her just the same. She was the most spoiled brat, and yet I felt like I was part of her, or she was part of me.Also, Margaret Mitchell does a good job of justifying the Confederate's reasons for breaking off from the United States. Although I don't agree with slavery at all, I could see where the southerners came off, believing as they did, and even felt a little angry at the northerners for being so hotheaded themselves.For those of you who have seen the movie and liked it, buy this book, its ten times better. And for those of you who disliked the movie, still get the book. It is very much different from the movie, you get in the whole world, and they left out so much in the movie. For instance, Scarlett ... well, just read it, it's good.",
            "While I admit to not being a fan of the romance genre, Mitchell's &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; towers above its imitators in style and substance. Set in the Atlanta area during the Civil War era, Mitchell's story exemplifies the proper writing of historical fiction, with painstaking accuracy of language, mannerisms, and morals. The war itself is also presented as it should be presented - in full color and with all its moral ambiguity, rather than the black-and-white presentation that so often is the norm in modern discourse.Mitchell's painting of southern culture and the all-encompassing war, however, serve only as the background for one of the most poignant love stories ever written. Following the life and loves of the willful Scarlett O'Hara, the work delves straight into the meaning and nature of love. Torn between her now-married childhood love, Ashley, and the outcast Rhett Butler, and in dogged pursuit of financial success after the devastating war, Scarlett lives a life of emotion and passion that few fictional characters have rivalled.Though this work is quite long, it is a very easy read. The style is light and brisk, the language uncomplicated except in the heavy dialect of the blacks, and the story compelling. &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; is a great book, a great movie, and perhaps the greatest love story ever told. Highly recommended.",
            "I began this novel in the 11th grade prepared to hate it to the core. Everything I knew about it made me expect a silly, eye-batting trip into a fairy tale world of the Old South with its impossibly virtuous ladies, its foppish gentleman and grinning content slaves, and I was actually looking forward to making fun of the characters, story and author.I could NOT have been more wrong about this novel. Margaret Mitchell, I salute you!This is to American letters what Les Miserables is to France, or War And Peace is to Russia. Nowhere else are characters like these to be found or is the human spirit portrayed as so unconquerable. I fell in love with this book. From its would-be detractor I became its most vocal champion. I was stunned over and over at how inutterably magnificent this contribution to literary greatness was. As one reads along about the lives of these larger than life men and women all set against the backdrop of the fall of an entire civilization, any sensitive person can only be compelled to acknowledge that there on the open page is a book that shall live in literary eternity.Of any work of fiction a person might feel compelled by \"duty\" to read at some point in a lifetime, Gone With The Wind deserves to be at the head of that list.",
            "This is a wonderful leatherette version, with a self ribbon place marker and a lovely gold dark gold and blue cover and heavy fine paper, with plenty of cloth fiber used in the making of the paper. This makes a better grade of paper only used in the best of books and stationary.They just don't make them like this any more!Chaska",
            "Gone with the Wind is a timeless, sweeping, epic masterpiece of American literature. It is the story of the South right before the Civil War, during the war, and the aftermath when Reconstruction began in the South. It is filled with drama, romance, tragedy, real characters with flaws, and I can see why this book won a Pulitzer Prize and why it continues to be a very popular book decades after it was first published in 1936.I don't need to go into a synopsis of the book, if anyone hasn't heard of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler, I'd be very surprised. If you have only seen the wonderful movie adaptation of the book, but have never read the book, I highly recommend you read the book. The movie doesn't capture the essence of the characters, the entirety of their personalities and motives behind certain actions and behaviors.I was captivated from the very first page. I can't describe exactly how or why, but Mitchell wrote in such a way that pulls you into the story. Her writing is simple and straightforward, and it touches you in a way that helps you relate to the characters and the world she wrote about. Her writing resonates with you, and keeps you reading. Her writing of the scenery and backdrop of the South, her depictions of the various characters, their motives, their thoughts, their innermost secrets that make them who they are. Mitchell brought this time period to life and causes you, the reader, to empathize with the characters and the struggles and upheaval they go through.Even though I know this story, how it unfolds and how it concludes, I couldn't turn the pages fast enough until I reached the very end. Scarlett O'Hara isn't the most sympathetic character you'll encounter, but as I gradually read her story, I found myself liking this character and rooting for her happily ever after, although you know she doesn't get that HEA in the end. I actually found the ending appropriate, it fits in with Scarlett's personality of a person who won't quit no matter what. She has seen the worst in life, and she remains stubborn in defeat that she can win back Rhett's love.Scarlett was a very selfish, manipulative, and cruel young woman, the only person she cared about was herself (with the exception of her mother, Ellen O'Hara, who she revered and respected and was the only woman she trusted). She was a simple person, not easily able to understand more serious and complex issues, which she usually shrugged off in a careless fashion as insignificant and unworthy of her time. She presented a facade of a lady of gentility to the world, all the while seething secretly inside at what she perceived as injustices against her or the unfairness of life if she didn't get her way. She was also willfully stubborn in her unrequited love for childhood friend, Ashley Wilkes, and it was quite sad to see her pine for a man who rejected her even though he did love her but was too cowardly to do anything about it.Despite her numerous character flaws, Scarlett had some admirable traits, such as her perseverance and flinty determination to survive. There were so many times where she was numb with weariness and feeling desolate at the heavy burden on her shoulders, but she would always put off her morose thoughts and say, \"I will think about it later\", and mentally force herself to take it one step at a time in order to stay sane and calm in a chaotic world. This was in contrast to her weak sisters who couldn't seem to comprehend that their old lifestyle had vanished forever and that a change was needed within themselves in order to survive. Scarlett, with her unladylike blunt honesty and very practical nature realizes this almost immediately. She was so unlike her tender and kind mother, Ellen, in almost every way except in one. Like her mother before her, she became the mistress of Tara, and in her newfound role she fills her mother's shoes in becoming what her family needed. Someone to look up to and lean upon for aid when needed.I found Scarlett a contradiction of sorts. She would look upon in contempt or disgust at those who depended on her, yet she would cast such thoughts aside in order to fulfill her duty to them as she couldn't abandon them. For her family because they *were* family and an O'Hara always helped family, and for Melanie, Ashley's wife, because of a promise. On the one hand she was a strong woman, strong in that she was able to survive the devastation of the South and show a courage of spirit in facing adversity and impossibility, but on the other hand, she was weak too. Weak in continuing in her girlhood, idealistic, puppy love for Ashley that blinded her to real, true lasting love with Rhett Butler who was her true soul mate. In some ways she was finally a woman, having the burden of responsibility of her family forcing her to mature, but in other ways, in her relationship with men, she was still a child. Of course, in the latter category she realizes too late what she knew instinctively all along, that Rhett Butler was the man for her and she had just been too immature, stubborn, and childish to see it clearly.Rhett Butler was the perfect match for fiery Scarlett. He was exactly like her, unscrupulous and looking to number one first (although, he did have his gentlemanly and kind moments beneath the veneer of mockery and sardonic amusement). Unlike Scarlett, he didn't pretend to be what he was not. He was no refined Southern gentleman and he took perverse pleasure in flaunting this in subtle ways. He is basically Scarlett in masculine form, only more intelligent.Some of my favorite moments of the book were the scenes with Rhett and Scarlett sparring with the other. It was amusing to see Rhett get the upper-hand over Scarlett every time. His witty quips most times went completely over her head, as she wasn't as clever as he, but that made it all the more amusing to see Scarlett finally meet her match in Rhett. I laughed aloud several times as I read Scarlett getting frustrated and upset stating he was no gentleman, only to see him laugh at her and agree with her he wasn't. Other scenes I enjoyed reading was the scenes back at Tara after she fled Atlanta, where you are witness to the transformation of Scarlett the Southern belle to Scarlett the survivor as she toiled in the cotton fields in Tara and tried to put food on the table for her family.I thought it was quite saddening to read about the delusions people in the South had regarding the war. The characters in Atlanta, such as Mrs. Merriweather or Dr. Meade, with their desperate, futile hope, and optimism that the South would prevail was sad to read about. Defiant to the end, in their naive and stubborn pride they thought the South and \"the Cause\" they fought for would triumph no matter the cost. It was this hope they clung to even as Atlanta was under siege by the Union army. None would know (or wanted to admit to knowing), except those perceptive enough to see the truth, such as Rhett Butler or Ashley Wilkes, that the way of life the South enjoyed up to the war was dead and gone. An old world that wouldn't come back, even if they had won, as it was forever changed, and like the title of the book gone with the wind. This book was poignantly sorrowful in that regard, you get a brief glimpse into the South portrayed pre-war and then post-war, and you realize it was never to be the same again.Although this story is told from the perspective of a Southern woman and her story of surviving the war, I think one could say her personal story reflects on a larger scale the entire South's struggles to survive in a new and changed world. The scenes of the ruined and abandoned plantations, with their eerie tomb stillness, was described in very convincing detail, and I found myself with Scarlett mourning the lost world she loved and grew up in.I could keep on writing about the various aspects of this story that were enjoyable and what I thought, but this review would get very lengthy if I did! Let me say this: the book was wonderful. Just read it! You won't regret it, yes, it is quite a hefty book but this story is so engrossing, compelling, and captivating you won't even notice how long the book is.",
            "This is my favorite book of all time. Maay critics of today have harsh criticism for this book, but a book is not always ment to meet current day social standards, it is supposed to take you away and entertain you. This is exactly what GWTW does and quite superbly I may add. If you are looking for an enchanting story if survival, adventure, romance, and whimsy, than do not hesitate to buy this book.",
            "When my mom brought this home, at first I thought I wouldn't understand it. I started the book because I had seen the motion picture and fell in love with all of the characters. Once I started I could NOT stop! I read in the shower, I read while I was brushing my teeth, I read late into the night when I was supposed to be sleeping. I am only eleven years old but I still hold Gone With the Wind a treasure to my heart. My favorite character was Melanie. I became Melanie for the couple of weeks that I read this book. I adored Ashley and admired Rhett Butler. I read with intent interest at Scarlett's luxurious life,I struggled through the Civil War. I felt the O'hara family's hunger too. Even though I am young,I say this book is up there with the best literature there is!",
            "This is the greatest romance ever written, and at over 1000 pages long, most people will finish it within days, reading it in bed, at the table, in the bathroom, in the car, on the way to the mailbox, just because you can't put it down, and every page is a page-turner. Fantastic dialogue, fantastic scenery, fantastic character development. You'll remember whole passages and be able to quote from it.",
            "Loved the book. If only Rhett and Scarlett could have been on the same page at the same time. I know they loved each other. Scarlett is so strong if only she could have stayed out of her own way.",
            "I have read this book a few times, seen the movie 32 times, so I LOVE this book. I learn something new about the civil war and the customs of the time every time I read this story. It is so beautifully written. This particular edition I purchased is a true gem. It is beautifully bound and truly a book I can pass down through the years. It was every bit as good as the seller said it was!",
            "If you're like me and Gone with then Wind has ranked as your favorite movie of all time, you won't be disappointed with this read. All 1,037 pages while worth the read. And I was pleasantly surprised how much more detail and different the book was than the movie. As awesome as the movie was, the book is even better! A must read for all true southerns!",
            "Most incredible read. I highly recommend it to all age groups. So beautifully written it was so though I was brought to scene of the story.",
            "Love the book and the movie. The books so are I am only about a quarter of the way through but it is great",
            "An American classic historical novel. Not only a great story, but also lets you feel the changes wrought in society by the U.S. Civil War in and near Atlanta.",
            "Margaret Mitchell clearly captured the heart and view of the Confederacy during and after the Civil War. Her vivid descriptions of people and places make it easy to visualize the story. Her attention to detail and accuracy make GWTW believable window into the lives of 1860s Georgia.Her style of writing is easy to read and lazily draws you back to the Antebellum South until you find yourself an intimate observer of a lifestyle based on an economy of slavery. Mitchell's book doesn't apologize or campaign for the institution, it just presents a picture of what was.I find I revisit Gone With the Wind every ten years or so, and each read brings a new light to a classic novel.",
            "I read this book every few years. The reason I bought kindle version was to always have it. This is a classical historical novel. I would recommend this to everyone.",
            "Forget fifty shades of gray! This is a true love story. A story with meaning and feeling. Gone with the wind will burrow deep in to your heart.",
            "I read it to make my grandmother happy, but from the first pages to the end I could not stop reading! Amazing book!",
            "This books is one of my all time favorites that I read over and over again. Over the years I have bought many copies and love to give this book as a gift for birthdays. It also makes a great hostess gift! The descriptions in this book are so amazingly colorful and wonderful that you see the fabric, feel Scarlett's corset, taste the food. You run the whole gamut of emotions. Every time I read it, I laugh, I cry, I rage at Scarlett and fall in love with Rhett Butler. This book has always been an education and I always find something new to marvel at every time I read it. Buy this book, buy two and give one to a friend!",
            "I love this classic book. In the movie, the cast does a great job of making them realistic.However, several decades removed from the reading, I find something happening each time I hear the music, or see pictures of Rhett Butler. Romance, yes. But also an immense sadness. A sadness that suggests the main characters could change nothing even if they wanted to do so, that they were predetermined to fail. I hope we have more control over our lives than they.A second sadness emerges; the unending optimism of Scarlett. It begs the question: Could her life have been different if at any point she had accepted the inevitable? Tara really could not change the inevitable, but could she?I love this incredibly sad story, and appreciate the history it relives for us all.",
            "Absolutely my favorite novel. It's a long one, but everyone should read it...men and women. Not only is is accurate historically, but it is also educational and interesting. The novel is far richer than the movie, and although the motion picture is a spectacle....the book puts the movie to shame. Read the book, and watch the movie again afterwards. The differences are astounding....but that is what keeps the novel interesting to modern readers. It's isn't the exact story we have seen on film on TCM again and again. Again, everyone should read this book. It has literary value, historic value, and pleasure value.",
            "GWTW-I discovered it on the shelf of my highschool library & having never heard of it, I decided I would read it. I was completely unprepared for the ride! While we all want to be Melanie, the truth is-we're all a little Scarlett on the inside! I have since read the book many times (and of course own the DVD) and never tire of it. A definite book for gals-you get a glimpse into southern life at the time of the Civil War and experience a love story of enormous preportions. &#34;Fiddle Dee Dee&#34; is our catch phrase around the house! LOVED IT&#62;",
            "Not only is this book very moving, but it is one of the most popular historicals ever. Albeit, I did think it was long and I sometimes got tired of reading about struggle after struggle and pain over and over, this is the kind of book that shows the strength of people. When you get done with this book, it will leave you satisfied.",
            "Gone With The Wind is a passionate,heartthrobbing,beautiful,romantic tale.I saw the movie when I was 4 but it didn't make much of an impression on me because when I began reading it in bookstores when I was 6 I was immediatley enthralled with the story of Scarlett O'Hara,the sweet Southern Belle that when the War made many hard changes in her life she became a woman that did what she felt like and didn't listen to other peoples disapproval.Margaret Mitchell has brought many hours of joy to me as I read from her wonderful book every day of my life.I love Scarlett very much as the main character but Melanie is more dear to me.She is a beautiful,shining,kind woman that always saw Scarlett's and Rhett's good.She goes to show what we have lost from that era.Many people hate Ashley and think he's a wimp but that's only his potrayal in the movie.In the book,he is like Rhett but takes diffrent paths in the same situations.All the characters in this book,the lovely description,and the era make this book\"my favorite book of all time\".",
            "This is one of the most fascinating book that I have ever read.In its sweep, it focuses not only on slavery but also on the impact of war (however justified or inevitable) in people's lives. Scarlett's character is brilliant. Her transformation from a butterfly to a tough woman who loves her land, her struggles against poverty and her determination to rise above it, her passionate nature are just some of the remarkable features of this book. Its almost as if in the character of Scarlett, the author has put in all the dreams, hopes and aspiration of America of the mid 1800's. The description of life in the south makes the book all the more enchanting. Above all, its a great romance- A wonderful summer read. Scarlett's character, could be the voice of many women across the world even today.",
            "It has been said that all fantasy books are &quot;Lord of the rings&quot; progenies. If true, then all romance books have &quot;Gone with the wind&quot; roots. Every hero worth fantasizing about has Rhett's dash and every heroine seems to have Scarlett's spunk.I first read this book after years of loving the romance genre. It was already some 5 decades written and the author was long gone but I remember thinking: &quot;Wow, so this was how it all started.&quot;",
            "If you read GWTW strictly as a love story,you're missing part of the picture,and I'm saying this as someone who DID read it as a love story many years ago at the age of twelve. And I don't mean just the surface historical picture either.It goes so much deeper.Scarlett is of course the central character,and to me,a metaphor for the \"New South\",in that she compromises with the new circumstances in order to survive.Melanie appeared to me as a symbol of the \"Old South\"-but the part of it that had integrity and strength.They needed each other in order to survive,and it took Scarlett until the end of the book to realise this.Ashley is the part of the Old South that couldn't adjust.Rhett is the person who though he despised the old ways and all they stood for until age and time made him begin to realise what he had thrown away.He still had a cynicism about it,but he also had an appreciation for the charm of a time that would never be again.As with many others,Scarlett was my favorite character in my first few readings,but I came to a new appreciation of Melanie over time. I began to see that she had a true quiet strength that Scarlett could never approach,one that didn't require her to compromise her principles and her loyalty,as Scarlett had to,in order to survive. The character of Ashley,on many further readings,doesn't appear quite as pathetic as before(though I never found him THAT pathetic in the first place).He was simply,as he tragically recognised,an anachronism in his time,a beautiful dream which evaporated under the harsh glare of a new reality.He was the part of the dream that Scarlett clung to,even as she clung to the ideal of her mother Ellen,never seeing the truth of these ideals-the honor,strength,and integrity of the dream,rather than the outward forms.This was HER tragedy-even though she was a survivor of a kind,she had to destroy all that was good in order to do so.Melanie had the true moral courage that allowed her to survive without destroying the good-to me,a much more difficult kind of survival.I'll need to read this book so many more times before I'll feel finally understand it all,if I ever will.I understand the old story,being born and raised in the South,of the struggle to hold on to your identity and still be a part of the world around you.I understand why The War can feel like yesterday-after all, most of it was fought on the soil here,and the losers always remember longer.I think the background of Scarlett's father,Gerald O'Hara from Ireland,neatly ties into this.Read and re-read this book,because everytime you do you'll find depths you didn't plumb before.There is so much symbolism to be explored,each reading will provoke new thoughts.",
            "Perhaps because it was made into a hit movie, this book is sometimes considered a &quot;romance novel&quot; instead of great literature. It is, in fact, one of the great American novels. Mitchell does not portray the antebellum South as an ideal but rather a doomed society, like the &quot;Tara&quot; of Irish myth. The characters are thoroughly developed and complex. A must read for anyone interested in the Civil War, women in fiction, and American literature.",
            "Review of Gone With the Wind By Chris WilliamsThe novel ''Gone With the Wind'', by Margaret Mitchell, is one of the stories that has stood the test of time and is still loved by many people. It is used as a building block for many modern love and war stories. This story is about war and about a woman's struggle to obtain the man she loves, or the one she thinks she loves. The main character, Scarlet O'hara has an inner conflict of who she loves, while a civil war goes on around her. It's a traggic story of how she marries men while thinking she loves another, Ashley Wilkes. The other main character, Rhett Butler, really does love Scarlet more than anyone else, but when Scarlet finally realizes that she loves Rhett, and not Ashley, it's too late and he leaves her. Both Rhett and Scarlet are very selvish throughout the story. Rhett's only concern is how much money he can make off of the war, and all Scarlett cares about is trying to win Ashley's heart away from his wife, Melanie Hamilton. This plot kept me reading and it kept me very intrigued, I kept wanting to see what else would happen to keep Scarlet from realizing she loved Rhett. Scarlet's struggle and the loss of her and Rhett's daughter Bonnie were key factors in keeping this story exciting. I think anyone should read this book, boys or girls could enjoy this classic novel about love and war. It is one of the best books I have ever read in my life.",
            "I LOVE this book! It is one of the only books I know of where the dialogue is so great that the dialogue in the movie was taken almost word-for-word from the book! And this definitely was the perfect role for Vivien Leigh, one of my favorite actresses.I just acquired a 1936 hardcover version of the book. I love old books and this will go terrifically with my collection. I feel like this copy could be the one Vivien Leigh read over and over before she got the role. She kept telling everyone she was going to get it, and they kept trying tons of other actresses for the role, finally giving it to Vivien Leigh!Gone With the Wind is an epic novel of great proportion, set in the dwindling Old South. A southern belle who doesn't believe in war or anything but her own affairs strives to control her passion for a married man while marrying three men for money. Her third marriage, to Rhett Butler, is complicated by their passionate, obsessive love for each other, which makes the book and the movie what they are. A classic, the book is also contemporary because many women today can find their own selves in the book. I feel an affinity for Scarlett. Hopefully, many other women are like the wonderfully kind Melanie Hamilton.",
            "The thing i just love about this book is the fact that the novel is literally identical, to the film and that is no mean feat, at times it can grate slightly, but the book is so astoundingly written that you overcome that, she mitchell has that incredible deepness that only people from the deep south have when telling a story and no one else has the ability to convey.It has every thing war, when war was romantic,a dashing rogue of a hero, and of course the herione and was there ever a herione like scarlett o hara.One of the most important times in americas history and all this played in front of the backdrop of the deep south.in one word astounding.",
            "Easily the best piece of American fiction I have ever read. It is not only one of the most touching love stories of all time &quot; Did it ever occur to you that I loved you as much as a man can love a woman ?&quot; is one of most beautiful things I have ever heard a man say to a woman - it is an amazing depiction of Civil War history, told from the southern perspective. And Rhett just spoils you - because you keep comparing every man you meet with him and they just don't come even close. Despite the fact that I'm a woman, when I read the book, I identified far more with Rhett as a heroic character then I did with Scarlett, because he is so unabashedly honest about why he does things, and he has courage to say and do things because he believes in them, even if the community he is a part of is too shortsighted or too willfully blind to see the truth of what he says. Scarlett is just a hardheaded egocentric little brat, and the only admirable part of her personality is her neverending grit and determination to survive against all odds during Reconstruction despite incurring the wrath of her society. But personally despite the fact that Rhett thinks they're right for each other, because they're both rebels, I personally think she's too stupid for him, she just never thinks about anything except what she wants and how she's going to get it. But I suppose going by the time in which the book was written women were expected to be stupider than men. Of course, in some parts of the world, including where I come from, it's still considered a good thing. Rhett is the best thing that happened to Scarlett, that's definete, though whether she's the best thing to happen to him is questionable. Maybe if he'd been able to stretch her mind and her heart a little while they were married I would think she was good enough for him. Aside from the personal story which has resoundingly real characters and the epic tale of the Old South, this book ( and the movie ) serves as stunning anti-war statement. It makes you realize how terribly futile and a waste of effort, resources, and most of all people, war can be. Anyone who misses this book has missed out on something wonderful. And as far as the end is concerned, it was really no more then she deserved after ignoring him for years and years, but of course you do want to know they eventually end up together, because you know that they will make each other happy.",
            "If you're a fan of the movie, you HAVE to read the book. It is packed with details the movie doesn't even touch. Plus I think the book is actually more entertaining, believe it or not. Reading the novel enables you to better understand the principal characters and the environment of the Old South. The movie, even though it is 3 1/2 hours long, is really a huge abridgement of the novel. So much is missing from the film. After you've read the book you'll understand what I mean. Finally, if you do read the novel, prepare yourself, because it is quite long and requires concentration to keep track of the vast amount of characters and scenes. Anyway, this is the best novel I've ever read, and I generally don't read novels.",
            "In the book Gone With the Wind, Margaret Mitchell accurately portrays both the struggles and triumphs of living in the Civil War-torn South. Through the characters of Scarlett, Rhett, Ashley and Melanie, she shares with us the many opposing viewpoints of the Civil War. Gone With the Wind is a book that is timeless due to its amazing ability to stun readers with its stark truth. Everyone can relate to at least one character: hot-headed, poverty-fearing Scarlett; her husband, the child-doting blackguard Rhett; gentle, sweet Melanie, whose love for the Cause is greater than anything; and and Ashley, the hater of all wars. For these reasons, I rate Gone With the Wind five brilliantly shining stars!",
            "&quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; is one of my favorite stories. As a writer and publisher I admire not just the craft of Margaret Mitchell but also that of her publisher. You do not find such excellence in editing and proofreading in today's books. This is one of those books so good, you find yourself turning again to the first page as soon as you've finished it!--Linda Donelson, author of &quot;Out of Isak Dinesen: Karen Blixen's untold story&quot;",
            "This was the best book I have ever read. I admit that it starts out slowly, but the rest of the book is well worth it. After reading the first chapter, I thought it was the most boring book in the world. But I kept on reading because of all of the wonderful things I have heard about Gone With The Wind. I was unable to put this novel down! I was engrossed in the story of the Old South. I highly recommend this book. It will be an experience you will never forget!",
            "Gone with the Wind, by Margaret Mitchell, is a stunning book which is sure to hold readers enthralled. Embark on an exciting journey, following the flirtatious Scarlett O'Hara, dashing blockade runner Rhett Butler, sweetness personified Melanie Hamilton, and the wistful Ashley Wilkes. Scarlett has always been a petulant, coquettish, southern belle. But too soon, the Civil War strikes, and Scarlett's perfect world shatters around her. Her beloved Ashley is married to Melly, a girl Scarlett feels is the perfect example of boredom. During the tragic, bloody years of the Civil War, the sardonic Rhett Butler enters Scarlett's life. This stunning book is not only a historical melodrama, but also a book that reflects the human heart and shows how Scarlett can change from a selfish person to a strong woman.",
            "This book is another world that I lose myself in while reading it. I get so involved with the story and plot that when Scarlett is dismal, I am dismal. When Scarlett is defiant, I am defiant. This book never fails to move me. While some people see it as a racist pledge to the Confederacy, I see it as the key to how the South felt about the war, about the Reconstruction, about life...",
            "This book is very good, and a page turner. Although many people say that the book is racist, and the author must be too, hardly anyone knows the truth about Margaret Mitchell. She started a program to help get African Americans into college, and that before her time, when there was still lots of prejudice going on. Yes it may sound like a sugar-coated world in GWTW, and it sort-of was back then, until the war hit. Also, you have to consider that the book is FICTION, while it is still historical fiction.",
            "I actually read this book. Hard to believe because I'm not used to being bombarded with great detail and historical happenings. Not into it really. But this book was hard to put down. It was slow reading because the detail had me visualizing so much that I had to re-read a lot of passages but when I finally got through it, it was well worth the journey. Highly recommended.",
            "I first read this book when I was in 8th grade. It was for a reading program. I don't remember how long it took me to read it, but I remember thinking it was the greatest book I ever read. I have often tried to convince my friends to read it, but because of its length, they refuse. Let me tell you, the story of Scarlett and Rhett is one of the best out there. It was beautifully written by Mitchell, her descriptions of the characters are extremely vivid as if you are right there in the book with them. I recommend this book for everyone, whether or not this is your type of book. Every page will draw you closer to it and the life it shows. But ever since I have read this book, I've read it at least 3 more times since then. And it always takes me by surprise and pulls me along with it.",
            "As an author with my first novel in its initial release, I am amazed at my recent rereading of GONE WITH THE WIND. I find it hard to believe (though I've known it forever) that GONE WITH THE WIND was Margaret Mitchell's first novel. She pulled it all together here with strong characters, a remarkable plot, and fabulous writing centered around the crucial event in American history. This novel, we all know the story, has become a foundation of American culture. It deserves to be. Read this novel, or read it again, if you haven't for awhile.",
            "When I read Margaret Mitchell's classic &quot;Gone With the Wind,&quot; I was in the eighth grade and as impressionable as a young teen can be. It was my favorite for a long time, and I can still pick it up and reread it without getting bored. A cousin really loves it too, or I thought she did till I learned she loves the movie and had never read the novel. Well! She's read it now, and discovered that not only did Scarlett have other children, she also has ways and feelings you'd never know from the film alone.One example is the maid in the O'Hara household named Mammy. Though she is indeed in the movie, she is a much rounder character in the novel. On her deathbed, Scarlett stays by her side unselfishly, nursing her to the end. Other slave characters are more prominent in the novel also, such as some that move and marry. Vivian Leigh did justice to her role, as did all the others, but still, all pale in comparison to the depths they possess in the book.Screenplays are so different to read than novels that they don't seem to compare either. Sometimes a novel reads so visually that you believe the author had a film version in mind when writing it. One that struck me as such recently was &quot;The Horse Whisperer.&quot;The opening scenes with the girls on horseback, the slow-motion effect of the wreck, all of it, was like watching a movie instead of reading a book. The ability to write this way may be a great talent that most don't possess.What are you thoughts on novels to film? I'd like to know. And, if you've never read your &quot;Gone With the Wind,&quot; try it today and see what you missed in that favorite of yours.",
            "I love books, and I love history. It seems that this book was a godsend for me! Wars have never interested me, the civil war, of course seemed like a no brainer: Yankees=good, Confederates=bad. But this book has made me realize that both sides suffered. It wasn't a no-brainer...it was difficult for everyone. Girls and boys, Women, Men, everyone! So many people suffered, and were hurt. This book is a wonderful mix of adventure, romance and history, weaved together to make one of the best books of all time.",
            "I first read this book, 2 years ago, in 6th grade and loved it. This is one of the best books I'v read, along with Little Women. I love reading books about the past. The caracters were very different from most books. They wern't perfect. I also loved how Scarlett could get any man she wanted ,and did, with the exception of Rhett. It had every thing a good book should have.",
            "I have never had the concentration to sit through the movie all in one go - but I found the book, all 1000+ pages of it, compelling. Other reviewers have commented on the amount of detail put into this book, which makes it all the more real. And we are forced to sympathise and feel for characters that behave in what those of us living in the year 2000 would regard as most sexist and racist behaviour. It really gives you some understanding of how people lived and regarded each other at that time, and the different class and race structures which existed, with interesting insights into the interactions between the people who owned plantations and the slaves who worked on them. And of course, we have the character of Scarlett to contend with - one of the most spoiled and most motivated heroines ever described. I wished so much for her to open her eyes and see what a waste of time Ashley was, and how much Rhett loved her, but she is too immature to realise all this. I am debating whether I should read 'Scarlett', the recently written sequel, or just imagine her living her life out with Suellen and Will, her children and her money. A sign of a great book is the way it stays with you long after you've read it, and I often find myself rethinking passages from this book. I would recommend it for anyone.",
            "I'm a 12 year old and a little while ago finished reading GWTW. It was my favorite movie for the longest time and I decided I wanted to read the book. All my friends bet I would never finish it but I did! It may be long but there was never a dull moment. Read this book or see the movie! Actually, do both!",
            "i am completely in love with the book Gone with the Wind! Mitchell does an amazing job at using such descriptiveness as to put you right there in the story. It kept me up for nights on end as i couldn't get enough of it. This book is full of amazing characters that you grow to love and to hate. My personal favorite, Rhett Butler, made my heart skip a beat every time his name was mentioned. It is an excellent civil war romance that i could read over and over again!",
            "Wonderful story!! Margaret Mitchell did an amazing job in her research to make this book as accurate as possible. This is one of my favoritr books!",
            "As it always has, GWTW sweeps you up in its story about a woman who faces down adversity and never blinks. Scarlett may have flaws, but when trouble comes, she's the one everyone turns to for answers, and she's the one who has solutions. For many women, especially myself,it's still the most compelling American novel of all time.",
            "I had already read this book, I just reread it because i needed to add it to my kindle. Remains to this day my favorite book!",
            "Absolutely beautiful antique book. Crisp pages, tight binding, and that \"old musty book\" smell well all love. Couldn't be more happy with the service and speed of delivery. Love it!",
            "I remember going to the old Orpheum Theater with my mother and my best friend to see \"Gone With the Wind\" 'in the summer of 1969. I was so excited to see my first grown up film. I can see the maroon curtains unveiling the movie screen as the lights dimmed. Not a sound could be heard, but the opening strains of music and there was Tara! I was smitten. Laura and I sat through the second showing too. Exhausted, but roiled up was I when I got home. On my lonely supper plate laid my very first copy of Margaret Mitchell's GONE WITH THE WIND! Needless to say, I wolfed down supper and went to my room and began reading the book that I've had a love affair with since that summer day.With each reading I notice something I've missed in prior readings. I still find Slavery to be the abomination as it has always been. And it must have been harder to read about a mere 75 years after the end of the Civil War in 1936 when GONE WITH THE WIND was first published. I'm not surprised that this epic historical novel won the Pulitzer Prize in 1937. Mitchell has created a multitude cast of characters, giving each their own distinct voice. The reader can tell the difference between Pork, Mammy, Prissy, and Uncle Peter and that is credit to Mitchell. But even minor characters sound different. Tara, Twelve Oaks, and Atlanta also become fascinating characters too. As Tara represents the ability to change as the new South rises in defeat of its old genteel feudal life style where every man, women, and child are free to live as they want. Twelve Oaks reflects the Old South that is forever torn asunder. It is Ashley's South. He doesn't fit in with the change. He and Melanie are perfect for each other. She understands him and the dream that was the Old South.Rhett Butler hates that Old South because it tossed him out and turned its back on him. His bitterness fuels his pleasure as he sees its demise as Atlanta burns and his pockets are full of Gold. He is the most transformed character in GONE WITH THE WIND. I'd never observed his transformation as I did in this reading. No wonder the 35 year old fell for the fiery self willed 16 year old Scarlett O'Hara. Not only is she spirited, she possess a dogged determination of those who seem to get their way most of the time. It is Scarlett whom Aunt Pitty and Melanie feel safe in the absence of a man in their Atlanta household. It is Scarlett who makes sure her kith and kin are safe, housed, and fed. She tells us that she'll never be hungry again no matter if she has to cheat, steal, or commit murder. So it's no surprise that she marries for convenience after she had married to make Ashley miserable and silence wagging tongues at Twelve Oaks. I felt sorry for her boys; she really was a mother only to her precious Bonnie. And how on Earth could she have loved a wuss like Ashley Wilkes when she had a grown man who loved her? I'd like to think that Scarlett O'Hara Hamilton Kennedy Butler got her man back after she returns to Tara. The land always gives her strength and regenerates her spirits. But I wonder if she realized too late that she loved Rhett and really belonged with him? Well after all, tomorrow is another day.",
            "I bought it for my kindle, because its summer and there will probably never be a better beach read or a better book ever anyway. Scarlett still steals your breath with her personality and Rhett still makes you swoon and this is still the best book I ever read.",
            "When I began this book, I began something that I didn't know how to end. I began a journey, and as this journey came to a close, I nearly came unravelled at the seams. I'm serious. This book is ruining my life a little bit right now, and I'm just not sure what my refractory period is after finishing a truly, devastatingly good novel that also breaks my heart.I will say this as a foreward to a very long and very emotional review- this book is quite problematic for me and I'm sure for many others as well. I am a girl born and raised in the North and there are some things, even fictional things, that I am uncomfortable with. That's just who I am. I absolutely applaud Mitchell on this masterpiece, but I also raise an eyebrow at her. There are offensive things in this book, mind you, and it takes awhile to get past them.We all know the basics of this 1,000 page Bildungsroman. Scarlett O'Hara, sixteen years old, the charming Southern Belle on her plantation Tara, blissfully ignorant and delightfully simple, devoted to her one true love, Ashley Wilkes, while courting several other \"beaux\" and enjoying her sweet life. Then the war comes, and then Ashley marries, then Rhett Butler appears, and suddenly, the novel begins, and I was swept away by its tide so fast I didn't know what hit me.My first reaction to Scarlett was overwhelmingly negative, which I'm sure is the common reaction. She is just so overwhelmingly simple. She cannot grasp scarcasm or irony or metaphor, she hates books, and she detests any talk of politics. And she prefers the chaste and simpering affection of men to any kind of female companionship, save for the love of her precious and doting mother Ellen. And for some unfathomable reason, she is absolutely devoted to Ashley Wilkes, a sappy pretty boy who is already engaged to be married. Scarlett is the protagonist I usually shut the book for. I don't identify with her, nor did I originally want to. She was cute, sure, and I was swept away by her first dance with Rhett, but I still didn't like her. Then, about 200 pages in, she becomes a heroine.I will always consider Scarlett O'Hara one of the bravest women I've ever read. She is strong, she is willful, and she does what needs to be done, no matter how unsuited she is for the job. When she had to help Melanie Wilkes give birth, sweet little Melanie whom Scarlett hated with fire, amidst burning Atlanta, I was on the edge of my seat. When she was abandoned by Rhett and had to fend for herself, Melanie, the baby, and her child, she just fought, and she survived. And I felt like there was hope for the rest of the story.Not only was Scarlett a heroine, she was a clever one. She married her second husband for money and used that money to make more money for herself, while presenting herself in \"unladylike\" ways, such as -gasp- leaving the house while pregnant! Quelle horreur! I loved this part because it wasn't just cheesy romance or adventure, it was relevant and interesting and very smart. Scarlett was blossoming, maybe not to others as much as she as to me. She was beginning to grow so multi-faceted. Now I have this strong, brave, brilliant woman, and what does she do? She breaks my little heart. All because of Rhett Butler.Rhett Butler was a conflicting character for me. To most women, he's a god. He's manly, rough, and a little dirty, but he also tries to know what women want and he loves hard and deep. But he's kind of a jerk and I go back and forth between loving and hating him. He doesn't take Scarlett seriously and he seems to think too highly of her reasoning skills, and I don't think those two ever really knew each other at all. Not to mention the fact that he probably raped her. He does redeem himself at the end, at least he mostly does, and then my heart ached so bad and I wanted things to be different so badly. I felt like I was the one who'd lost my chance. I was the one who didn't get my love, not Scarlett or Rhett. I hurt for them, for the evils they saw, for the harshness they lived, for the children and friends and family they lost. I was brought close to them and then I was torn apart. Mitchell made me love what could have been, and then when it wasn't, it was a loss that I am still recovering from.There are so many characters you fall in love with in this novel. Scarlett is probably one of the most multi-faceted characters I've ever read, and I think I love her. She is cold, powerful, manipulative, spiteful, delusional, childish, and shameless, but she is also hardworking, stubborn, idealistic, charming, hopeful, sensical, practical, and intensely brave. She grows in some ways and stays the same in others. She knows how to get what she wants and she knows how to stand up for herself, but when she learns a lesson, she learns it too late, and I just want to shake her. She is infuriating, but she is also infuriatingly real, and I will never forget her.Melanie is another character I will never forget. Her sheer devotion and faith and loyalty to Scarlett is achingly bittersweet, since she is used like Scarlett's puppet, but the scene of her death killed me. That is the only time Scarlett states her outward affection for Melanie and it was perfect. The bond they had was really interesting. I loved Will Benteen and Aunt Pitty and little Bonnie Butler.Now let me discuss why I am hesitant to discuss this novel with everyone. \"Gone With the Wind\" is unfathomably racist. I don't care if it was set in a time period. I don't care if it was the environment or the social commentary or even if Margaret Mitchell was racist or not, the language and characterization of the black slaves in Georgia is REALLY offensive. Like Alice Walker has said, white people use the altered way of writing a black person's speech to highlight that they truly know better and that it only makes the black characters look silly and uneducated. In novels with British characters, we don't use different spellings or exaggerated syntax. I HATE when white writers do that. It is embarrassing. I don't like it when people say that this novel was telling the story of the \"real south\", because it doesn't matter if it is real or not, it doesn't need to be glamorized. I'm glad Mammy is such a devoted person. I'm glad Pork is so proud of himself. But I hate that it is somehow attached to their status as slaves.Also, I'm pretty sure Rhett raped Scarlett. She ended up melting into him and enjoying his attention, but he would've done it whether she melted or not. I know that and I think Mitchell knew that. It makes it hard to love Rhett, but then again, there isn't an unconflicted character in this novel.Is this book problematic? Oh, yes. I completely understand the criticism and I won't hesitate to criticize it myself. But sometimes, problematic literature is also beautiful, and well-written, and emotional, and touching. This is one of those books. I will never forget this story. I am changed by it. I was reading it last night and when I read the part after Scarlett fell down the stairs and she calls for Melly but Melly can't come because Rhett is crying in her lap, I started crying. I really was crying because it was too much, and this is what the book does to your life when you set out on the journey to read it. Take the journey but pack a lot of provisions, and keep your mind open but sharpened, and let yourself enjoy it while still taking the time to think and reflect.Now, because I just have to- The girl I was before I read \"Gone With the Wind\" is truly gone with the wind.",
            "I read Gone with the Wind many years ago, so it was a pleasure to read it again. I only gave it 4 stars because I almost always wanted to have a \"talk\" with Scarlett. I am so glad she \"grew up\" finally at the end... a little too late, but better late than never. I loved the history that Mitchell sprinkles through the book. I also enjoyed seeing how some things never change. Such a pleasure to read.",
            "I have had this book in my library for well over 10 years. I often picked it up, but never began to read it. I knew of all the hype about this being the great American epic novel and a Pulitzer Prize winner. I had seen the movie twice. The first time when I was maybe 8 when I saw it with my grandparents. The only thing I remember was asking my grandfather, \"Why is grandma crying?\" The second time I saw it, maybe five years ago, I was deeply disappointed in its lack of realism. Today's movies of blood and gore made the battle scenes and the long bloodless dolly shot of the wounded soldiers lying on the ground in Atlanta look plastic and fake. Another reason I neglected to read this book: 1024 pages. But, finally I decided to give it a shot, and am I glad I did. It is difficult to find the proper superlatives to use here. One plus, because of my busy schedule I had to read this in fits and starts, and it took over two months. However, author Mitchell has given us such strong and descriptive characters and has given so much detail to all of the plot twists and turns, that it was easy to return to the book and have complete remembrances of what has happened in the preceding pages. The story is compelling. Scarlett is a complex and fascinating heroine; Rhett her perfect antagonist. The minor characters all are well drawn. From the battle scenes, the aftermath, the period of reconstruction, what we have here is history come alive. I will cherish the hours I spent with this book. As a result, I will now search for a biography of Ms. Mitchell to learn why this was the only book this magnificent author ever wrote.",
            "I haven't been so engrossed in a book in a while. That's not to say I haven't read any good books lately, but there are some novels that take you hostage, laying siege to your thoughts until you can't think of anything else. You turn every single page, devouring them one by one. When it's over, you've ingested it and the story sticks inside you. It becomes so much a part of you that it's like looking through an old lens at something that happened to you a long time ago.Scarlett O'Hara has been forever ingrained in my brain as someone to aspire never to be like and someone to admire. She is completely oblivious to people and how they work-hurting feelings and breaking hearts-but she has gumption and ambition, which is admirable. Margaret Mitchell masterfully crafts a protagonist that is a completely different person on page 1,448 than she was on page 1, but still fundamentally the same. It's a brilliant blend of changing times and societies, a history lesson, a love story, a tragedy, and most of all a story of a person's capacity for change. I actually feel like there is nothing more I can say about this novel to do it justice.So, I suggest to anyone and everyone to read this book and not to be intimidated by the page count. It is honestly one of the best stories I've ever read; there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that this is rightly deemed a classic novel.",
            "I wasn't quite sure whether I would enjoy Gone With the Wind. It's a large, forbidding book. But I loved it. Most of you are probably familiar with the basic story: the main character is Scarlett O'Hara, a spoiled southern belle in the time of the Civil War, and her desire to get everything she wants, through any means possible. A huge book, there are many characters in Gone With the Wind. Scarlett manipulates many men, but the ones she really cares about (Ashley, and later, Rhett), she can't. When she gets something she wants, she doesn't want it anymore. Scarlett is always frustrated, and is always making plans for the future. In some ways, this wasn't what interested me most about the book. I loved the setting. I just read A Soldier's Secret (admittedly, in a whole different class of literature), but anyway, that was from the Union perspective of things. In Gone With the Wind, none of the Southern ladies think that there's going to be a war. And when war does break out, they think that they're going to \"lick\" the Yankees in one battle. But the \"Yankees\" thought the same thing: that the Confederacy would be beaten immediately. Instead, we have a long, drawn-out, brutal, four year conflict.The Southern culture described in the book was interesting too. Among rich Georgia plantation-owners, there is a code of conduct, a certain way of behaving. The ladies can't say what they really think, a widow must wear black mourning clothes for years and never have any fun (Scarlett is in this predicament when she's only seventeen), etc. etc. Rhett Butler challenges all these things. He openly admits that he'd work for the North if he got paid more, he doesn't believe that the South will win, and he mocks the patriotic \"brave\" men of Georgia who fight. But at other times, he can be really cruel to Ashley. It was interesting to see how different life was among wealthy people back then.As for the characters, Scarlett is spoiled and used to getting her way, and she's from a slave-owning family, and yet...sometimes you sympathize with her. She genuinely cares about Ashley, she does have feelings, even though she's not very intelligent (though good at flirting with men.) Most of the deeper ideas expressed by some of the other characters go right over her head, and I was really frustrated by that. But my favorite character was probably Rhett. He's not afraid to challenge the system and say what he thinks, and he always seems to pop in the most convenient situations (for him, at least.) Rhett, when he meets Scarlett, makes her begin to challenge the way of life a bit. When he meets her, she's in mourning for a husband she was married to for two months and who she didn't care about. Only seventeen, she is desperate to be able to go to parties again, and he helps her do that. But he's complicated too. Underneath that mask, he's not as smooth. I think the white characters in the book were very well portrayed. Melanie, the wife of Ashley, is also a very sweet and kind woman, though she always misconstrues what Scarlett is thinking. Melanie always believes the best of people (which perhaps is not always wise), but that makes her a lovable character.However, you have to remember that the book was written in the 1920s and 30s, and set in the 1860s. There are plenty of stereotypes about blacks, and some derogatory words for blacks (darkies, the n-word). I find it very hard to believe that some of the slaves turned servants never wanted freedom, independence, or money. You just have to be aware that Mitchell is obviously very biased, and not believe everything she tells you.Gone With the Wind is a timeless classic and I would definitely recommend it to everyone. You can read Becky's excellent review of it here. Gone With the Wind does take some commitment as it is almost 1000 pages long, but it's a rewarding read.You can read all of my reviews at my blog, novareviews.blogspot.com.",
            "Perhaps you've heard of Gone With the Wind. In movie form, this work is quite stunning and fun. In print, it's breathtaking and provides bone-jarring visuals as well as a rich and well-developed story not often encountered.Mitchell's portrait of pre-during-and post Civil War South gives depth and intelligence to the people of the land, while simultaneously giving voice to their faults and well-intentioned geniality of that day and age.Characters like Scarlett, Rhett and Melanie gain personality that the movie does no justice. Although you know Melanie is going to die, when it finally hits, there's a true sadness that this rich personality we've traveled with is now leaving us. And in the end, Rhett still does leave Scarlett, but it's about more than not \"giving a damn\" and we feel sorry more for Rhett in this scene than for Scarlett (although we are glad that she finally gets it!)The characters almost disappoint as well, as they do everything we wish they wouldn't and do not behave as we want our characters to, thwarting their happy ending every step of the way. But Scarlett's real and honest love for Tara surrounds the novel and holds every element of the story together.In the end, there's only sadness upon finishing this novel in that there will never be a sequel by the late Margaret Mitchell, and perhaps even if there were there'd be no duplicating the magic that she created in this true and poignant work.",
            "I bought an original book 1936. I am just a little more then half way through the book. I'm so glad I didn't live back then. I wouldn't have been near the woman Miss Scarlet was. But when I was growing up I didn't appreciate history. That's why I wanted to read Gone With the Wind. Great history lesson. Sad but that was then",
            "Simply this. GWTW is one of the best books I have ever read. Never thought that would be the case, as I assumed it was just a book about romance and that's not mt preferred genre. But here is the unfortunate truth: while I was completely captivated with the book, I loathe the way it ends. It is like the author just got tired of writing it and decided to wrap things up quick with a few bittersweet insights. So, 99.9% of the book is five stars, the rest, being the very end, gets zero stars.",
            "Gone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell is a timeless classic. It is a wonderful tale that keeps you truly enchanted by the life of Scarlett O'Hara. Gone With the Wind takes place before, during, and after the Civil War in Georgia. It starts out at the beloved Tara, but soon finds itself in Atlanta. When Scarlett speaks of everything going on you can't help but feel the emotion she feels.At the beginning of the story, Scarlett wants Ashley as her husband. However, Ashley is to be married to Melanie, his musical and intelligently inclined cousin. Scarlett ends up marrying Melanie's brother, Charles, even though she still loves Ashley. He soon dies in the war and leaves her with a baby boy. After the war, Scarlett marries her sister's fianc&eacute;e to keep the Yankees from getting Tara. He later dies in a Ku Klux Klan raid and leaves Scarlett with a baby girl. A year later, Scarlett marries Rhett Butler and has a baby girl with him. Soon Rhett leaves Scarlett forever because she still loves Ashley and she needs to sort out her life.",
            "I love the movie so much that I just had to read the book. Now after reading the book I feel like the movie does not follow the book as well or as much as I thought it should. I think the book was a beautiful very complex story and I appreciate the language that is used. The time that the quthor used to explain the thoughts of the characters truly showed her love for each one.I enjoyed the highs and the lows of each character and there was no one that I loved or hated through out the book (except ashley) :). In a time where Twilight and Harry Potter are all that people want to talk about I once again appreciated the journey I took reading this book.#TeamRhett",
            "GWTW remains the classical view southerner's have always thought life was before the \"War of Northern Aggression\", as so many call the Civil War. While life in the \"big house\" was opulent for some, it was bought and paid for by the inhumane life of countless slaves. As a southerner who family never owned slaves - we were too poor!, I enjoy the fantasy that is GWTW, but always have a sickening feeling in the pit of my stomach knowing that the life Scarlett lived was nothing like the life of the average farmer's daughter. Just as the \"robber barons\" of the north enjoyed oppulent living from New York to Newport, society can not afford all for some and nothing for the many. By the way, the book is still VERY LONG!",
            "What can you say about a classic except for simply wonderful. The storyline, the characters, the descriptions of the old south. The civil war and it's horrors, the price you pay for decisions you make. Above all an amazing love story. A classic that will play forever.",
            "This classic story is classified as a Historical Fiction, but is a good review of the Civil War and about the early southern people of that century. I only wished I had paid more attention to my History Class as I found the story facinating. This is my third go around in reading Gone With the Wind. This time on my Kindle. It is one of the first books I have for my Kindle Library.",
            "If you've never read GWTW, put it next on your list! Scarlett O'Hara is a true southern belle who was living in a dream world with nothing more to worry her pretty little head than what to wear to the next party. Suddenly she finds herself doing the work formerly done by her slaves, delivering a baby, and having become a widow due to the War between the States. This is a story I have read 7 or 8 times in the past. This time I purchased it in large print for my 93-year old mother who wanted to read it again. I may need that large print myself before long!",
            "I've read this book a few times now. I always find something new. It is definitely a fascinating read no matter where you grew up. Margaret Mitchell's take on race relations is thought-provoking. Her characters cling to you years after reading it.",
            "\"And she heard for the first time, without knowing it, the Rebel yell.\"I read Gone With the Wind years ago but was so happy to revisit it as a book club choice. I was surprised by how many people struck up a conversation about it as I carried it with me when I travelled. Imagine writing something that still instigates conversations and connections among strangers who have only this book in common? Love it or hate it, you can't deny the impact it's had.The first time I read this I was in my early 20's. I fell completely in love with every moment. Over 10 years later I was surprised by how my reactions to the characters changed. I had less tolerance for Scarlett and increased respect for Melanie. I was more affected by the soldiers and less swept up in the romance. I still thought Ashley needed a backbone...Despite those differences, my love for the characters did not change. My favorite characters are those with flaws. I cannot become completely encompassed by perfection but prefer some characteristics I can love and some I can hate. In that, Gone With the Wind is spot on. I hope I find this book in my hand a third time, another 10 years from now.",
            "It didn't take me long to figure the author was from the South. It painted a southern paradise that was destroyed by the North. However, I did enjoy the story line itself.",
            "What can i say? The book is better than the movie, but even though one cannot on screen (seeing the movie in any other media except the large movie theater screen will never be the same. For instance, the burning of Atlanta, does not and will never have the feeling and movement, and the right reaction on any other medium. Anyone who has seen this cannot disagree, I hope!Otherwise, I believe all has already been said on this, and I would not think Miss Mitchell would appreciate a review as long as her work which is set apart from all other literature. It IS in a class by itself! Thank you very much, WilesWales",
            "This has been my favorite book since I was a child. The book is so much better than the movie. I encourage anyone who has only seen the movie to make sure they read the book.The story starts out with a young Scarlett. She is a spoiled young woman who has never had to work for a thing in her life. She is different than many girls her age, because she thinks for herself. The setting is one where women were still property and a womans role in life was to be a wife and mother. Women didn't need any more ambition than that.Throughout the story, we watch as war changes Scarlett's life forever. Never does one scene happen in a battle, but you can feel the impact of the war in the various characters during the story. The author, Margaret Mitchell, gives us insight into the personal history of other characters in the book. This helps us to understand their motivations.The Scarlett in the book shows her human side more than the one in the movie. In the book it becomes obvious that Scarlett was doing the best she could to survive a terriable situation the world thrust upon her. In the movie, she seems like just a selfish b****. More than one scene in the book brings tears to my eye when I visualize what Scarlett was going through.",
            "My favorite book of all times. The description of the civil war helped me get a feel for what happened during those terrible times.",
            "It's remarkable to feel humbled by art, and that's what happened when I opened Gone With the Wind. I am humbled to be a reader of something so beautiful and full of intricacies that remind me what makes great literature, and moreover why it is so crucial.",
            "As good now as when I read it years ago. Everyone should read this at lest once in their life time.",
            "This book is amazing!! For a 1,000 page read it just zipped by....the plot was interesting, the characters very well described. I finished the book and watched the movie the same night. Neither one was a disappointment!!",
            "One of my all time favorite books, one I have read several times. A true classic. It brings the South to life.",
            "If you loved the movie, you'll love the book. But be warned, the actual book itself (the hardcover published by Scribner) is shoddily made. The binding is falling apart and the pages are coming loose as I read it. I'm hoping it holds together until I'm finished reading it.",
            "This is a classic-- wonderful on so many levels and if you haven't read it then you owe yourself this treat. As a teen I was engrossed and ended up reading it several times over the years. ** small spoiler** As a younger person I always knew that Rhett came back to Scarlett. Later, when I got older, I was less certain that there was a happy ending for the pair and haven't read it since. But I still give it 5 stars because it is brilliant and beautiful and moving.",
            "I have read Gone with the Wind at least 10 times. Every time it is read, I find something missed previously. And every time I read it, it means something different to me. It has motivated me to read other books about that era of time and so I have learned a lot about the Civil War era and how important and significant it was for our country's history. I don't feel that the main thrust of the book was romance, but as in most lives, romance occurs some time, and the people of this novel also find some romance. Scarlett moves from one phase of life to the next with a realists mind except when it comes to Ashley Wilkes.All in all, it is a long book, but one that you won't forget.",
            "This book is a classic. One that I believe all southern women should read and pass down to their daughters. It is a story of love, loss, and an age in which we could never fully understand. That being said, this version's printing is not the best. On nearly every page, there are words or letters that are not fully printed. The hardcover, binding, and dust cover are in wonderful shape. The packaging and delivery, too, were outstanding. The only drawback I see is the printing not being 100% clear on each page. I think if you are interesting in purchasing a hardcover copy, you may wish to try a different version. I hope this is helpful.",
            "Well, I'm 41 years old and have finally read this classic! I'm so glad I read it! It will definitely go down as one of my favorites ever read. Margaret Mitchell is a genious writer who really made me feel like I was right there in the south with all of the wonderful characters!This book is filled with romance, war, politics, friendship, business dealings, deception and so so much more! Lots of characters that entertwine and so much fun to read!I couldn't put it down! It is a big book, but well worth it!Read it! Read it!",
            "Ageless story giving a digestable history of the the American Civil War, a feeling of what it was like to live at that time and an entrancing love story. Loved this edition too, good paper and easy size to hold for a long book.",
            "I read this book as a tween and loved it. I didn't know enough to be offended by Mitchell's whitewash of slavery. I hated Melanie and Ashley, and I loved Scarlett and Rhett, even though I thought Scarlett was some kind of a moron to have the hots for Ashley. When I became a novelist, I realized that my love/hate experience with the characters demonstrated just how crafty Mitchell had been in creating her characters because by then I'd met a bunch of readers who loved Melanie/Ashley and hated Scarlett/Rhett. Something for everyone? You betcha. And her \"I'll think about that tomorrow\" ending was also a brilliant move, equally satisfying to readers who want Scarlett to get Rhett back and those who don't.",
            "I have read GWTW many times and have always longed for an adequate recording of this book. So, when I saw this book on CD at the library I checked it out. What a disappointment!I was so sure that a company with the stature of Recorded Books would select only the best narrator. This should have been given to Flo Gibson--someone with the vocal and acting chops to really do justice to both the narative and character portrayal.Just because someone can act well, it doesn't necessarily follow that she will be a great reader. This actor does, in all justice a fairly good job with Scarlett. However, her pacing and phrasing during the narrative portions was mediocre at best and GWTW has a lot of narrative. Secondary characters are not treated with much differentiation of vocal dynamics, expression or seemingly thought about character. The phrasing was particularly poor and down right irritating at times. It sounded as if this reader gave no preparation to some passages and sat down with the book to read aloud passages that she was seeing for the first time. I am really suprised that the editiors let this pass into publication.The only reason I gave it two stars is because the reader does an adequate job with Scarlett and seems to get the accent dead on. \"Reading\" this performance was so tedious that I did not finish the book. I certainly would not buy this performance. Read the book instead.",
            "This is just such an enjoyable read. Scarlett is appropriately evil, and in the end redeemable.Wonderful novel. I intend to read this again very soon. I had not realized how much better the book is than the movie!",
            "One of my library students finally finished \"Gone With the Wind.\" She's my voracious reader, whom I allow to check out four, six books at a time. If anyone asks why she gets to check out that many books, she is to say: \"Because I'm special.\" It took her two years to read GWTW: she began it in the sixth grade, let it languish, then this year, as an 8th grader, she started over and read it through. Oh! Yes, she loved it!I first read the 1,037-page novel in the 8th grade as well. That was my first reading. I was severely disappointed with the ending. So I read it again and again, fully expecting each time that Rhett WOULD \"give a damn\" and return to Scarlet. This was not to be, at least, not in the annals of concluded fiction. Who hasn't read GWTW that didn't imagine Rhett returning?Just as in real life, fictional characters also behave according to their dictates (granted, their god is different from those of humans) and their circumstances. Would any self-respecting Rhett return to such a cold-hearted, well, you know how she acts and what she is. Even red-petticoat wearing Mammy scoffed at the idea of Scarlet actually winning either man: book-loving, milquetoast Ashley or hot-blooded, fiercely protective Rhett. One is too tame, the other too untameable.So, what is GWTW really: an historical novel of the South and its Lost Cause or a microscopic look at one woman and how she is both damaged and strenghtned by the War Between the States, which meant nothing more to her than an inconvenience. Is it both?Gone With the Wind, is, of course, both historical and character-driven. Two protagonists, Scarlet and Rhett, are pitted against each other, although both are attracted to each other, whether one knows it or not. Ashley is an unattainable dream, a wish fulfillment; Rhett is a hot rod used to prod Scarlet's sensibilities (which are not so sensible).Of course, the real heroine of the novel is Melanie, sweet, sweet Melanie, symbolic steel magnolia, who can kill an enemy in cold blood, yet defend her most erring sister-in-law. Loyal, devout, faithful, responsible, just keep on naming those lovely positive character attributes and you have Melanie. Does such a woman exist? Of course, she does. You and I both know women like Melanie. They run the churches--behind the scenes unless they're needed up front. Always there, always dependable, yet just a little sicky sweet.Scarlet. To the end, defiant. To the end, hoping for that rescue. To the end, just Scarlett. Oh well, we'll think about it tomorrow. Yes, tomorrow.",
            "GWTW, the great American epic, certainly earns its reputation by being a big sweeping novel of the collapse and rebuilding of the American south. Mitchell's research about the many battles in and around Atlanta is evident, as is her knowledge of Southern plantation and urban life. But despite all of her research, her personal bias is evident and clouds her recounting of history. Mitchell is a product of her times, Southern born and bred 70 years after the civil war. She believes that slavery was not so bad, and the slaves were treated like family and were protected and cared for. Her descriptions of free slaves in Atlanta makes one cringe, and she devotes half of chapter 37 to this narrative with quotes like, \"There they conducted themselves as creatures of small intelligence might naturally do. Like monkeys or small children turned loose among treasured objects...\" Another of her characters, Big Sam, a former slave on Tara has tried freedom and doesn't like it and is trying to make his way back to Tara where he knows he will be cared for again. Nowhere in the book does Mitchell make reference to the hard and inhumane lives slaves lived, and the fact that they were property with no rights or lives they could call their own. She even tries to justify the existence of the KKK, saying that the free blacks were running so amuck over of the whites that the Southern men, who had been stripped of their rights by the Yankees, had to do something to avenge these wrongs.Putting aside all of Mitchell's personal bias about slavery, I did enjoy this book and ultimately felt it was a many layered love story between Scarlett, Rhett, Melanie, and Ashley, all intertwined in matters of the heart. Scarlett, the central character and most interesting by far, is a modern woman ahead of her time. She is outspoken, strong-willed and a shrewd business woman. She does whatever it takes to get what she wants in affairs of business and the heart. She is a fully developed character with a range of emotions from pride and pettiness to compassion and understanding (although she tends to lean more toward the former emotions). At times we thoroughly dislike her, others we can relate to her, sometimes we pity her and occasionally we even cheer for her. Mitchell also spends time developing her other major characters, Rhett, Melanie and Ashley, and by the end we feel as if we really know all of them.Despite its 1,000 pages or 41 hours on audio cd, which I listened to, I never got bored, and in fact didn't want to end. The story always moved right along. Someone was always dying, getting married, having a baby, going to or planning a party, plotting, scheming, or getting into or out of trouble. It is melodrama at its best and I am so glad I actually read it instead of just seeing the abridged story in the form of the movie.",
            "wow. loved it. i will definitley be reading this book again and again. i always loved the movie but the book is simply amazing. such complex and interesting characters. its hard to believe the age of the book the style of writing seems ahead of its time. sorry for typos, on my kindle.",
            "I read this book the first time at the age of 13 and 10 years later I love it as much now as i did then. This story is an emotional rollercoaster that will make you hang onto every word. The characters are vibrant, the settings rich, and the tale a timeless one. The ultimate love-hate relationship story.",
            "he falls for a bad woman and thinks that she will turn good for him. But she does not. The latent goodness that he imagines never comes out. He does not mind her bad qualities and in fact admires them. But he does not want them applied to him, at least not all the time. He thinks she can separate them out and give him her good qualities, and just enough badness to make the relationship exciting. It does not work. It works only in romance novels, where the heroine falls for a rotter who is nice to her only while still remaining \"difficult\" but not too much. In this case, where the woman is the bad one (unusual), the author resisted the temptation to give us the happy ending.Rhett likes Scarlett both in spite of and because she is selfish, thoughtless, greedy, a bad mother, shallow, narrowminded, often ignorant and not wanting to learn anything, and lacking in self knowledge. She is also hypocritical, which is actually one of her good qualities. At least she acknowledges that there is something there in the world that is better than her, values superior to hers, characters better than hers, that she should at least pay lip service to. And it's not just lip service. She feels guilt and remorse. She wishes she was better. Let's not be too hard on hypocrisy. It keeps people from worse sins and it protects the innocent.What are her other good qualities? Determination, persistence, courage, shrewdness, resourcefulness, and loyalty to her family, and some notion of decency that keeps her from more seriously bad conduct.Rhett likes her. He finds her fascinating. He sees where she is vulnerable and loves her for that, too. He just wants that she would love him. But for her to do that she has to be a different person. Rhett falls into a classic trap, that the bad person will become good for the one that loves him. Scarlett is too foolish to realize what Rhett offers her, how valuable it is. One problem she has is not wanting to submit. He is willing to submit himself to the loved one, but she is not. She does not want to become dependent on anyone, seeing it as weakness. She is afraid of losing power. He will risk it but she won't.With Ashley, she will be the strong one. So she is not scared of Ashley. With Rhett, he is strong too. And he knows her and can see through her. That scares her. She can't put on airs with him. But Rhett although he teases her does not want to degrade her or change her, except to the extent she will love him. He is willing for her to go her own way. He just wants some honesty from her, so they can be comfortable together and have consensus, so they can get along day to day. He seeks it from the wrong person, however, because Scarlett is not honest about him, herself, or Ashley or Melanie. Rhett fails to see that a person like that cannot be honest with him either.Even at the end when she realizes it has been Rhett all along she still does not get it. She makes a contemptuous remark about Ashley. Rhett corrects her right away. No, he says, Ashley is not contemptible. Rhett is intelligent. He can respect things he does not share in or agree with. He can see the value of Ashley, though they are totally different characters. Scarlett, once she no longer is in love with Ashley, which she never really was, now despises him. She goes in the total opposite direction. That is typical of her and shows a small mind. It also shows that she never knew anything about Ashley. Rhett has a code of honor. Scarlett has no honor.Yet, we like her.If she was just a little more open minded she and Rhett would make a fine pair. If she could see Rhett for what he is, a ruthless harsh man with a code of honor and much kindness in him that he would lavish on her if given a chance. But she does not until it is too late and he has had it with her, with trying to give her love that she never would accept.It's one of the great love stories and the main reason, I believe, the book is still read.The other reason is the description of the old south and the reconstruction era. While I don't agree with all of the author's values, her writing is masterly. She makes you feel what those characters felt. She makes you sympathetic to people with totally different values from your own, which is no mean feat. The reader sees that the characters are wrong about slavery and race and the southern lifestyle, yet feels pity for them. The reader does not root for them to win, yet hopes that things will turn out well for them. When Rhett takes pains to ensure that his child will be accepted by the \"right\" kind of people, the old guard, you feel the same as he does, although you know that it is nonsensical. The old guard will die and it is well that it is so. But you admire Rhett for what he is doing. The book is a testament to the power of good writing, the power of art, the power of a good story. The book is compulsively readable. It is a good example of why we think art is dangerous.The author poured her passion into the book, the passion of the defeated south, and it all comes through on the page. Some parts of the book that go on and on about the south's wounds during reconstruction are tedious as well as historically not factual. For instance, it is not true that the freed slaves had all that power. But when she turns to what the characters feel, she makes you view them with sympathy, even love. The feelings in the book are genuine.",
            "My husband recently bought this copy for me when I showed him the copy I had one my book shelf... The one I have was printed in 1954. It had been read so many times that the spine was missing, pages were loose, some missing, pages stuck together, but I still kept reading it over and over.",
            "what I liked about gone with the wind:Lively description of pre- and post-civil war Southerners, mainly former plantation owners, who were left with no slaves and no money but still not surrendering.Scarlett O'Hara's bold way of overcoming the practical difficulties, even though it was sometimes unpleasant. But overall, to me, it was persuasive.Description of Scarlett's personality was really good and consistent. Thoroughly shallow and thorougly immature. (If there is any doctor or medical student in your family, please go and read about chapter of personality disorders in psychology book. I think Scarlett falls under the category of histrionic personality, as far as I can remember.)Other characters are also well pictured and attractive.Using Belle Watling as contrast to Scarlett, and also Melanie as contrast. Maybe Melanie would have made a better heroine.The end. I guess Scarlett cannot deserve an innocent happy end, but it was good to see that she recognized the truth about Ashley and Rhett at last, ironically via Melanie's death.what I hated about it:Justifying racism, especially KKK. Mitchell's point of view was really disturbing, even after making allowances for her as a pre-war Southerner from heart. OK, Scarlett was the heroine and she might have felt and thought that way pretty much. So Mitchell sticked to it.I agree that the significance of Civil War cannot be reduced to only one point, slavery issue, but Mitchell advocated for plantation owners too much.Rhett made peace with Southerners too easily, while with Bonnie. Also too romantically.Overall, it was good reading, but a little too romantic and inaccurate after all. Good mix of history and romance. If it were for only one of them, it would not have made such a hit. Plus, the force of characters. Mitchell did the best job about characters.",
            "Overall Rating: B+Like all books for which I see a movie adaptation first, I feel as though I was somewhat tainted by the movie. The book is similar though there are some discrepancies in the plot. These details (Scarlett O'Hara's other children by Charles Hamilton and Frank Kennedy, Will Benteen's involvement in Tara, etc) were good deletions from the book for the purposes of the movie production but, like all book to movie transformations, the extra details add an enormous amount of depth to the story.The prose is descriptive but, in parts, not as grand as I expected. Again, perhaps this is the taint from the movie but because the film was so beautifully produced, I expected the same feeling of grandeur from the text.Scarlett O'Hara is an incredibly interesting character; she comes off as a heartless and greedy but also shows an immense amount of passion. She isn't a likable character in most aspects but she does inspire a good amount of admiration for overcoming circumstances well beyond her control. Men play only a passing role for the most part; Rhett Butler is probably the most well developed male character but even he is predictable. Melanie Wilkes is the most pleasant surprise, showing more strength of will than was even broached by the movie. This is most certainly a character driven novel as there are long stretches of time in which very little action happens; on the other hand, there is so much to digest in the last few chapters I felt as though I was always a little behind.There are a few sequels/alternate story lines but, honestly, I'm not interested in the least. I enjoyed the story but it didn't inspire the obsession for me that it has for others.I always try to appreciate the context of language and story when I'm reading story set in another time. That being said, I couldn't help but cringe at the blatant racism displayed in a matter-of-fact way in the story. Racial epithets are frequent throughout the book and the ignorance and idiocy of the slaves/former slaves is taken at a given. This isn't to say it isn't an important part of the book as it was the sentiment of the times but, still, a little hard to listen to at times.I would recommend this to anyone who has a great love of the movie or for those who enjoy long, sweeping epics. In audiobook form, its an enjoyable listen but it is quite a slog.Audiobook Details:The reader, Linda Stephens, had a good balance of accents (she even sings the songs included in the book) and voice depth for the male characters. As much as I enjoyed her reading, the length of the book was so long it would have been refreshing to hear a few other voices. The number of characters in the book is small enough that this would have been an excellent cast production.I didn't recognize any of her other work but I would recommend her as a reader if you enjoy obvious voice acting.Run time was 49 hours, 7 minutes.Published By Recorded Books",
            "This book is wonderful! In history classes we always heard the Civil War from the North's perspective but this book gives us a glimpse into the South's feelings and the changes undergone there. But my favorite part about this book is the descriptions, the plot, the well-developed characters, the language of the times, and especially Scarlett herself. You won't be sorry you read it!",
            "I was reluctant to read Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind because I thought it was basically a romance novel. It is not. It includes some very appealing characters and lots of action.The focus of the novel is on Scarlett O'Hara. She is a magnificent creature, beautiful and strong, but she is completely defined by her selfishness. When she is a fresh young woman, her selfishness is actually appealing - at least to Rhett Butler, a rogue who appreciates anyone who flaunts conventional morality. As time passes, though, Rhett matures and Scarlett does not, and her selfishness has more serious consequences.The plot moves quickly through a series of exciting episodes: battles are won or lost, men and women fall in love, babies are born and soldiers die. The author maintains suspense as we await the defeat of the Confederacy but of course the result is never in doubt. At the end of the war, genteel Southern society collapses and is replaced by coarse commercialism and opportunism. The aristocracy is ruined and its members are forced into trades. Against this backdrop, we watch the romance between Scarlett and Rhett Butler develop and then wane.Mitchell depicts the antebellum South as a happy society with a place for everyone, from the planter aristocracy down to the slaves who thrive under their paternalistic care. This depiction is affecting but obviously idealized. Many subsequent passages of the book, dealing with racial relations during the reconstruction, are even more offensive to African-Americans. Mitchell wrote Gone with the Wind 70 years ago and her views on race are not modern ones. Still, there is no denying her ability as a writer, and there is no denying that Gone with the Wind is a great novel.",
            "\"Gone with the Wind\" by Margaret Mitchell is one of my favorite books of all time. Scarlet O'Hara, the foolish southern belle is in love with Ashley Wilkes, a scholar who won't have anything to do with her. To rebel, she marries his fianc&eacute;e' s brother and when the war breaks out, it turns ugly. She is then forced to move to Atlanta to her husband's house. In Atlanta, Georgia during the Civil War things aren't easy. It is hot and sandy. The sticky humidity is horrible to live in yet the feeling of \"home\" is evident everywhere. There are always barbecues and lazy afternoons up till the war. The south is mostly cotton fields, with little factories while the north is full of manufacturing. Things don't look too good for the south when the war breaks out and to make everything worse, the ports are soon closed off. All too soon Scarlet feels the bitterness of war as her childhood friends die for a losing cause. When she finds Atlanta being attacked by General Sherman she must flee for safety and there is nowhere to go.This story is about a girl who has been spoiled her entire life and then must learn to do things on her own. She faces the fact that she can't have everything and that she has to make sacrifices. Her whole life she has been the brat that depends on everyone else so she can't do anything on her own. She is blinded by her own insolence to the truth that nothing is fair. Sweet Melanie, her sister in law is kind to her and is too sweet hearted to see the wrong in anyone; she doesn't see how corrupt Scarlet' s mind is. She is always on Scarlet' s side despite the horrible things that she does. Scandalous Rhett Butler loves Scarlet for her foul heart and chases her throughout the whole book. Rhett has a history for doing unthinkable things to girls. (Unthinkable at the time; refusing to marry a girl he courted, publicly kissing, etc.) Everyone despises him for making a profit off of the war. All proper people support the failing cause and Rhett makes fun of them. He is a businessman, so nothing is personal till he meets Scarlet. As time progresses, Scarlet comes to realize the damage that she has done with her being wicked to everyone. She literally is and was a spoiled brat. Her suffering teaches her a lesson that we all should learn.If you love historical fiction with a little romance, this book is perfect for you. Scarlet is the perfect Southern belle who is incredible to read about. How she attracts men with her charm and little helpless acts is unbelievable. She is used to having slaves serve her and she treats them with little or no respect until she needs them. You cannot stop thinking about how much you would hate Scarlet if she was real, but you can't stop feeling sorry for her and you want to help her to realize how stupid she is.In this book you have a look at how the south was before and after the Civil War. They were still people with feelings, not horrible people who were wicked. You fall in love with the chivalry and way of life. You also realize how wrong slavery was. Even they knew it was wrong, they just couldn't imagine life without the slave labor. I think that the book is written well, you see why people did things and the reasoning behind their actions. I didn't always agree with what Scarlet did, but I knew why she did things. The book is very interesting and I couldn't put it down at all. I certainly would recommend it to just about anyone. I certainly understand the era better now. The book got me interested in other books about the war and now I can see why people felt the way they did. I can see the good and bad in slavery. I feel that lack of education on the issue is what caused such disastrous effects.",
            "When I first got GWTW to read and saw how long it was I said to myself this is going to be bad and take forever to read, but I went on to read it not knowing why. Many of my friends thought I was crazy reading it, and frankly so did I. Well I started to read it and really got into it. It was so exciting and thrilling I never wanted to put it down. The story of Scarlett O'Hara really touched me and made me realize everthing that we take for granted in life. Also how if you want to be noticed in life and be remembered than be different. Scarlett did many bold things during the war, and even though she had trouble keeping husbands she finally fund a true love one whom she thought she hated. This book was full of surprises and throughly heart warming. It will make any reader make his or her outlook on life so much better, and give them more hope in a &quot;wacky&quot; and strange world like ours.",
            "Last Christmas, I received Gone With The Wind, and before I even went back to school, I had finished it. I read it all day for a week, and when I finished, I felt like my heart had been squeezed. It was so amazing. I have persuaded friends to read it, have posters of it hanging in my room, and simply love it!!! This is one of my favorite books!!!",
            "Just finished reading all the reviews people posted on GWTW and I'm overwhelmed by the love people have for this book. I'll admit it's not my all time favorite (that honor belongs to By Love Possessed, by James Gould Cozzens), but GWTW is still one of the greatest literary experiences a person can have. It's the type of book one simply disappears into, you have no concept of the outside world--your world is Tara, Twelve Oaks, Atlanta, and your friends are Scarlett, Rhett, Melanie, Ashley, et al. You forgive them their indescretions and love them for their humanity. Oh, and I hated the Alexandra Ripley sequel.",
            "I love this book. It is so heartbreaking, tragic, and romantic- it just kind of draws me to it. One of my best friends took three years to convince me to check it out of the library. Finally I did and I wish now that I hadn't waited so long. I'm 13, and I think this book is awesome, and I don't even like romances, and I haven't even finished it yet!!!! This is a must-read for anyone with a flair for the dramatic, and anyone who doesn't like it can just shut their mouths!!!",
            "The thing that stands out the most in my mind is how different it was from the movie. All the little extra things that happen in the book that don't happen in the movie (i.e. Scarlett has more than 1 child) Anyone who loves the movie owes it to themselves to read the book. Don't be put off by the number of pages. You'll come away thinking, Gee I only knew 1/2 the story!",
            "WOW. Possibly THE BEST book I have ever read. My mother took me to see th rerelease just recently at a theater in Dallas, and when it was over I didn't want to leave. I mean, the movie was 6+ hours long and I still wanted more!! So I went and bought the book. My favorite part has to be(besides the fall of Atlanta)the ball in which Rhett auctions Scarlett. It is a perfect example of their feelings for each other. I love all the characters. Timid Melly, Rash Scarlett, Careless Rhett. A must read!!!!",
            "This novel has it all! Where else can you read about love, honor, tradition and free enterprise? Given that she is a woman with charm, beauty and brain's, it's no wonder that the men in her life naturally &quot;flocked&quot; to her. I have read GWTW several times, and I still find myself more enthralled each time. I admire Scarlett's survival instinct, and her raw ambition. GWTW will forever be a timeless american classic!",
            "This is a timeless movie, people of all ages love it. I love the ending, it makes you use your own imagination on what happens after Rhett leaves. The so-called sequel was the biggest mistake the Maragret Mitchell estate could of ever made. As far as I am concerned, that book was no sequel, but a seperate book altogether. They can say whatever they want about Titanic, but let's see if it can last half as long as GWTW.",
            "What can you say about this novel? The prose evokes comparison to Edith Wharton's. The characters live and breathe before you on the page. The setting is set in intimate detail, and it swirls in your mind's eye as you drink in the words. Amazing novel. Scarlett seems much stronger in literature than her flighty character in the film. Once I could escape my preconceived notion of the characters taken from the film, the book became pure joy to read.",
            "Gone With The Wind is a great book,about a young girl, Scarlett, who is a terrible flirt. I read it this summer and I'm only nine, the context wasn't too challenging. M.M. wove the story plot extremely well,it kept me in suspense until the very end, and I want to read the sequal. All in all , if I could, I would give this book infinity stars.",
            "Mind blowing! The book was amazing!! One of the best experiences of my life was reading it. The movie did not do anything much tho' the casting was superb. The sequel was pathetic, Alexandra Ripley: go boil your head! You're nowhere near the real thing!",
            "Gone With the Wind is, without a doubt, my one and only obsession. Since reading it at age 10, I have attempted to acquire everything that I have found to be associated with this extrodinary book. I am now 16 and my love for Gone With the Wind is still exceedingly strong. Alexandra Ripley's so-called sequel was good but her Scarlett and Rhett did not suit the originals. Margaret Mitchell was a superb author with a genious for portraying saucy, touch-me-not characters like Scarlett and smooth,arrogant ones like Rhett. Throughout the book Scarlett's insistance that she would always love Ashley and Rhett would never have that privilege perfectly led up to the ending where she finally realizes that she only wanted Ashley because she could not have him. Gone With the Wind is the best book ever written and in my mind that fact will never change.",
            "This is the best book in the world. If you haven't read it, you have to! This book is so real. You feel for Scarlett and cry with her and laugh with her. It's to hard for me to write in words how wounderful this book is. You have to read it to fell and understand it. If I were you I would drop everything and run to the store and buy, buy, buy it!",
            "When I first picked up Gone With the Wind, I thought that I would be reading it for the rest of my life. To be true, it only took a few weeks to finish and it was the one of the best books I have ever read. I thought that Margaret Mitchell was perfect in her way she described the Civil War with a romantic twist with it. I ended up reading this book for my Honors English class and it was worth every minute of it.",
            "'Gone with the wind' is one of the greatest love stories ever written. It has withstood the test of time and has emerged as a novel, absolutely unforgettable. I am not even American, yet Mitchell's art of writing and the vivid and real-like descriptions enrapture the reader's imagination crossing all regional boundaries. This book has to be bought and not borrowed, to enjoy its splendour completely.",
            "This has got to be one of my favorite books. Historically accurate and breathtakingly written, you get a real feel for what it was like to live in the Antibellum South. I actually finished the book thinking how much I hated Scarlett as a character, but her journey through life was a magnificent ride. I was actually glad that this book was so long, as I turned page after page and didn't want it to end. It's an accomplishment to finish such a lengthy work, but it was well worth the effort. I love this book.",
            "Gone with the wind was one of the best novel i have read so far. The story was so excited and you can't just quit reading it.It holds your emotions through out and you'll never get bore. The character of Scarlet O'Hara was the dominant one in the story but i don't understand why she always behave Rhett badly when he always loved her so much. The most sympethatic character was of Melanie who dies at the end; and she was the one who was taking caring of every body in the home. Ashely character was not bad but i don't know why he always think about the old south. Overall the story is the best.",
            "I simply love this book! I read it when I was 14.Its still the best I've ever read.I'm now 45. The film was good (seen it more than 5 times) but the book is even better. The sequel was a disappointment, the film Scarlet even worse. Nobody could ever write and feel like Margaret Mitchell.",
            "One of the richest books I have ever read. The story completely snares you until the last page, and even when you've finished you will find yourself thinking about it. For anyone who wants an explosion of a story and an outstanding mixture of characters, this novel will always be amoung the top suggestions...",
            "I first read this book at age 13 only cause it was required reading for an English class. I ended up reading all night and was wiped the next day in school. It's impossible to put down.Now 25 years and many thousands of books later it is still my favorite book. I get so mad at Scarlett, we should all be so lucky to find a Rhett and she doesn't appreciate him! Still makes me cry.",
            "Gone With the Wind is my absolute favorite novel. It has great storylines with something for everyone. I read it over and over. It should be required reading for everyone.",
            "gone with the wind is a beautiful story that brings smiles, laughs, gasps, sorrow, tears, joy, and pictures in your mind that are so real, you start to see, smell, taste, feel, hear, and be the story. It is beautifully written, so that it becomes real. Gone with the wind is perhaps the most beautifully written story of all times.",
            "I love this book, because it's so romantic and so classic. You'll never get tired of this book. And it just keeps on going. But even though it's so long, it ends way too soon!",
            "If you've seen the movie but haven't read the book you have to. It gives you a totally different idea on some things than the movie does. The sequel is ok but nothing could be as good as the orginal!",
            "I read it for the 1st time at 13 and have read about once every 1 to 2 years since. I have seen the movie countless times as well. Nothing cures depression like &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. When we lost Margaret Mitchell we lost so much.",
            "I AM 12 YEARS OLD BUT I READ THE BOOK WHEN I WAS 11 LAST OCTOBER. THE BOOK LTERALLY SWEPT ME OFF MY FEET! I READ THE SEQUL AS SOON AS I COULD AFTERWARDS. I DON'T KNOW WHO DIDN'T LIKE THE SEQUL BUT I KNOW IT WAS GREAT!! THE MOVIE ON THE OTHER HAND WAS SORTA, KINDA OKAY. BUT BOTH OF THE BOOKS BLEW THIS GIRL AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!",
            "I RECEIVED A FIRST EDITION 1936 GONE WITH THE WIND. I HAVE COLLECTED THINGS FOR YEARS, THIS BOOK IS THE BEST IN MY COLLECTION.",
            "I am torn. Half of the time I love the intricate characters and the relatonships between them and how it is all so skillfully braided together by a master wordsmith. I have trouble believig it was her first published one. A few flaws like too much obvious foreshadowing of one or two events but truly literature. Half the time I feel like shaking the chracters and the author for the blind racism that was breathed in like the air. That is why I gave this nook only four stars. Yet I would recommend including it in reading for college age or above as and example of these attitudes but accompanied by works of African American author covering the same historical period.",
            "Epic about the Civil War and Reconstruction and a southern belle named Scarlett O'Hara. She goes through three marriages, children, murder and incredible hardships but pulls through. A lot of people don't know this but it won a Pulitzer Pize for fiction in 1937. Everybody knows about the movie that came out in 1939 and is now a classic.I'm not a fan of romance novels OR historical fiction but I LOVE this book. It shows truthfully (I heard) what the South was like before and after the war. It explains the rites and passages of that era...but never in a boring or leaden manner. Author Margaret Mitchell does it in a matter of fact manner that makes it easily accessible. She makes the characters seem like real people (even though Melanie is a little bit TOO saint-like) and draws you into their troubles and worries. Also I've seen the movie at least nine times and this compares favorably to it. There are some significant changes--Scarlett is 16 in the book, she has THREE children and is desribed as not being pretty (which Vivien Leigh certainly was in the movie), but they're minor. In fact the book helps explain some things that were left out of the movie and clarifies some of the actions of certain characters. But, even on its own, it's a GREAT book. VERY long but never dull. A classic. Pick this one up. Ignore the dreadful sequel \"Scarlett\".",
            "After finishing Margaret Mitchell's first and only novel, the one that landed her a Pulitzer Prize and was adapted into a film that is considered one of the best movies of all time, I felt what was to be expected: completely exhausted. Obviously a book this size cannot be completed in one sitting, and (since I was determined not to rush it) it took me the better part of two weeks to get through it; two weeks to struggle through the American Civil War and its aftermaths, not to mention the tempestuous relationship between four larger-than-life individuals: Melanie Hamilton, Rhett Butler, Ashley Wilkes and the infamous Scarlett O'Hara.Of course, I use the word \"struggle\" in a good way, as this is a book that sucks you up into the trials and tribulations of the time, and spits you out the other side. By its end, I was completely drained, something that no book has left me sinceTess of the D'ubervilles: 2500 Headwords (Oxford Bookworms Library).Scarlett O'Hara is a young Southern belle, one of the most popular debutantes in her community. Although she has power over almost every single young man she knows, one continues to elude her. She has loved Ashley Wilkes since she was fourteen years old, and reacts badly when she hears that he is to be married to Melanie Wilkes - a timid young woman that Scarlett despises.After loosing her temper with Ashley (after her declarations of love to him are not reciprocated, despite an admission that he *does* care for her), she is humiliated to find that their encounter was secretly witnessed by the amoral Captain Rhett Butler, a man with a bad reputation who seems oddly amused at Scarlett's conduct. Furious at both men and incapable of understanding either, Scarlett is barely of aware of the political tensions rising around her.Yet Scarlett is about to be swept up in a conflict far beyond the confines of her heart: the Confederacy and the Yankees have declared war, and her entire world is thrown into chaos. Life is whittled down to its most basic elements: hunger, death, love, birth, morals and - paramount to this particular story - survival. In particular, a question that arises during the story is (particularly in relation to Scarlett), what is survival worth?In creating Scarlett, Mitchell has created one of the most intriguing literary figures of all time. Spoilt, selfish, practical, driven, determined, passionate and often unforgivably short-sighted, Scarlett is an individual whose desire for comfort and security gradually erode away at any sense of right and wrong, her development as a complete individual, and her even personal dignity. Just as Macbeth had his ambition and Othello had his jealously, Scarlett's fatal flaw is her inability to *understand*.She does not understand any of the three most important people in her life (Melanie, Ashley and Rhett), she does not understand her own people or what drives them (she is frustrated at their blind ability to the Cause), and she does not understand the sacrifices that must be made in order for her to find contentment...that is, she does not understand until it is too late.This is character study at its most nuanced, for Scarlett is totally believable and understandable, even when she's doing morally reprehensible things. At the beginning of the novel, her faults are somewhat amusing - the fact that she hates the war mostly because it deprives her of the luxury that she loves, and that she loves Ashley even though she finds him unfathomable.Later though, it takes on a more tragic air, as inner peace continues to elude her and we gradually discover the loneliness that comes with total self-interest. It's beautiful, haunting, heart-rending stuff.However, as it seems with every famous book, there is some controversy and it largely concerns Mitchell's treatment of the pre-war South. Mitchell would love to have us believe that the pre-war South was a golden age of chivalrous landowners that treated their ladies like jewels and their slaves like children. When their society is swept away by the winds of war, we are meant to feel grief, as though a living thing has been snuffed out and its memory slowly dying in the remnants of the people who are left to linger on. Ultimately the book is what it is, and I would certainly still recommend it despite some of its dated and overly-romantic views of the South.I actually watched the movie before reading the novel (it was want wanted me to get hold of the book), and I must say that the two go hand in hand. After reading the book I realized how spot-on the choices in casting the movie were, and it was interesting to see what elements of the book the screenwriters decided to cut; semi-important characters like Will Benteen and Archie, and events like the Yankees raiding Tara and circumstances surrounding Gerald's death. Most surprising in the book was the fact that Scarlett actually had three children, one to each of her husbands. The movie kept only Bonnie, and to be honest, I could understand why this decision was made, considering Wade and Ella have very little to do in the story, and are largely ignored, by the author as well as their mother.Ultimately, the driving force in the book is not the attention to historical detail, the clear and vivid prose, or the weight of grandeur and importance that lies on every page; it is the complex and fascinating relationship between the four major characters: the angelic Melanie, the noble Ashley, the rakish Rhett and the driven Scarlett - and I don't just mean how Scarlett relates to each of them. Just as intriguing is Rhett's admiration and protectiveness toward Melanie, Melanie's blind devotion to Scarlett, and the fact that Rhett and Ashley are uncannily similar in thought, though not deed. The quartet makes up one of the most tangled and intriguing set of relationships ever put to paper, and that alone is worth the time it will take to read \"Gone with the Wind\".",
            "Best book of all time. Period.",
            "This book has everything that is needed for a great work of literature. The characters are compelling and believable, the plot and setting are exciting, and the language is just flowery enough to set off the book nicely. Scarlett is a vivacious character, and although I don't really respect or admire her I think she has a monolithic personality. I am so different from her that I find her reactions to the various situations she encounters highly entertaining. My favorite character is Melanie, because she is so like me. I can believe what she says and does and understand her because I would do the same thing usually. Rhett Butler gets on my nerves, though I think he's supposed to. He switches between acting gentlemanly and being a scoundrel. He doesn't know how to treat a lady-- or rather, a woman who isn't exactly a lady. The other characters I don't pay as much attention to, but I enjoy reading about every one of them. One of my first reactions to this book was that it really is perfect for a movie. Some of the descriptions paint a detailed and beautiful picture in my mind, and I read parts of them over and over. I haven't quite finished the book yet, but I have already recommended it to most of my friends, and I shall think of it as one of the greatest-- if not the best-- books I have ever read.",
            "This book is wonderful! It is the best classic ever written! Scarlett, a young lady growing up during the Civil War, struggles through many things. The hardships she faces are unbeleiveable! She has three husbands- Hamilton, Kennedy, and Butler. SHe ends up divorcing them all. There are many sad events in the bood, but there are also some happy moments. This book is a must read!",
            "Without a doubt, the best book ever written. I really felt like I was there, no, not even- I felt like I was her. I could understand what she thought, and would say, even if i thought she was a horribly selfish, blind little fool. The only real merits she had was being able to stick to something and get it, and to survive awful things. I was embarrassed for her,I could see the love that Rhett had held out to her, and wished I could tell her before she ruined the lives of everyone around her, not only herself. I felt the love that Melly had for her, and I wished I could be like Melly. The first 5 times I read it,in 7th grade, I cried really hard. Now, in 9th grade, I'm still it's biggest fan. My friends all think I'm obsessed, and maybe I am, but I love this book!!. Alexandra Ripley never should have tried to write a sequel, because it didn't match the facts, or what we knew of the characters. Scarlett may have chased after Rhett, without a doubt that's what she'd do, but she wouldn't go and have affairs with people, and Rhett wouldn't have married Anne. Anyway, what I'm trying to say, is that this is the best book, anyone who hasn't read it is missing out, and anyone who didn't like it is crazy!",
            "This is the best , I live in the south and I get very upset when I hear people say ,oh that book just show's what slavery was all about . That is when you know that, they have not read it. You would have to blind to not know that it's all about a very strong woman. It's wonderfully written .",
            "When I was twelve, I approached Gone with the Wind with reverence because I had repeatedly heard that it was the best novel ever written. A few days later, I closed the book on the last page, and all I felt was letdown. This is perhaps the greatest danger to succumbing to hype.Gone with the Wind is interesting and certainly very readable (I've read it several times since). Scarlett O'Hara is like Becky Sharp, mostly unlikeable, but still admirable for her gutsiness.While reading the book, it began to dawn on me that most of the gush over Gone with the Wind that I'd heard was about the movie rather than the book itself. I went to see the movie. I was appalled; the casting of the four main characters just didn't seem to fit. I already had a fixed notion in my mind of what the characters were like so probably no actors could meet my expectations. If I had read the book or seen the movie without any expectations, possibly I would've liked them better.",
            "Gone With the wind is a beautiful story about love,perseverence, and a woman's determined mind accompanied by an undecided heart, in a story where she learns to grow and fight through hardships, as she matures and prospers during the civil war.",
            "At times the book vvas tedious and i had the urge to skip pages, vvhich i did. i felt that at parts she dragged the story out too much; parts vvhere she used a page or tvvo to describe vvhat the day looked like or vvhat furnishings vvere contained in a room; these vveren't necessary. i like to knovv the setting of the story, but a vvhole page dedicated to descriptions? hmm...Despite this i really enjoyed the story. it offered a different point of vievv of the civil vvar. the pros and cons of slavery. it vvas interesting. i found that i liked the characters: scarlett and rhett..*smiles* they vvere memorable. very endearing characters.It vvas a romance story that rather sticks in my mind. the story vvas about scarlett and her life..yeha it sounds boring and at times it vvas but...read it. you might like it. just give it a try (read the vvhole book) and then decide if u like it or not. but don't read the story if the only reason is because someone or you yourself forced you to read it. u'll probably hate it if u do.Someday vvhen i've forgotten most of the details of the book i might reread it, but for novv i'll go back to my vampire chronicles.enjoy",
            "I agree with many reviewers that the book is an interesting, engrossing novel. The character development and descriptions are very good, and Mitchell does a good job of describing the motives that drive the characters. I also appreciated the fact that Mitchell did not write a typical &quot;happily ever after&quot; ending. However, I find it disturbing that very few reviewers noticed or commented on the extreme racism in the book. If you believe Mitchell's description of the KKK, you would never know that this was a racist, terrorist organization (and still is). Also, according to Mitchell, only &quot;trashy&quot; black people wanted freedom; the &quot;quality&quot; black people wanted to remain slaves!! These are obviously Mitchell's views of black people, and not just the characters' views. Mitchell took pains to write that not all Yankees were bad and that many were ashamed of the corrupt reconstructionist government they had to uphold. In a biography of Mitchell's life, she is described as refusing to attend a class with a black student who has been admitted to her college. I only hope that most readers noted her obviously racist views and realize that slavery was not as she described it.",
            "Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind is the most remembered Civil War love story of our time. The story of Scarlett O' Hara begins on her father's Georgia plantation, Tara. She was raised as a southern woman should be only the War turns her life upside down when she is forced to marry one man after another in order to keep her beloved Tara. Of course none of these men were her true love, which is Ashley Wilkes who is married to a women whom Scarlett cannot stand. Rhett Butler is a man who is disgraced by his family and most of Georgia for his ungentlemanly deeds. Rhett is captivated by Scarlett's strong will and is determined to make her love him. Scarlett has been through death and starvation and only focuses on never letting anything else ruin her already tarnished life. Scarlett's blind love for Ashley prevents Scarlett from seeing Rhett's love for her. In the end, Scarlett finally recognizes whom she truly loves but it might be too late.",
            "I first read this novel the summer I was seventeen. It is a novel that has been handed down in my family for three generations -- and now I know why.Scarlett O'Hara is a spoilt flirtacious southern belle on her father's rich plantation. All the other girls in the county hate and depise her because she has a way of getting her charming claws into their men -- ALL of the men, that is, except \"the long suffering Mr. Wilkes.\"Ashley Wilkes is young, blonde, handsome -- and taken. He is destined to marry Melony Hamilton -- the only woman in the county besides Scarlett's mother who doesn't depise her (ironically enough).Scarlett convinces herself she is in love with Ashley Wilkes, but the truth is she only wants him for the simple reason that she can not have him. Her want becomes an obsession that spans over the next four years of the Civil War and even after. Ashley turns her down in more than one entertaining love scene, one of which is over heard by none other than the the famous Rhett Butler.Rhett Butler is smitten by Scarlett the moment he first sees her because he recognizes in her the same qualities he values in himself: he is a social outcast without clean spot on his reputation. According to the South's unwritten social laws, he is not a gentleman but a scallywag and a cad because he refused to marry a girl he'd taken out without a chaperon. But Rhett is fearless and defiant when it comes to social rules and lives a comfortable life safely outside of \"good\" Southern society which means he openly associates with prostitues and therefore, knows about women's undergarments (something a man is supposed to pretend not to know about).But Rhett's sudden and adrent spark of love for Scarlett is doused somewhat when he learns of Scarlett's apparent love for Ashley Wilkes. He then spends the greater part of the novel fruitlessly pursuing Scarlett and trying to make her forget about Ashley. He married her, saying with a laugh that he \"can't wait all his life to catch her between husbands.\" But Rhett soon finds after the birth of their first child that married life with Scarlett is hell. He can't make love to Scarlett knowing that she's sighing for Ashley Wilkes, and he can't bear to sit across from her at supper anymore knowing that she wants Ashley there. And when Scarlett turns Rhett from her bed it hurts him so that he's driven to mad drinking.And though Scarlett moons after Ashley and fantasizes about him, she slowly but surely falls in love with Rhett. But here's the twist: once Scarlett realizes her love for Rhett and runs to him to proclaim it, she finds that Rhett's deathless love has, well, died, and that he just doesn't \"give a damn\" anymore.This is probably my favorite part of the movie version. I love when Scarlett runs through the mist to find Rhett at home, sitting listlessly before the window with an open suit case on the bed. I must've watched the ending more times than the rest of the movie put together. But nothing moves me more than Scarlett and Rhett's last parting words:\"Rhett! If you go, where shall I go, what shall I do?\"\"Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.\"",
            "THIS IS MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE NOVEL!! I don't care if I sound obsessed; I AM! Sure, I could offer the same criticism that others give (Mitchell was racist, Scarlett was a brat, the ending stunk), but regardless. I'm looking at the bigger picture here. WHAT A SAGA.Scarlett--though I admit, she was a witch sometimes---is truly admirable. She personifies the concepts of tenacity and perseverence, refusing to give up. I look up to her for being fierce, strong, opinionated, and a feminist. She was brave and ardent, and I love her.I forgive Mitchell for being racist in her writings, because she was most accurately portraying that time period. Honestly, I forgive any fault of the book, it was just so good!The conclusion...eh. I would have ended it at the end of the second-to-last chapter. But I'm not the author, I have no room to talk. She did a brilliant job illustrating the lives of members of the Confederacy, so lets give her proper credit and not denounce her.What else is there to say? These online reviews couldn't encompass it all, BY FAR. The novel was just delicious. I ate it all in less than two months' time (and it's a hearty meal, believe me). It surpasses the movie in my opinion, but both are exquisite masterpieces. READ IT READ IT READ IT READ IT!",
            "Gone With The Wind. Those immortal words are etched into the brains of generations. With those words come the acclaim and popularity it earned. To me, it was nothing more than a book. The swriting style of Margaret Mitchell is wonderful and I think that she brings authenticity to her work. That and only that is why i gave it four stars. Many of my female peers fell in love with the book. Maybe it was meant to be a feminine novel, not written for the eyes of a young man such as myself. It took me longer than most books to read and when I had finished it it left me with no sense of awe or despair at not having a decent sequel(which I am told is terrible). No, it left my with only one thought &quot;I wonder if I wasted my time.&quot;The story follows the majority of the life of Scarlett O' Hara, a ruthless southern belle, whose dellusions of love lead her to keep her foothold in the world. During her travels (or should I say misadventures?), she comes across a man named Rhett Butler. Rhett is a smart, dark, and deceptive character who flaunts his wealth and charm. He would have to be my favourite character because, as is so uncommon tday in literature, his character was believable and dark. His openness with his shortcomings and his lifestyle give him a sense of nonchalance that is a credit to Mitchell's style. However this is where my enjoyment stopped. The story seemed to drag unnecessarily and I did not speed through it as I thought I would when i heard how &quot;wonderful&quot; it was. The storyline was relatively simple and easy to understand, but it just does not gain my utmost appreciation as a classic in literature.",
            "This is the most absolutely wonderful book that was ever written! Margaret Mitchell truly makes you feel as if you were living in the Old South. This timeless novel has absolutely everything and anything that you could want in book- danger, fantasy, nightmares, dreams, lost loves, romances, daring heroines and heroes, villains, beauty, history, architecture, culture,... I could go on forever! I fell in love with Scarlett and Rhett the first time I read it. Yeah for the Confederacy!",
            "Gone With The Wind gives whoever reads it a very good story but it also teaches you a lot about the Civil War. The story starts at the beginning of the Civil War and it follows the life of Scarlett O'Hara for around 12 years. She is 16 at the beginning of the book.For about ten years of her life she thinks she loves Ashley Wilkes, only to realize that she had never loved Ashely and had tricked herself into thinking she did. At the beginning she tries to get Ashley to marry her instead of his fiance, when he doesn't, she marries Charles Hamilton.Throughout the story she and everyone around her loses everything that was dear to them. Almost everyone lost immediate family members in the war and Scarlett's mother , Ellen died from a fever and her father died after being crazy following Ellen's death. Scarlett struggled for a long time trying to keep her plantation, Tara, together. Scarlett and her family nearly starve for a long time until a man named Will helped them with the farming.Then, Scarlett married her sister's fiance for his money. He died a short while after. The night after his death, Rhett Butler, a man that the town hates because he was a scalawag, asked Scarlett to marry him. After a while she said yes. Within a few years, Scarlett gives birth to a baby girl and Rhett Butler loves her more than anything else. Scarlett loves her, but she never shows it, so Rhett raised Bonnie one his own. Everything is fine until it takes a turn for the worse. Bonnie dies and Melanie Wilkes, Ashley's wife dies. It was then that Scarlett realized how much she loved Melanie and it was then that she finally got her life straightened out.Overall, I think that Gone With The Wind is and excellent book. I would recommend it to highschool students.",
            "What else can be said about this great American epic? The classic coming of age book for many girls here in the South when they turn thirteen, it contains the whole story of the War Between the States amid a compelling love story. You will be glad when you read the book that you don't live in a time when you had to be in mourning for seven years. But, you will miss the era when honor, cause, and respect where such important issues.",
            "Even my husband enjoyed this one! This novel is the perfect combination of romance and action! If you have only seen the movie you haven't gotten the rest of the story! Once you read this one you will be hooked and Scarlett will have to be next! Enjoy!",
            "Gone With The Wind the American classic is a story of love and war in the 1860's. The main character Scarlett O'Hara was a bold women who fought the hardships of the war and also putting up with the man who infuriated her the most Rhett Butler. Rhett Butler was a rich man from Charleston who fell in love with Scarlett during the war. He also had a opinion about everything which Scarlett hated because she was very hot tempered. An incident in the book that made Scarlett my favorite character and also why I like the book so much was when Rhett Butler left her, Mammy and Melanie in the middle of the road when they were going back to Tara from Atlanta.The reason I liked this part so much was she didn't give up and she told Rhett how she felt and how she hated him for doing that. In those days girls really couldn't say their opinions but she did it any ways and showed she was strong . She was very determind to get what she wanted and she did. I really liked this book for many reasons. It gave you a description of how the war really was and it made you realize what they went through when they fought the war. Another reason I liked the book was the characters. Scarlett was a good example because she was a very lively character.Also Rhett Butler he was very good because he was very mysterious and you never knew what he would do next. I would recommend this book to people of all ages. The reason i think this is because it is a great love story and it gives you a understanding of how the war was really . I would defitnetly read this book again.",
            "Me being 11yrs. old didn't think that I would like this book. Boy was I wrong. This is my favorite book of all time! The only thing that I didn't like about the book which I know almost everybody will agree with me on is that it ends so suddenly not even giving you a hint to the outcome. Margaret Mitchell is so good that she can even capture an eleven yr. olds mind with an adult book. This book is easy to put people you know in the characters spots and just sit there all day and daydream a new ending. Did I mention that I loved this book?",
            "If you think you know what this book is about because you've seen the movie then think again. Each time I have read it I discover something new. So many richly complex characters and scenes were left out of the film due to time constraints. It is my favorite book of all time, one of those rare works of literature that you can open up to any page and immediately become engrossed in.",
            "This book sold 4 Million copies in one week! Then it was made into a movie which stayed in theaters for 30 years. No story ever told can compete with this one. It is just as compelling now as it was all those years ago and will remain so indefinitely.",
            "There is no excuse not to read this book. It is amazing and would be loved by all who read it.",
            "Or at least finest I've come across. Perfect in every respect. Demands to be read from cover to cover as quickly as possible. A finer contemporary drama you will not find.",
            "This is by far the best book I have ever read!! I loved Ms. Mitchell's vivid descriptions and her enchanting characters. You just can't go wrong buying this book!!!",
            "Reading I have started since kindergraten, and never have I read better. Gond with the Wind is a book of history and it is timless.",
            "I have read this book about 4 times. I also own the DVD.This is the most suitable book for romantic souls.",

            "The power of this narrative of the American Civil War and the Reconstruction period after the war is overwhelming. Scarlett O'Hara is the centerpiece of this story from the beginning to the end. It is much more than a story of love, rivalry, and misadventure. It is all that and more. It offers the reader a portrait of the Confederacy and the candid view of life there as filtered through the eyes of Scarlett. It is Melanie Hamilton and Ashley Wilkes who represent the values of the old South and the ambition of Scarlett and the cynicsm of Rhett Butler reflect the newly emerging South of the Reconstruction.",
            "This book is unlike any other that I have encountered thus far. It is a dinamic story of a firey young southern girl forced to come to grips with the realities of the war-torn south. Once you start reading you will not be able to put this book down. The details that Mitchell includes are breathtaking and make you feel as if you are back in the days of the old south. The character of Scarlett O'Hara is inspiring. This book is many stories in one; it is a coming-of-age piece, a love story, a war story, and a historical novel. All of these genres come together to create a captivating work of art.",
            "Gone with the wind is one of those storys that wraps you up into the story waiting to find out what is going to happen next to Scarlett. Yet it is the most to deal on real life issues back in the 1860's and post civil war. Even if it is fictional.",
            "A wonderful fascinating historical novel, an intriguing character study, and yes, of course, a tragic love story - this is one of 20th century masterpieces and a must-read for anyone.And this doesn't mean that the characters of the book are perfect or their actions right - instead the imperfections of Scarlett, Rhett and others are what make the story work. Mitchel makes them so that anyone really can identify with them at some point, making the story very realistic and believable. No they are not perfect and their bad traits are not extolled or forgiven, as some reviewers here might think. Indeed, the events in the story reflect this point. (Why do u think Scarlett is left all alone in the end?) If anyone thinks that giving your daughter Gone with the Wind to read would make her think or behave like Scarlett at her worst they are very, very wrong and they just don't get the main idea of the novel.Its so sad, frustrating, bittersweet and great and i love it. I very much recommend this book.",
            "Gone With the Wind, by Margaret Mitchell, is an amazing book based rural Georgia from the Civil War antebellum to Reconstruction. Scarlett O'Hara begins as a sixteen-year-old belle of the county, but ends up facing perils the kind of which she could never imagine. In the book, love holds Scarlett together, but in the end fails her. Mitchell's style is unique and distinguishable. The moral value of this book is unusually displayed by the contradictions to it made by Scarlett. I loved reading about Scarlett's relationships with her friends and, more interestingly, her enemies. Though it is sometimes difficult to like Scarlett, it is impossible to ever hate Mitchell's messages throughout this amazing epic novel.",
            "I agree with the woman from the UK. This is ridiculous. Slavery was horrible but guess what ? It happened, so I guess what we should conclude from what you are saying is that we should just forget about Hitler and the concentration camps and pretend like it never happened. The world can be a horrible place so while we're here why don't we face the facts and try to learn from history. Besides, history repeats itself. So, back to the book. WOW! This is the best book I've ever read. Reading this book you realize how horrible slavery was but also what hell Southerner's went through during this period. After all nearly one-fourth of the population of the U.S. was wiped out because of the Civil war and it tells about the people who really changed the South, the carpetbaggers! I saw the movie and after having read the book I can't believe some of the powerful scenes they left out. Like when the Union soldiers were going through Tara and almost took Charles' sword. Or when the Calvert girl came to tell everyone she was going to marry. It just goes on and on. Did you know that MM wrote GWTW for her own pleasure and never thought of herself as a good writer. One day a publisher friend from NY dropped by and saw hundreds of sheets of papers in dissaray and asked if he could look at them. MM had refused to let anybody read what she had been writing but said yes to this guy for some reason then felt self-consious almost immediatley after he left and asked for them back the next day. He said he would never give them back and published them.",
            "Gone With The Wind (GWTW abbreviated for those who are hardcore fans) was a tremendously successful novel, earning its well-deserved title as an American literary masterpiece. Spun from the imagination and supposedly blurry, slightly realistic accounts of Margaret Mitchell and her friends (Mitchell said the characters were based on some of her acquiantances, as she grew up listening to Civil War accounts in the South), the novel took America by storm in the 30's. It was the Great Depression, a time that severely hurt the nation's economy. We were then a nation on the brink of war (sounds like our present time, does'nt it ?), World War II being just around the corner. Mitchell had written short novels that are unfortunately unknown to most readers and sold rarely in bookstores, but GWTW was her only great novel, her magnum opus, her legacy. She took it upon herself to write the great American novel, and she managed quite well. The novel deals with the life-altering Civil War, its effects principally on the main characters, a coquettish, strong-willed, male-manipulating survivor Southern belle, Scarlett O'Hara, an equally strong and slick man of ill-gotten means, Rhett Butler, Ashley Wilkes, of whom Scarlett is enamored and who is a reserved, elegant aristocrat and his wife Melanie Hamilton. The barrage of characters, from the Tarleton twins, to the comedic, gossipy Aunt Pittypat, to the slaves, including Mammy. The novel is very long, and of course, in order to truly enjoy the epic scope of the narrative, one must take time to read. A first read this novel in junior high, devouring every page, immersed in the tragedy and the triumphs that Scarlett faced during what must have been the hardest time for Americans in the nineteenth century. Similarily, the movie, in my opinion, related to the Americans of the 30's, having gone through the Depression, looking forward for resurrection and triumph despite all odds. As Scarlett's motto and unforgettable creed went, &quot;Tomorrow is another day.&quot; Themes of hope, nostalgia and unrequited love abound in this masterful story. I hope you read the novel if you have not and then view the film, rather than other way around. I saw the film first, then read the novel. You will find how DIFFERENT the book is from the movie, and how much more grandeur there is in the novel and how much more developed the characters are (i.e. Scarlett is supposed to have had children with her two husbands before her marriage to Butler). It was not difficul to imagine the characters in the novel looking and speaking as the actors did in the film - Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh, etc. But if you read closely, the characters are definately Southern, bourgeois, prudish, scandalous and quite Victorian in manners. Five stars for the great American novel, five stars for Margaret Mitchell. Gone With The Wind has stood the test of time.",
            "Okay. Raise your hands. How many have seen the movie but not read the book? Come on raise em! I thought so. I'm not taking anything away from the film. I love it, one of my favorites, watched it a gazillion times, but I just read the book for the 2nd time, the first time was, well long time ago. Even though I thought I knew the whole story, I realized there was so much more to the characters and the story.This tale of the South begins on the eve of the Civil War, and centers around a Southern belle, Scarlett O'Hara. Scarlett is a young Belle, with many beau. The young men are buzzing around her. She is the daughter of a wealthy plantation owner, she is spoiled,concieted, and shallow. Her sole purpose in life is to look good and catch a worthy husband.She has hope only for one though,Ashley Wilkes, who is bethrothed to Melanie Hamilton. Her whole life changes, as war breaks out, the Yankees are winning, many of her beau are dieing in the war. She is forced to do things,never in her life would she have thought she must. She must nurse the wounded, work her father's plantation, (as most of the slaves have been set free by the Yankees, or have just run off),she must care for her family, and save the faimly home from the Yankees. Even as the war ends, she still must continue to keep \"Tara\" (the family plantation) out of the hands of Carpetbaggers, and Scalliwags.Scarlett at her young and tender age will do whatever it takes to keep from going hungry and tattered like the rest of the southerners. This includes taking up with the likes of one Rhett Butler. Although the rest of Atlanta see's him as a low life friend to the Yankees, Scarlett see him as a means to end.He is rich, and like Scarlett doesnt really care what anyone else thinks. Rhett comes in and out of her life over the next several years always seeming to come to her resue, and they eventually marry, but not, according to Scarlett for love.Throughout the story we see Scarlett getting stronger with every tradgedy that besets her, and there are many. The loss of her parents, 2 husbands, a child, and of course the war. But what we also see is the loss of her youth and and the way of life she was born to have. In their place we see courage and tenacity,a woman who could run her own business (unheard of in those days), a woman who could shoulder anything that might come her way.It takes the death of Melanie for Scarlett to realize, what she already has in her life that is good. But is it too late?As I mentioned in the beginning, there is so much more in the book then you will see in the movie. There is a depth in some of the characters, like Melanie and Gerald O'hara(Scarlett's father), and more light is shed upon the relationship between the planatation owners and the slaves, we understand Scarlett,and her love for the land a little more, and see more to Rhett. There are other characters too, important to the lives of the main characters, Scarlett has two children besides Bonnie, there is a convict that has entered the lives of all, and the realtionship with Mammy is touched on more so than in the movie. Mrs. Mitchell never forgets to give us descriptions of the land,the war, and the people that will stick with you. We also get more of the history of the war and it's ravages on the South, the aftermath, the formation of \"The Klan\", and much more.Although we might disagree with the politics of the story, like how women were thought of, or the treatment of African American as slaves, Mrs. Mitchell paints us a clear vision of how things were. It was an era in American History that is, well, \"Gone With The Wind\"If you have never read this book or seen the movie, I tried only to give a taste of the story. I hope it has wet your appetite, read the book first, you won't be able to put it down.You will get lost in another time and place.If you have only seen the movie, this will fill in the blanks for you, and you can picture the faces and voices of the characters you know.Happy reading........Laurie P.S. There is also a wonderful sequel to the story calledScarlett: The Sequel to Margaret Mitchell's \"Gone With the Wind\", by Alexandra Ripley(see my review for book details)",
            "This is, beyond all doubt, the greatest novel of all time. It has everything: characters that leap off the pages, a thrillling plot, a powerful philosophy, and a universality that extends beyond the events it catalogues. This is an epic of mammoth proportions that tells not only one story but explores a whole way of living. I wept, cried, and laughed reading this book. This is more than a novel, it is a manual for living. This is not because the characters are perfect or even wholly admirable but because through their experiences we have the opportunity of seeing the world through a completely new lens. Add to this the fact that Scarlett and Rhett have one of the most exciting romances of all time and through this novel we literally have the opportunity to relive the passionate struggles of the Civil War. More than being a story about North and South, it is a story about rising out of the ashes of your own destruction and fighting on when all hope is gone. This is truly a novel that everyone should read. It made me a stronger person and taught me that no matter how bad things get, &quot;Tomorrow is another day.&quot;",
            "I still love it! and it is still remains my favorite novel. I read this as a teenager, and now again 30 years later. To me, it is one of those books that makes me sad for people who don't read, who miss out on the profound life altering and enjoyable experience that books can bring.After reading it again, later in life, I see that it was a book that could have been a huge influence to my early thinking. When I was in High School, early 70's, I was the only one of my friends and family who spoke out against racism... and in a time of racial riots, high emotion and tensions. Racism has always been a passionate issue for me...also woman's issues. The unfairness and stupidities, some blatantly obvious to me, and some not so obvious. Some discrimination I was unaware of for years, even though I looked for them, and was super sensitized to them. But we were all so brain washed, right from the cradle. It is still an evolving process of enlightenment, and will be for a long time to come. These issues have been such passionate issues for me... I now believe, after reading it again, that Gone With the Wind, has been one of those books, that did help inspire my thinking in those formative years. Margaret Mitchell was a great and courageous thinker....before her time. Her insights and knowledge on the Civil War in particular, were impressive for a woman of her times. Her thoughts of the motivations and impetuous behind wars, and the tearing down and building up of civilizations, is inspiring and thought provoking.In the character of Scarlet O'Hara, the rebellious, courageous, strong, engaging, not so sweet Southern bell, she wonderfully sheds light on the foolish traditions and conventions of society, particularly for the women in that unique disintegrating society of Southern Gentility. I think, the brilliance in the creation of that character and the story line allows her to get away with a very feminist and enlightened attitude, that I am sure was still very unpopular, but struggling to get free, in the 1920s and 30's.Also the ambiguities of racism, that existed in the North and the South, she subtly weaves in and about her story. All of it led me to wonder what the attitudes were in Margaret Mitchell's day, and what reading materials had shaped her thinking, during her life.To think that it was her first novel is mind boggling to me. Her thoughts and ideas are still timely today and indeed are timeless. I feel we missed out on some great works when she lost confidence in herself and refused to write again, then was killed so young. Maybe she just lost her heart and spirit, fighting to be herself in a hostile world toward women, and became a burnt out blazing star. I think she was someone I could've related to (not saying that I am a burnt out star LOL, maybe a burnt out light bulb LOL) I would have liked to have known her. She was an independent, rebellious spirit, intolerant of stupid ideas, conventions and traditions imposed by society, which only serves to keep certain segments of the population in control, of men and the wealthy.For a Southern Bell to have had such spirit, passion and intelligence, must have been very hard and lonely for Margaret Mitchell, during her lifetime. She was obviously a very thoughtful and well read person. She must have put up a good fight, I am sure, for her day and circumstances, she must have come up against a lot, and must've certainly been a very special person as well as gifted and talented.Through her skillfull and inspired writing, it was like she was actually there, a witness of the times.... maybe when she conceived the idea for the novel, or maybe, as a young child, civil war veterans could still have been alive and telling stories to her personally ... just think ... wow ... A great book, thought provoking, exciting, informative, and just plain good story telling. I could really imagine the feel and taste of the gritty dusty roads, smell the mud from the rain and the horse dung on the streets, I could imagine hunger, what hominy tastes like, what tight stays feel like, what an unwashed man smells like, I could imagine what the countryside, farms and cityscapes were like, the sounds, sights and smells. The whole experience inflamed my imagination and absorbed my mind.My only criticism of the book is that it could have been edited a little better, some areas were repetitive, but really it only adds to the charm of the book. If it was too perfect it would have been too sterile and may have missed some of the innocence of emotion that carried through. I am glad I read it again....Kathy Struewing",
            "This book is just one of the best books ever. I can read it over and over again. I just love the story, the characters, the history, everything!Undoubtly the best book ever written....",
            "When I saw this book on my mom's bookshelf two years ago, I wanted to read it because I thought that that would make me a &quot;grown up&quot;. But reading it was better than that. I was fascinated by the Southern way of life, as I had only heard bad things about the Confederacy in my history class (it was soooo one-sided). It seemed so beautiful, what with the chivalrous gentlemen and their demure ladies. It was a world where Melanie completely belonged, but Scarlett was in the wrong age. I was so frusterated to see how Scarlett had to forfeit friends and society to keep herself alive. It's hard to like her, but it's impossible not to! She's cold, dismissive to her friends, and uses her looks to get her way- but you like her anyway, no matter how much you admire the other characters for their sweetness and chivalry. You like that she's willing to do everything for Ashley, for Gerald, for Tara. And you're upset when Rhett leaves her even though she completely deserved it. She can get things done, and she will, and we like her. For me, the face of the Confederacy will always be the face of Scarlett O'Hara- con artist, tart, hypocrite, and so much more. And yet still, a part of me wishes that I had been a part of that face.",
            "...This great book.... I read it when I was 16 and since then I read it countless times. Every character and all the dialounge I love. Charles declaration of love to Scarlett is sooo cute. GranMa's Fontaine's remincing of the massacre of her family was perfectly done. Mammy's telling of Rhett going out of his mind after Bonnie's death. Scarlett promise to never going hungry again is a complete classic that every Southerner should learn and know by heart. Melanie's giving birth to Beau is so real. NO women that small and narrow should give birth and if she does she should thank God she lived after the birth. Scarlett's telling Melanie to scream and not to be brave sounded like my mother when Mother told my sister to yell all she wanted. My nephew weighed eleven pounds. There is so much I want to say here. I really will never understand the non-reading public. The stories here in this book are so beatiful. Even if the Story is old and long how can persn resist after the first page. Scarlett to me is a real person. So what if she is spoiled brat. At least she knows what she wants. But...her being in love with Ashley is beyond me. He is pathetic. Rhett. Wow!! What a man. Now that is a Man I would love to have for myself. Again I will never under Scarlett here. What was she thinking in letting a fine man like Rhett to get away mooning over a man like Ashley, then realizing too late that she never \"really\" loved him? WELL, I least I hope I know she had to have gotten him back. And, I'm not talking at all about that horrid book \"SCARLETT\" either. I don't need that book to continue the story for me. I like to think I can continue the story in my mind. After all tomorrow is another day.",
            "Margaret Mitchell's requiem of the South succeeds to embrace both the reader and her topic because of the tremendous blend of themes which resound throughout this masterful novel.First, she introduces us to the concept of peace versus war: \"All wars are sacred, to those who have to fight them. If the people who started them did not make wars sacred, who would be foolish enough to fight?\" And, of course business pragmatist Rhett Butler concludes, \"All wars are in realty money squabbles. But so few people ever realize it. Their ears are too full of bugles and drums . . . \" This dialogue of sanctity of war versus business pragmatism constantly resounds in the book.Secondly, is how men treat other men. And, within this theme are numerous subtopics. The most obvious is the North versus the South. \"Arrogance and callousness for the conquerors, bitter endurance and hatred for the conquered.\" When you start a war - know that at the end you still have an enemy, and that enemy's feelings toward you may be stronger and more bitter! The other obvious theme is white versus black. Slavery versus freedom for the \"darkies.\" And, although that serfdom appears to symbiotically exist in the Camelot of the Georgian south, Ashley Wilkes tells Scarlett O'Hara at one time that had there been no war and had his father died with slavery still intact, he would have freed his slaves as his methodically conceived logical conclusion was to do the right thing : free men.Ashley Wilkes, who displays another great theme of old antebellum South's gentlemen in the new world of the Reconstruction South, is both hero and goat. Rhett Butler always tells Scarlett that Ashley's days of importance ended when his environs were burnt to ashes at the war's end. She never agrees, at least until the end. And, while she disagrees with Rhett about Ashley, they gang up on her on yet another masterful man versus man theme: employment of convict labor. Treated worse than slaves, convicts are the backbone to cheap labor after the war. But, for their hard work they are beaten and fed little and paid less. Ashley, in her post-starvation period, will do almost everything to avoid experiencing hunger again - including hiring white northerners to be her conscripted laborers.Thirdly, we learn about truth versus appearance. Rhett and most of the old South depict the wonderment of southern civility - never say a bad thing about anyone, and always show respect and manners to those about you. This applies to many slaves as well. Ashley and his wife, Melanie (Melly), are embodiments of such gentile mannerisms. Scarlett's mother Ellen was another. Scarlett's father, Gerald O'Hara, and Scarlett are not. But, Scarlett and her father were truthful. The Irish in father and daughter refused to fub, they refused to be concerned about the foderol scurried about by gossip - holding such lack of care when the idle gossip festered to outright defamatory lies. Rhett, who loves the lack of deception in Scarlett's character, often criticizes his peers for their hypocrisy. Rhett admits to engaging in the same for purposes of business; but, as a man he refuses to be known as another who says what he does not mean. But, Rhett, as time progresses in the book, succumbs to the gossip and engages in the very hypocrisy he despises.Fourthly, the issue of uneven playing field resounds. Rich versus poor. Slave owner versus slave. Business owner versus convict labor. South versus North. And, hidden within these themes is Mitchell's greatest announcement: feminism. Scarlett who owns businesses after the war, is criticized by all men and societal women for engaging in a man's world. Even with her success, she is snubbed by the hob nob crowd. But, perhaps greatest in this theme is the concept of men having rights which women cannot. Rhett gallivants with the local prostitute Belle without concern, while one emotional hug held by life-long friends and neighbors Scarlett and Ashley is identified as \"adultery.\" When Rhett confronts her about this, Scarlett retaliates, \"You are nothing but a drunken beast who's been with bad women so long that you can't understand anything else but badness. You've lived in dirt too long to know anything else. You are jealous of something you can't understand. Good night.\"Other themes also exist: building versus destroying; growing up versus growing old; Catholics versus Christians; love for family versus love for spouses; raising children versus burying children . . .As these themes ebb and flow and occasionally eddy in this ocean-sized novel, the characters' personalities grow and become embodiments of many stereotypical Southern mainstays. And, to add to the characters, Mitchell uses incredibly detailed phonetic spellings for the crackers' and slaves' dialogues. Her detailed description of people's clothing and household interiors (and exteriors) brand indelible images into the readers' minds. This is writing!Mitchell, whose own life is a mixture of angelic Melly and defiant Scarlett, had three marriages and worked (as a journalist) in a man's world. She knew that her publication would be much more difficult than a man's work - especially one of such largess. But, like Scarlett, she persevered and triumphed. Mitchell's name remains among the most known in the American literary world - not bad for a small girl from Atlanta.So many passages of this book flow with delicate prose that make it an incredibly easy 960-page read. In Pat Conroy's preface, that great southern writer states, \"This is The Illiad with a Southern accent, burning with the humiliation of Reconstruction. . . Gone with the Wind was not just a book, it was an answer, a clenched fist raised to the North, an anthem of defiance. If you could not defeat the Yankees on the battlefield, then by God, one of your women could rise from the ashes of humiliation to write more powerfully than the enemy and all the historians and novelists who sang the praises of the Union.\"",
            "Gone with the Wind is the story of Scarlett O'Hara (and so much more). When the reader meets Scarlett, it is pre-civil war in the South. The reader gets to see plantation life on Tara and in the Country as it really was. Mitchell takes the reader through the Civil War, how life changed for those that didn't go of to war, how life changed for everyone after it, the mentality of those who survived it and how they lived afterwards. The reader gets to watch these character develop and change with the times.Mitchell's character description is amazing! As a reader, you feel transported into this world, as if these characters are your friends, and as if you are a part of this town - just another neighbor. You will feel for each and everyone in some way at some time. You'll not want to put the book down, nor will you want it to end....What can one really say about this book other than it is a great read and one that everyone should pick up!",
            "If you read the other customer reviews, you will definitely guess that people love this book. They really, really love it.I read this book primarily because it is such a major piece of 20th century American Literature and film and I'm glad I read it. Several friends saw the book on my table and assumed my wife was reading it. I took some teasing over it.I liked it more than I expected to but I couldn't quite get past some of the views expressed or supported. I do think Mitchell goes further than just showing how southerners thought of blacks and actually has sympathy for some of the attitudes.Mitchell writes a lot of good scenes and social situations. Scarlett is quite a character. She is selfish, egotistical, forceful and mean. She's also loyal, smart and has incredible inner strength. To Margaret Mitchell's credit, she wrote an incredibly strong female character who is consistently interesting.For a 1000ish page book, it moves quickly but I really did find it to be way, way too long. A lot of the book simply reinforces the Scarlett character and, for me, she could have left out quite a bit of it without losing much. When you love a book, it can't be too long so I expect your view of the book's length will depend on how much you're enjoying it.If I could have forgotten the attitudes expressed towards slavery then I would have given this a higher rating. I couldn't manage to do it though. There are many books with accurate depictions of slavery and the attitude of whites towards slaves and they are very powerful. I think the character that bothers me the most is Rhett Butler. He is a smart, dashing scoundrel who loves Scarlett and is the only one who really knows her nature. He is also a character who admittedly shot a n----r for getting uppity with a white. I realize it was written in the 1930s and described a violent time but I still had some difficulty with it.The book is loaded with memorable quotes and it is a classic with larger than life characters that people love.So, I expect many readers will continue to love this book and I don't begrudge them that but I just couldn't get past certain things. The 3 star rating is almost an abstention regarding whether I recommend it.",
            "Gone With The Wind is timeless. Though the movie gives an overview of the book, there is so much more that is revealed in the book. It reveals much more about each character; it gives a background about Tara and its acquistion; it gives more insight into the relationships between the characters. The historical era is described so that the reader can understand the southern culture of that time. I have read the book at least 5 times, and each time I get something new from the book.",
            "The book was so much better than the movie. One of my new favorite books, will read over and over.",
            "I remember seeing this film about 40 years ago in Las Vegas. It was showing at the Las Vegas Cinerama next to the old Bonanza Hotel. It took me a couple weeks to read this book, but I really enjoyed it. Mitchell's depiction of the South after Civil War was very accurate as some of my family was from Arkansas and Mississippi so I have some idea of what that mindset was. This is a book that I will probably read i again sometime. I also found that ordering a used book through other dealers via Amazon was very effective and very easy. I will certainly use this service again.",
            "My sister recommended this book to me, saying that \"it was the best book she has ever read\". I knew that this book was amazing, judging from what my family has told me for so long, but I didn't want to read it for one reason that reason being, \"the book is over 1000 pages!!!\" So it's been lying on my shelf for more than a few years until I finally decided to read it. It took me 2 weeks to read (whereas it took my sister 5 days) it and boy, did I have an amazing time reading about Scarlett, her family, Tara, Captain Rhett Butler, Ashley Wilkes, and every body. I especially enjoyed the Southerners points of view about slavery. After readin historical books, all from the Union's point of view, I realized that I've been missing out on a lot of info on the Civil War. I've always thought that Southerners treated their slaves with cruelty, based on what I've read from other histocial fiction books, but after reading this one, I found out that slavery wasn't all about whippings, beatings, and any other kind is mismanagement.Scarlett has to be my favorite character. She is headstrong and stubborn, yes, but she fights for what she believes in and does everything to save Tara, even if it meant hurting family members. This books was dramatic, however, such as whatever someone gained, someone else loses something that is very dear to them but I guess that adds more \"zest\" to the whole story.This is, \"the best book I have ever read in my life\". Well at least in my 14 years of living. If you have the slightest interest in reading this wonderful, enchanting classic, go ahead. I did and I don't regret it.",
            "A true American classic, Gone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell is a must read for anyone who likes a good story about survival, betrayal, love, and historical fiction. Set in the Old South before, during, and after the Civil War, Scarlett O'Hara must grow up, leave her comfort zone and survive numerous hardships. Although the movie has caught the essence of the book, actually reading this novel is a must for every independent woman in America.",
            "I first read Gone with the Wind when I was in high school. I was 16 and didn't care much about anything, but this book grabbed my attention and held it. I had grown up in an old and established family from the South and had heard all the tales of the horrors of the 'time of our most recent unpleasantness', but Margret Michell's book brought those times to life. Yes, I know what people say about Mitchell and this book, but what was is. You can't change history just because you don't like it. I didn't and don't like a lot of my ancestor's choices, either, but it's there just the same.Anyhow, from the journals I've read (and I've now read lots of them) and my own personal history passed down from word of mouth, I think Ms. Mitchell did a good job of capturing a bygone era. In a word, I'm as captivated by this book in my older years as I was at 16. The book lives.",
            "There are good reasons why Gone With The Wind, published 73 years ago, is a classic among classics, a Pulitzer Prize winner, and has sold over 28 million copies in more than 37 countries. The reasons are that it is an unparalleled monumental epic of the American South that is very rich in historical facts, it has superbly developed unforgettable characters, a narrarative that is so captivating that the reader will feel he/she is right there experiencing all that was going on, and it truly stands the test of time. I enjoyed reading it at least as much now (and possibly more) than when I first read it over 45 years ago. While Gone With The Wind is often marketed as \"the greatest love story of our time,\" it is so much more than that. If you haven't read Gone With The Wind or haven't done so in many years, do yourself a tremendous favor and read it/read it again as soon as possible. It's an experience you'll savor for years to come.",
            "I can understand why Gone with the wind has been considered as a classic. This is Margaret Mitchelle's unforgettable tale of love and hate, gain and lost, life and death, of a nation divided, of the American people being torn apart by the civil war. This is the story of honourable but weak Ashley Wilkes, who lives in his own world, of Melanie Wilkes, who is no less than an angel, of the Fontaines, the Tarletons, the O'Haras and many other Geogians. This is the story of the black and white Southerners before, during, and after the war. Above all, it is the story of Captain Rhett Butler and the beautiful, determined, strong-willed but ignorant and ruthless Scarlett O'Hara.Gone with the wind is an outstanding read!",
            "Five stars is not enough to rate this timeless, flawless epic novel of the South. Miss Mitchell's talent has never been underrated or under-appreciated, but having read it as a teen - then, again recently, after having read \"Rhett Butler's People,\" the authorized sequel to GWTW commissioned by the Mitchell estate, I am newly appreciative of Miss Mitchell's prodigious talent.For those who have only seen the equally terrific, but different, movie, please read Mitchell's original.The movie does stand on its own. I am a fan of novels-turned-books and have seen many. I never denigrate a movie if it differed from the original novel in any way. The two are different media.But Mitchell's only novel earned her a place forever in American literature and is desrving to be read in its entirety.Though long, it is a quick read for the engaged reader.I have not read the much-ballyhooed but often best-seller, unauthorized sequels, but I will do so, mostly out of curiosity.The authorized sequel, Rhett Butler's People, is also interesting, but can never live up to Mitchell's GWTW.",
            "I read this book as a teenager and have absolutely loved it ever since. The descriptive quality of writing that Margaret Mitchell utilizes brings the story and its characters to life. It gives an good glimpse of the state of affairs in the antebellum and postbellum South.I've read this on several occasions, and each time I get just as much enjoyment as I did the first! Excellent!",
            "Gone with the Wind is one of the rare stories that delivers exactly what you wouldn't expect. Nothing about it is predictable, nothing is cliche. The heroine is infintely less of a heroine than ever before - she's Scarlett, the spoiled, selfish Southern daughter of a plantation owner, used to having everything handed to her on a silver platter. During the period of the Civil War, she is forced to grow up and become a woman, but she never loses childish inclinations to selfishness and pettiness.Enter Rhett Butler, the conceited, vulgar 'Yankee' whom Scarlett despises and yet, is fascinated by. Though he is not quite a hero as Scarlett is not a heroine, he has become one of America's most beloved leading men.Gone with the Wind is startling in its storyline and realism, and does not gloss over the brutality and harsh outcomings of the Civil War - on both sides.I purchased my copy of Gone with the Wind at a library. The book had not been used by the library, but donated and then put for sale. I paid $3 for it - in very good condition. It was a 40th Anniversary Edition complete with slipcase. It is positively beautiful, and I could not have gotten a better bargain. Aside from some mild use and wear, and a name written in pencil on the first page, its in perfect condition. An excellent copy - I read it over and over.",
            "Love in the time of war! You can't beat it. The first time I read this book I was interested in the love story. When I read it again, I was mesmerized with the portrait of a time and place which have been erased from our collection memory by layers of political correctness. This paperback edition is lovely, by the way, and it doesn't break apart the way some big paperbacks can.",
            "I first read this book when I was a teenager. It has never lost its appeal to me. This epic saga emcompasses all of the major elements -- love, war, history, and memorable characters -- particularly the charismatic, witchy heroine Scarlett O'Hara and her male counterpart, Rhett Butler. Starting when Scarlett was sixteen, and the belle of the county, with dozens of beaus, she quickly moves with the times when war sweeps the antebellum South. In love with bookish, sensitive Ashley, she sees him off to the Civil War while marrying someone else, just because Ashley married someone else. She is quickly widowed, and journeys to Atlanta to stay with relatives. She has her eye on Rhett Butler, a stockade captain who plans to make money out of \"the fall of a civilization.\" For everything about the old life is being swept away in war -- \"cotton, slaves, and arrogance.\" Over the course of the novel, she slowly discovers who she truly loves, and goes for him. But he is too proud to reveal his true feelings for her, as she stubbornly clings to another man. Saving her plantation home from carpetbaggers, she decides to marry Rhett. It takes two tragedies for her to find out who has been saving her as a damsel in distress all of these years, and that he \"loves her to distraction.\" The novel is full of truths and themes that coincide again and again -- love triangles, the fall of an era and who survives the times in style, and friendship, family, and true love.",
            "Gone With the Wind was a fantastic book. It's about this young woman, Scarlett O'Hara, who is living during the Civil War-in the south. Her rich and perfect life is ruined once the south loses the war and she is thrown into a time of starvation and misery. She becomes a widow and has to face those troubles as well.Mitchell created the character, Scarlett, wonderfully. She had spunk, determination, intelligence, and selfishness-traits that made her personality interesting. She does what ever she needs to get her by. Then there's Rhett. He's this dashing man who is no gentleman. I have to say, he brought a little bit of light into the dark parts of the book. He seems to be just a rude, mischevious man at first, but later on, Mitchell makes his character more full, shall I say. His character is deep and full of emotion and feelings-I really can't describe it.Then Margaret Mitchell created a bond and passion between these two characters. It was a wonderful romance, with love and anger-a sort of bittersweet romance. I felt I could connect with these characters.I loved this novel; I couldn't put it down. I read it at a young age, 11 to be exact, but I was into it none the less. It kept me hooked for 7 weeks until I finally finished it. It's long-really long-but absolutely worth it. I loved it, loved it, loved it! This book tied together historical fiction and romance, my favorite types of books, into one novel. It is a book not to be forgotten-ever.",
            "I bought this as a Christmas present for my mother. She has loved \"Gone With the Wind\" for decades, and I can remember sitting and watching it with her, when we only had one television. This particular book was nothing like the edition I bought her years ago, but it was lost in a long distance move, and I've never found another one like it. This copy takes it's place admirably.",
            "Definately not what I was expecting! I thought this would be one of those book where the characters fall head over heels in love. The romance was developed much more slowly, but was fitting with the plot.The novel is long, but very well-written. It will take you back to the late 19th century and give you a feel for what it was like to live in that time.I wasn't crazy about the ending, as I wished it would be happier, and left me wishing more had been written. I suppose the real ending was meant to be guessed.If you're looking for a good read and you don't mind if it takes some time, I would highly reccomend this book. Truly a classic!",
            "No, I had never read it. My knowledge of it came from the movie. A dear family member was re-reading it, and when I said I never had, she told me it was a must read. I didn't see why, but on her advice, I bought it and read, cover to cover. It is so much better than just the movie. The history of the South and the changes to life the war brought are incredible. Yes, I agree, it is a must read.",
            "First of all, the book is fantastic! Second of all, I could not ask for it to be in better condition! Even being shipped up to Alaska it came in great time and in great condition. I would recommend this book to everyone!",
            "I have read this book several times and it never dissappoints. The main characters; Scarlett, Rhett, Melanie, Ashley, Mammy along with others to numerous to mention are vivid in the minds eye. You are swept up by the turmoil the South suffered during the Civil War and Reconstruction. Ultimately, it is the love story of all time. A must read!",
            "This book is a true classic. The horrors of the civil war and learning how to live after the defeat and destruction of a culture have been brought to life in a spectacular way. Its unusual in the fact the main character is easy to dislike yet an honest look at flawed human character gains a respect for her. Almost every aspect of the human condition are encountered here within the pages. The movie version while enjoyable lacks the depth of characters and completely omits some characters. Highly recommended!",
            "A classic, I couldn't wait to download this to my Kindle. There is everything you could hope and dream of in this book. Scarlett is so complicated, yet real. My all time favorite book.",
            "The first time I read this Pulitzer winner was when I was in high school. The movie had just been re-released and my best friend and I saw it about 8 times. She still had the best plot description I've ever heard: \"This is the story of Rhett Butler who loves Scarlett O'Hara, who loves Ashley Wilkes, who loves Melanie Hamilton, who loves everyone, including the town tart Belle Watling, who loves Rhett Butler, who loves Scarlett...\"I've since read the book a second and now a third time and recognize more depth than our first summary. Yes, it is still a love story. But it is also a quintessential Southern book, a quintessential great American novel, a quintessential exploration of war and its aftermath, and a quintessential character study of Scarlett O'Hara's evolution from spoiled girl to unstoppable woman.Mitchell has crafted a 1000-page book that reads like a short novel. The characters who people her book present the full spectrum of human traits, from best to worst. These are the qualities that make the book such an enduring favorite, and really a classic work of literature.Is the book without flaws? Of course not. I cringe at the romantic version of the Ku Klux Klan. I am appalled at how often she compares the \"darkies\" to children or, worse yet, apes. But I am still caught up in the story, and that is the reason most people read novels - for a good story. And it was the story that first captured my attention and my heart, and it is the story that still earns it 5 stars.Linda Stephens does a fine job of narrating the audio version, though I thought her Scarlett sounded too mature at the beginning of the book - Scarlett is only 16 when we first meet her, and I thought her voice should have a higher pitch.",

            "Gone With the WindBy Margaret MitchellGone with the Wind was first published in May, 1936, and won the Pulitzer Prize in 1937; the novel linearly chronicles the enchanting and lyrical Old South, the brutal ravages of the Civil War upon the South and the subsequent struggle for reconstruction. Moreover, Gone With the Wind tells the tale of the strong-willed, crafty and determined, Katie \"Scarlett\" O'Hara; one of the most famous female characters in literature (and film - due to the 1939 movie of the same name).The book is a significant read, it was originally published at 1037 pages and now finishes at 1024. But it is well-worth the effort to pour your heart and time into this romantic, courageous and historical novel. If in doubt, consider the fact that it sold $176,000 copies within the first few weeks (at an unprecedented $3 apiece), and has gone on to sell over 30 million copies. Scarlett is considered by many to be the most intriguing female character ever written, and the novel typically tops the \"Most Romantic\" books lists. It took author, Margaret Mitchell, over seven years to write the story and it is the only book she ever published.The story is set in Atlanta, Georgia. Scarlett, the daughter of a wealthy Irish plantation owner, has made up her mind that she is in love with the charming and chivalrous Ashley Wilkes. However, Ashley has committed to marrying his gracious and even-tempered cousin, Melanie Hamilton. Their marriage puts high-minded Scarlett into a lifelong tailspin of ill-fated marriages and emotional conflict. In the meantime, she has the roguish, handsome and financially secure Rhett Butler in the wings for most of the story and eventually marries him but this proves equally tumultuous and ruinous for both of them.This is not a straight-forward love story; rather it is a assortment box of every type of human love imaginable. There is love for one's heritage (the Old South), land (the great Tara Plantation), children (she has four pregnancies), parents (who die), spouses (she has three) lovers, friends, and foes. This is also the story of strength, struggle, and self-realization. It is only at the end of the novel that Scarlett is finally able to distinguish and reconcile the difference between real love and starry-eyed infatuation.The spirited and intrepid Scarlett gives this epic novel wings to soar for over a thousand pages. She is a plucky character who approaches life with the resilience of a determined adventurer. Her intelligent, hard-working, go-getter attitude gives the story backbone, but it is her loves, longings and grievous losses that give it substance. Ultimately, it is her uncompromising ability to fight for herself, and for those she loves, that makes her the heroine of the novel and of the hearts of those who read it.Beth Walz[...]",

The word to describe this masterpeice has not been created because nothing till its puplication could have deserved it. I often find myself tring to react to situations in the manner that I think my beloved romodel would have. I have built dreams around this book! I plan to move to the south and live happily knowing it was the base for such workmanship!! I Love The Book!!",
            "I hesitated in reading Gone With the Wind, thinking it would be boring and long. It is long, but definitely not boring. I loved all of the characters -- each with their distinct personalities, strengths and weaknesses. I couldn't put the book down. The film does not even capture one tenth of the gloriousness of Margaret Mitchell's words.",
            "I loved this book. It couldn't have been better. I think that Alexandra Ripley (who wrote Scarlett:The sequel . . .) was wrong to try and &quot;fix&quot; GWTW. It can't be fixed. She didn't realize that Rhett's and Scarlett's relationship couldn't be fixed. GWTW was perfect, and I think Scarlett was cool even if she was spoiled. She's very pretty in the movie. =)",
            "This is by far the best book I have ever read. It is the epitimy of what a love story should be. My favorite character from the book is of course, Scarlett O'Hara, because of her passion for life and her southern charm. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone.",
            "Gone with the wind is the best and most unbelievable book I've ever read. It has so much going on and the characters are so interesting you are drawn to them and their lives. Despite the fact that the book is over a thousand pages, I was sorry when it was over! It was amazing.",
            "I think this book was a wonderful story and very, very well written. The author did a great job of descibing every detail right down to the size of Scarlett's dress. From the moment Scarlett O'Hara met Rhett Butler to the last page the story was filled with excitement, joy, and sorrow. This is the best book I have ever read and I would reccommend it to everyone",
            "The atory is written through Scarlets eyes . It tells of a spoilled southern Belle's life when the war begins and after it ends. While reading the book you also get a feel for the changes that the south went through. while Scarlet is defenatly a girl with spirt she is also a selfish mule. In Mammy's words &quot;a mule with a hores harness. I would defenatly say that the book is written for anyone with any heart at all.",
            "No matter where I am or what i do, GWTW is the most amazing book I have read since The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Ms Mitchell is an artist painting for us what Tara and Atlanta are like. She sculpts for us the flavors of the characters and has a certain way of stimulating all of your senses at once. You can taste, see, hear, smell, and almost feel the world that has been created. Not many authors successfully pull this off here in this world of TV and Movies where it is all right there for you and you don't actually have to think about it.",

I started to read the book, thinking that I would hate it. But as the story line progressed, it grew on me more and more. I was enthralled with the strength and courage that Scarlett had. This book was way better than I thought it would be. But the ending, which made me cry, dissapointed me. And I threw a fit because I read such a long story with such a horrible ending. But I now realize that I was just too young to read this book in 7th grade. I'm in 8th grade now and maybe sometime soon I'll read it again and understand it better. After you read this book the story will stay in your mind forever. My favorite character, strangely enough, was Rene Picard.",
            "I started to read the story a month before its realease to the theaters on june 26 (my birhtday)and I just fell in love with scarlett and the story being 15 now.I just finished it 2 days ago and that must be the best book I have ever read I think i'll read it again in the future,I would defenitly recomend it to anyone.",
            "Having seen the movie more times than I can count, I decided to read the book. I can only say that the book was not a disappointment. Scarlett O'Hara is the kind of character that you hate one minute and love the next. I was inspired by her determination to survive, but shocked at the schemes she came up with. While the book may be rather long, you won't be able to put it down once you start it.",
            "GWTW is, by far, the greatest romantic piece of historical literature ever published. It takes into account the psychological drama of an egotistical teenage girl coming of age as her world falls apart. Scarlett is portrayed with many imperfections (just as we all have), but in the end she sees the error of her ways. It is an American classic because of its representation of our societies obssession with self, and I believe everyone can see at least a piece of themselves in her, which is what makes the story so compelling. I read it for the first time at the age of 13, and 12 years later it continues to stand as the greatest novel ever written in my mind. I recommend it to anyone interested in analyzing a seemingly bad character and finding the reason behind their actions.",
            "Gone with the Wind was truly the best novel I have ever read and by far my favorite. Margaret Mitchell described every little detail so one could see it vividly, even if it was only in one's imagination. The characters were very much like real people and that is something not all author's are able to accomplish. The sequel, although it was a good effort, could not compare to the original. I think Gone with the Wind is a novel that everyone should read. If you haven't already read GWTW, then you don't know what you are missing. :-) :-)",
            "This book is incredible in every way! When I read it the first time, I became obsessed and was transported back to that era. I thought about it so much that even now, over 3 years later, when I read any part of it, I feels so familiar, a little like coming home. As large as the novel is, you won't regret a single moment you spend reading it. I recomend Gone with the Wind to anyone, especially anyone who loves to be transported to another time and place!",
            "Every time I read this novel, it makes me stop and think how there could be so few genuinley talented people on this earth, with someone like Ms. Mitchell to set such a fine example. Her ability to make the characters jump out from the pages is astounding. Her description of raw, human emotion move Scarlett from haughty, capricious and naive, to indignant, through livid and past loquaciously melancholy. This novel is unforgettably and extraodinarily real, penetrating, and poignant. And as for the sequel, A.R.'s 'Scarlett', I think it was great. Obviously not as good as the original, but the effort was recognized and well noted. (I hope that doesn't in any way sound patronizing). I recommend both novels to all ages, and regardless of what type of books you usually like to read. Guaranteed, you will love it!",
            "I am thirteen, and have just graduated 7th grade. I have read Gone with the Wind twice in the past year. I do believe it is the best novel I have read or ever will read. The first time I read Gone with the Wind, it took me four days to read. (the complete unabridged version). I did not spend all day reading it because I was in Kyoto, Japan siteseeing. The second time I was in school and had homework and other things to do so it took me a week to read it again. I also have read Scarlett it also was very good, but not as good as the original. If you haven't read it yet give Gone with the Wind a try!",
            "When i was reading this book, i thought about it and its characters day and night. I even dreamt about them! Thats how good it is! While reading it, it seems as if you are transported to that era and the characters are there in front of you. It is an immortal novel and people of all ages will continue enjoying it. Even those like me, who are not Americans will enjoy it because it is a novel for all nations. Every nation passes through a revolution or massive change atleast once in its history which turns the structure of its society upside down as shown in this novel. All the emotions portrayed so beautifully in this novel like love, hate, determination, a will to fight and struggle are universal. Without any doubt, this novel is the best that i've ever read.",
            "I first watched the movie when I'm 14. Just totally obsessed by it and started to read the novel. I'm now 17 and had read the novel 3 times in Chinese and one time in English and watched the movie for 5 times. It is (will be) the best novel I had read... the novel is better than the movie, more better. Dont' read or watch the sequel!! You will disappointed. Scarlet and Rhett only live in Gone With The Wind. When it ask &quot; How do you rate this book?&quot; in this review. I just can't stop laughing. Can it be rated by stars?",
            "Margret Mitchell uses wonderful descriptions to show a way of life that has long disappeared from time. The characters are fantastic and the conflicts in the book are numerous: Scarlett's love for Ashley, Rhett's love for Scarlett, the plight to salvage a lost cause. I saw the book as more than a love story. It shows the many emotions people go through as they mature and change with the world they are presented with. Gone With the Wind should be a required book for anyone who enjoys this genre. The movie is also good, but it doesn't include everything the book has to offer. I laughed and cried, and even though it's long (around 1,000 pages), I loved every moment, and wished it were longer. (It got really good at the end and then it ended)",
            "I could go on and on about how good the book is like everyone else does. I am not it is without a doubt the best novel ever. even if you do not like the Civil War the love story sweeps you for decades and decades to come",
            "GWTW has been my favorite book for a very long time. I just turned fourteen and I read it in fifth grade. For as long as I could remember, my sister had been talking about this book and how it had altered her opinion on classic literature. So, in fifth grade, i saw the movie, adored it got a hold of the book and read it to the very end. Even now, my parents remark about my &quot;Gone With the Wind Period&quot; when I thought of nothing but GWTW and read everything I could on the subject. I ordered cards, I got the script to the movie, I even read the biographys, letters and pictures of Margaret Mitchell. It's a awsome movie, a brilliant novel, and, to sum things up, probably the most influential book/movie of my childhood, it helped make me into the person I am today.---Cynthia Christina Vanci",
            "I am only twelve years old, and most people my age aren't at all interested in love stories. I am always interested in a good book, and most of my picks are action or mystery. I have read hundreds of books in my life so far, some of them poorly written, some of them average, but many of them incredible. These books have captured my imagination, but Gone With the Wind took my soul. I almost made a new lake out of my tears when Melanie died. And I loved Mammy! She added some of the funniest parts to a book I have ever had the honor to read. I am still wondering how she'll ever get Rhett back after what happened. I haven't read the sequal yet but I intend to do so. In fact, I am trying to order it from Amazon.com as soon as possible. I don't care if dozens of people didn't like the sequal. I HAVE GOT TO KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT IN THE STORY! That's also one of GWTW's strong points. Most people won't read more than the first chapter, but if you decide to go the extra mile (or two) you will find yourself dodging bullets in Sherman's seige of Atlanta. If there is one weakness to it, it's in the movie itself. It followed closely to the story line, but strangely the guys making it forgot about little Wade and Ella, and almost forgot Will entirely. But even worse, they got Mr. O'hara's death completely mixed up. And some of the guys that they got to play the beaux didn't know the first thing about acting. Charles Hamilton may have been an idiot, but surely he wasn't that dumb! Sorry, I'm getting to into the movie (I just finished watching it for the first time today). Still, despite the movie's sad mistakes, Gone With the Wind has swept this twelve year old boy off is feet and into the civil war in Atlanta! This isn't a rental book. This is a buying book",
            "Being raised in the south myself, I feel a kinship to Scarlett O'Hara. Margaret Mitchell's book has keep me captivated since I was a child. GWTW was one of the first book reports I gave in jr. high school. The teacher couldn't believe that someone of my age could have read such a book. Although it took close to a week to read it, GWTW has stayed in my mind and heart in all the years that have followed. No book has made the impression that this one has made on me. I don't believe there is one that could. The first copy of this book I ever got has long since had the ink rubbed from its pages. It was well worth the time that is takes to read it. It is TRULY a classic",
            "I have read this many times, and love it better every time. Rhett Butler was my first love ever, thanks to Margaret Mitchell. I still have a little crush on him. She made the characters so real that I feel like I grew up knowing them as my friends",
            "How do you rate a work of art? By the amount of people who have fallen under its spell? Or by the amount of hours one spends reading it, and then reviewing it? Gone with the wind has already been rated a ten, and its flame has not diminished an iota. I am fifteen, and I have yet to read a book which portrays civil war, and love, as well as Margaret Mitchell does in Gone with the Wind. I am fifteen, and I have yet to love a heroine as much as I love Scarlett O' Hara. Melanie is good, but Scarlett is alive! Her spirit and unflagging determination awakens in all of us the right to survive. We all need reminders of the horrors of war, and of the fact that while mostly the men go off to war, it is the woman who has to stay home and somehow make do with only the bare essentials of life, and hope...........................I recommend everyone to read this book, it is the best!",
            "Gone with the Wind was the fisrt 'adult' book I'd ever read as a child .Took me awhile to get thru it but I'v read it many times since then. It was MY daughters first 'adult' book and has become her favorite also. I hope that my grandaughter also loves this book when she comes to be",
            "Margaret Michell's GONE WITH THE WIND is a tragic saga that can never be forgotten once read. Scarlett O'Hara is headstrong, intelligent, bold, and beautiful but she also makes mistakes. She is selfish and lives for the present. Rett Buttler is one man no woman can ever forget. He is the perfect father and lover whom is first consumed wholly with Scarlett and then driven away by her. Scarlett's frivolousness will be turned over and over in your mind. If you want to read a truely absorbing, romantic, historically accurate book let this one be your first choice",
            "It takes you through the story of a girl that has everything and wants just what she can't have, and through the story of how her world fell around her. About Scarlett and her men, but never having her one love",
            "Gone with the Wind's anti-hero is captivating and complex. Scarlett is complex in her own mind, tormented about what she wants vs what's right to do, while she fights to survive during and after the Civil War. She is selfish and aware of it. Adding to the complexity of Scarlett, is her kindness that she affords others despite her selfish desire. While she is the daughter of a slave holder, she remains loyal to caring for her former slaves after the war and has a developed relationship with Mammy. Unfortunately, the social thread of America, and much of the world from Bible days going forward, thought nothing wrong of owning slaves. However, that social paradigm shifts as the story continues. Scarlett might be from a wealthy family, but she is still a female that bucks societal trends and owns and operates business. On occasion she is outright ruthless with men. In the end of the book she is \"punished\" for her misdeeds. However, her husband is not.It surprises me that many people compare GWTW to Birth of a Nation. The problem is we are viewing GWTW as if it can be held to today's value system. It does not. It cannot. It's not a book about human unity or human dignity. It's a book about surviving crisis and how some American's got through a war that killed 12% of the US population. In the 1920s and 30s the KKK was very strong in the South and perpetuated stories about black attacks on whites and many political groups argued that blacks were not fit for society. Using genteel approaches GWTW presents strong women who helped the south survive the war, it also showed blacks as \"southerners\" and caring people (Scarlett's life is saved at least twice by a black character in the book), it also suggests that war is not a wise solution. Scarlett gets away with voicing unpopular opinions \"war is a waste of time\", \"the south should just free the slaves\", \"why should women always stay quiet around men?\" because she's portrayed as an anti-hero. If she were a do-gooder she might come off differently. Pretend she had Melanie's \"kind nature\" combined with her practical and self serving criticism of \"states rights, sexism, & war\", she would be seen by many readers in the 1930s as almost being an abolitionist sympathizer. The book would have failed at that point in delivering it's message about survival. The message would be lost. Furthermore, it wouldn't express what many southerners already felt, a kinship and love of the land. When you read the last paragraph of the book you get a picture of what prevails in the south, the love of the earth, southern life, quiet country evenings and the simple relationship of Scarlett and Mammy (the only person she has left: her father and mother died, her friend Melanie died, daughter died and her husband left). Scarlett also realizes too late that she is in love with Rhett and losses him, just as the South realized too late that \"states rights\" cost them what they loved the most.",
            "Atlanta, Georgia- No other book has defined the south more than Gone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell. Growing up in the south, I deemed it was time to sit down and read this classic which is in celebrating seventy five years in print.In the 75th Anniversary addition, Pat Conroy write a preface where he chronicles how this book was a bond between he and his mother as she would read it to him and how it profoundly influenced his writings.With over a 900 pages, it is a brick of a book but it does masterfully captures the consequences of what we refer in the south as \"the war of northern aggression\".The principle character Scarlett evolves from a young women ready to be conquered by a wide array of suitors. Her love Ashley has been wooed away and she spends a lifetime trying to pave her way. The allusive Rhett Butler fails to conquer this steel magnolia who always keeps hope alive by reiterating that tomorrow is a new day.Gone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell takes you to the allure of the gentile world of the south. This book should be savored by any book lover once in their reading odyssey.",

            "GWTW is, hands down, the greatest American novel. In my opinion, it is the greatest novel ever written. When I first read GWTW, I couldn't wait to get to the parts about Scarlett and Rhett. Now, though I still love the interplay between them, I read it for the incredible detail to history. Margaret Mitchell grew up sitting on the knees of old confederate soldiers while they reminisced about the war, then took that treasure and masterfully provided a moving account of the war and it's aftermath through the eyes of Scarlett O'Hara. The wonderful thing is that she is able to give this history lesson all wrapped up in the greatest love story of all times! All the characters are memorable - Mammy, Gerald O'Hara, Ashley, Melanie, not to mention the near-perfect man, Rhett Butler! And then there is Scarlett... While many people who have only seen the movie don't like Scarlett, no one who reads the book can help but admire her sheer determination to overcome the tragedy of the war and rebuild her life. At the same time, it is heart wrenching to see her throwing away the love of her true soul mate and ruining her life because of the fears the war sprouted in her. I admire Scarlett on many levels, and think she is the most vivid heroine in literature because of her failings and her strength. If you could capture Scarlett's fire and Melanie's kindness and roll them into one woman, she could rule the world and be adored by all. If you want a book that will grab your heart and capture your emotions, you must read Gone With The Wind!",
            "I have read this book three times and each time it gets better and better. Our book group enjoyed it too.",
            "this book has endured the many years because it is so well written...yes, we all know the story by heart, and have seen the movie (probably SEVERAL times..) but what a great read! truly a 20th century \"romeo and juliet\"!",

It is about a southern belle and how the Civil War changed her life. It is about her determination and how she made it through no matter what. :) :) :) Read it for yourself and see!",
            "Long book, and it hurts your eyes to read it, but it is well worth reading. So often we hear of the north's view of the war, and now we see it through the strong southern belle, Scarlett. Scarlett isn't nice, in fact she's very down to earth and reflects the flaws as well as the compliments women today share. She is spirited and willing to risk it all to never go hungry again, after feeling the poverty and hunger once Sherman swept through. Unlike many southerners, she realized that the past is gone with the Wind and she must break ties with society in order to stay strong, alive, and comfortable.",

It's amazing and a person can connect with one of the character immediatly. Scarlett is the one, who is vain, and likes to get her way with everything. Rhett is a great guy... just that his love dies out for Scarlett in the end. the funniest character i consider to be is Mammy. A book that should be in everyone's library.",
            "Scarlett O'Hara is born to an Irish father and Southern belle mother in 1840's Georgia. Pampered all her life, Scarlett pursues the love of Ashley Wilkes, only to be rebuffed. Wounded, she seeks to hurt him by marrying his fiance's brother, Charles Hamilton. When Charles dies in a military camp, Scarlett moves to Atlanta to live with Ashley's wife, Melanie, who doesn't know that Scarlett loves her husband.Rhett Butler, a dashing scoundrel, meets Scarlett for the first time just as she has revealed her love for Ashley. Knowing that a 'true lady' would never have done such a thing, Rhett recognizes the scoundrel in Scarlett and is immediately attracted to her. Throughout his exploits as a blockade runner, he pursues Scarlett while she pines fruitlessly for Ashley.Set against the swirling backdrop of the Civil War, Gone With the Wind is meticulously researched and exceedingly well written. Descriptions of upper class, white, Southern life are fascinating, and the plot is, of course, wildly compelling. Will Ashley leave his wife for Scarlett? Will Rhett reveal his love for Scarlett? Will Scarlett return Rhett's love? How do they survive the great toll the Civil War takes on their lives? A classic page-turner.",
            "\"Gone with the Wind\" - Book ReviewThis is a story of love, of loss, and of courage. Margaret Mitchell created an amazing story, romance saga of love and the most sentimental portrait of the Civil War. \"Gone with the Wind\" in my opinion is deserving of a five-star rating, because it is by far the greatest story ever written. Mitchell's \"Gone with the Wind\" is the story of Scarlett O'Hara, a spoiled southern beautiful woman, whose life is suddenly caught up in the turmoil of the American Civil War. Through her fights during the war and the six years of Reconstruction that follow, author showed her life pass through three husbands and three children. Within this background, we observe Scarlett's conflict against external and internal conflicts, her losses, gains, and hopes. Author described bright vivid characters and relationship between people, but she did not attach great importance to some problem, such as slavery; the book is very interesting and I certainly would recommend it to just about anyone.\"Gone with the Wind\" by Margaret Mitchell is a war novel, a historical romance, a comedy of manners, a bitter lamentation, a cry of the heart, and a long, cold-hearted look at the character of this one lovely woman. It is undoubtedly the classic novel of Civil War. The major characteristic that enables it to achieve its seriousness also criticizes Scarlett O'Hara to a life of unrequited love and dooms her potential for happiness with Rhett Butler. Mitchell created the character, Scarlett, wonderfully. She had spunk, determination, intelligence, and selfishness-traits that made her personality interesting. If Scarlett needs something bad enough, she will not hesitate to throw away proper social conduct or her own personal goals. She does what ever she needs to get her by. Then there is Rhett. He is this attractive man who is no gentleman. He brought a little bit of light into the dark parts of the book. He seems to be just a rude, ill-behaved man at first, but later his character is deep and full of emotion and feelings. Margaret Mitchell created a bond and passion between these two characters. It was a wonderful romance, with love and anger-a sort of bittersweet romance. Although Scarlett is a strong and independent woman, most people can relate to her because she makes mistakes like a normal human. This book examines different types of strength. Whether it is Mammy's honorable courage and dignity, or Rhett's keen level-headedness, or Melanie's Christian devotion to people, each person has his or her own root from which they draw their strength.The perspective is strength because it permits the author to vividly portray the destruction of Southern society better than any battlefield-centered novel could. Unfortunately, it also leaves the author, and therefore Scarlet as well, incapable of understanding the male characters. They are merely personalities that fade in-and-out of the background to shape the narrative. While they are characters that can stand up off the page and cast a shadow, there is no tone or timbre in their images. Some author's descriptions of the reconstruction are degraded. For example, blacks were only happy being slaves. Big Sam says he had enough of freedom and wants to go back to Tara. He even states doubtfully that while in the north whites wanted him to sit at the table like he was their equal, but he could not do it because he is not the equal to whites. At one point Mitchell is describing how the southern whites hate the Yankees so much because the Yankees have money and food and power and they do not, yet she does not have any sense of irony to see that the whites are in the position that they put the slaves in for centuries.If someone loves historical fiction with a little romance, this book is perfect for their. The writing is superb, and the plot is dramatic and sad, but it includes enough of Scarlett's triumphs of strength that sets it apart from all other books. Scarlett O'Hara is the perfect Southern belle who is incredible to read about. How she attracts men with her charm and little helpless acts is unbelievable. She is used to having slaves serve her and she treats them with little or no respect until she needs them. One cannot stop thinking about how much they would hate Scarlet if she was real, but they are not able to stop feeling sorry for her and they want to help her to realize how stupid she is. This is a must read for any person who loves classic literature.\"Gone with the Wind\" is really one of the world's most well written romance novels. Set in the backdrop of the American Civil War in the eighteen century, it tells the story of the people who fought for survival during the War and the Reconstruction Period through sheer shrewd wits and cunning business methods. Margaret Mitchell is an absolute talent. She was nowhere close to the cheap romance writer many had portrayed her to be- she was a realist. She was actually writing about how human spirit and determination, how it can be applied to help one over such obstacles. Mitchell's book broke sales records. Within a year of publication, 1,383,000 copies had been sold. Today, sales stand at over 21,000,000. In 1937 \"Gone with the Wind\" was awarded the Pulitzer Prize.",
            "This is the first phrase in the book to describe the spoiled Scarlett O' Hara, who was made immoral by Viven Leigh in the movie verison of ' Gone with the Wind' ( 1939 ). The book is 1024 pages, which is long, but the book is so good, you wouldn't even realize how many pages there are, and you'll be asking for more.The story is about a spoiled Southern Belle named Scarlett O' Hara, who lives in Georgia on her family Plantion, and basically lives the life of a southern belle of her time ( mid-1800's ). Scarlett gets anything she wants, all she has to do is bat her eyelashes. But the one man she wants, Ashley Hamiltion, she can't give. No matter how hard she trys, she just can't get him, and to make matters worst. He's marrying the mousy-type Melanie. Scarlett than goes through the rest of the book, trying to get Ashley through revenge and through her love. Along the way, she meets the handsome Rhett Butler, the man who truly wants to be the only one for Scarlett, but knows he never can.If your fan of the movie ( like I am before I read the book ), then you would notice BIG differences between the two. But the book describes each character perfectly, Scarlett is even more interesting to read about. For movie fans, hearing Scarlett's thoughts is even more of a treat. I'll recommend this book to ANYONE.",
            "Margaret Mitchell was born in Atlanta in November 1900. When she was around thirteen, her family, affluent but not wealthy, moved into a big house on Peachtree Street, one of the principal settings for Gone with the Wind, which she began writing in 1926. The Macmillan Company published Gone with the Wind in May 1936; it won the Pulitzer Prize in 1937. The movie, which won ten Academy Awards, premiered in Atlantic City on December 15, 1939.I read the &#65533;Special Commemorative 60th-Anniversary Edition&#65533; (paperback) purchased from Amazon.com in February 2003, which commemorates the film, not the book. The back cover of that edition quotes the Washington Post claiming it&#65533;s &#65533;The greatest love story of our time, the story of Scarlett O&#65533;Hara and Rhett Butler&#65533;.&#65533; I suspect the person who wrote that saw the movie, but did not read the book. If it&#65533;s the love story that interests you, I suggest you buy the video. If you want to understand the origins of the South&#65533;s point of view though, at least the upper middle class Georgian point of view, then read this book.I was raised in Connecticut and have been often perplexed by the notions of some of my Southern white peers, puzzled for example by the intractable bigotry of intelligent people who are unwilling to understand that they ought to know better. Conversely, I&#65533;ve admired the generous, unselfish, seemingly pointless hospitality given me by a Southern adversary, a rival, so incongruent that it smacked of hypocrisy. Having read Gone with the Wind, I&#65533;m less perplexed and puzzled now. These people were bred on deep roots.Margaret Mitchell fashioned her novel from stories about slavery, the Civil War, reconstruction and abolition told by those who had survived those dramatic events. The people who lived through those terrible times, or their children, told those stories. From these tales, Margaret Mitchell painted a broad panorama of a culture in forced transformation: The brutal and reprehensible conduct of the Yankees, the greed of the carpetbaggers, the noble origins of the KKK, and the corruption of the North&#65533;s reconstruction. It is Southern noblesse telling the story of their decline. Margaret Mitchell is their apologist.The paperback version I read has 1024 pages of small type with narrow margins. Mitchell&#65533;s writing is sometimes exciting, but often it&#65533;s tedious. Descriptions tend to be excessive, and dialogue is often more like monologue. This style may have been fashionable fifty years ago, but I&#65533;ll deduct a star for it today.",
            "WOW~ There is barely enough words to describe how great it is, so I say, Thank You Margret Mitchell, for such a wonderful book. To say the least, I've read so much romance that I can literally guess what happens at the end of each novel (and Jane Austen counts) but this one is just fantastic. However I only gave it four stars because of1)how many man Scarlett has married-Charles, Frank, Rhett~2)I cannot give it four and a half starsI must say thought, to those who love this book, steer clear away from the supposed sequel: \"Scarlett: The Sequel to Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind\" or \"Rhett Butler's People\" It is just a horror to see such a great book have such a terrible sequel for an ending.Anyways, for those who have not yet read this book, HAPPY READING!",
            "What can I say? This one is a classic! A very good historical romance set in the south during and after the Civil War. I cannot help but love and hate Scarlett O'Hara, both for her feisty spirit, her stubborn disposition, and her passion for the unobtainable. If you've never read this book, you should.",
            "Yes, the book is racist, but let's cut Mitchell a little slack. She was a person of her place and time. There were no documentaries to compete with \"Birth of a Nation,\" no internet, and entire towns were segregated. Most white people never heard the other side of the story. Who is to say what Mitchell's attitudes would be today? Probably, like most of the country, she would have become much more thoughtful.While it's tough not to cringe at the casual use of the n-word and \"darky\" in the book, it is what Mitchell knew. Even sweet, precious Melanie decried going up north because her son would have to go to school with \"pickaninnies.\" Forgiving her for romanticizing a vile, inhuman system that degraded women of all colors, \"crackers,\" and black men is easy, because she knew little else. There is no excuse for the twits who swoon over the book and ignore inconvenient facts, because they know better (or should).It takes nothing away from the fact that Mitchell was an awesome writer who could bring characters and settings to life like nobody else. She and J. K. Rowling are about the only two writers who can keep me up reading at night when I have to go to work the next day.",
            "When I read the first sentence of \"Gone with the Wind\" I was forever hooked. The description of the glitz and glamour of Southern life, the odd perspective on the civil war, the turbulence of Rhett Butler's and Scarlett O'Hara's stormy relationship,it is all so well-crafted. The only reason why one might hesitate to read the book is, it was written by a Southener and you do have to endure insults hurled upon the \"darkies\". The good \"darkies\" are the ones that decide to stay with their masters, and it is very unrealistic in that sense. Other than that, it is worth reading. Two thumbs way, way up!",
            "This is the best book of all time it is a love story and a story about survival. Scarlett is both a villain and heroine",
            "This is a great book! I love it. You should read it. It took me one year to finish it.",
            "I never really considered reading this book before and I'd never seen the movie. I'd intended to, see the movie that is, but I'd never even thought about reading the book until a friend had it sitting around and wasn't reading it so I said \"what the heck, what's the drama all about?\".Having the forward done by Pat Conroy certainly helped as he is one of my favorite all time authors, so I dug in. I can't believe I'd never had this book recommend to me before, especially since I'm an outspoken hater of Lincoln (may he and Sherman burn in hell forever). I mean I really hate murderous invaders so hating Lincoln is easy, I never understood how people can make a hero out of both Washington (fighting for self rule) and Lincoln (invading to stop self rule), but I digress.What was really amazing about this book is that Mitchell managed to give a history lesson and wonderful historical flavor without ever actually \"telling\" the reader, she just \"showed\" us and it was wonderful and delightful to read.The is so much rewritten history and people really don't understand much of what they believe or even why they believe it so anyone that thinks they know the about the invasion of the South in the War of 61 and they haven't read this, they are not being honest in what they say they know, they can't be. The way the characters show how life was compared to what we are often taught or simply left to believe because we view things through modern lenses is really an amazing feat and the reason why this is such a good novel.Now to the love and the hate and the clash of personalities and the human nature and on and on, I can't say enough about how great this book is. So much popular modern writing is just trash, or fluff, compared to this depth of characterization, and here's a little clue why: modern writers tend to give us hero's with minor flaws, Scarlet is written very sympathetically, one can't help but love her, and love her deeply in fact, yet she's often wicked, she's certainly totally self absorbed and in modern times we'd probably call her a complete narcissist, BUT we the reader simply can't help but love her.The race relationships in the book are very insightful and give the reader understanding into the culture and mores of the time, and read with a view to the future one can see the root of much of today's racial problems in America, the South was destroyed by the North, the slaves may have been freed in one quick stroke, but they were free for what? The economy was destroyed, enormous wealth was destroyed, and the seeds of resentment and hatred were watered, not just in the hearts of the Southern white upper classes, but in the Northern whites, the poor, the blacks and everyone that suffered huge loss by the actions of state in it's conquest for power.I wish I'd read this book sooner, but now that I have I'll continue to recommend it to any one interested in a great novel of American and Confederate history, and of love, love the universal, the love of family, the love of a woman. Love and hatred, two sides of the same coin and separated by slivers of fate.",
            "The hard cover book - it's actual cover was really disappointingly plain and as it was a present, I felt let down to give such a plain gift. The book itself is a classic and I am sure my daughter will enjoy reading it.",
            "This item I received in prestine condition. It is a rare version of the book in the first place (and antique), so that's very impressive. The shipping time was very fast as well, and there was even a cordial note inside the book thanking me for my purchase and with added information. Very pleased!",
            "I honestly purchased the kindle edition Of this book by mistake, but decided to give it a go. I'm so glad I did! What a wonderful historical drama. The characters created and the setting during the social and political upheaval of the us civil war makes this book a must read for anyone into historical novels true or not.",
            "\"Gone with the Wind\" by Margaret Mitchell is an important work of literature set in the times of the American Civil War. It is a long book, but I read it quickly. Everytime the story started to slow down, something big happened which brought the momentum back.I would like to warn potential readers however that this not a book to read if you want to sit back and have a relaxing read. The book has a story that is very tumultuous and at times sad. This book is one of the most dramatic books I have read.The book follows the life of a 16 year-old girl in Confederate Georgia called Scarlett O'hara. She is attractive both physically and in the manner in which she acts. I had a huge crush on her when I was reading the book. She wants desperately to marry a young man called Ashley Wilkes who is engaged to a nice girl called Melanie.The book has a number of characters that appear in it also. The most noteworthy is Rhett Butler. Rhett Butler is a speculator who becomes a hero in Georgia for bringing supplies and goods to it through the Union blockade. Although people are grateful to him for bringing in supplies and goods, some have issues with his lack of moral convictions. His character is so macho, he is too macho. To me he seemed like a monster. At the beginning of the book Scarlett has a low opinion of him and I thought that was understandable. I'm a guy, so I don't know what exactly women would think of him, but I suspect that some women might be turned on by his predatory nature viewing him as extremely masculine.Although Scarlett is more physically attractive than Melanie, the girl Ashley Wilkes is engaged to, I actually thought that Melanie was more romantic than the mean-spirited Scarlett O'hara. At times I really felt bad for Melanie who wasn't loved enough by Ashley.\"Gone with the Wind\" takes place during the Civil War and fortunately it doesn't romanticize it. The book makes it clear that many soldiers were coming home maimed or crippled. The book shows that the Civil War was a gruesome conflict.From reading about Scarlett O'hara in \"Gone with the Wind\" I feel that I got a real insight into how women like her think. I now know that such women are not entirely noble although they may claim to be.",
            "I purchased Gone with the Wind (paperback) for my wife's 58th birthday because she had finally worn out the copy she has read repeatedly over the years since high school. We meant to replace it for more than a year, and I came up with the idea to surprise her with it, and her birthday was the perfect time. She told me once that while in high school the book was assigned and she just could not get herself through it, but it was a big deal at the local theater and viewing the movie helped her ace the test! Then post graduation she picked up the book and the rest is history. My purchase has made me a hero. My thanks for filling the order quickly and the timely delivering was greatly appreciated.",
            "This book is beautiful. I wanted a nice copy of the book for display after I read it and its perfect. The paper is textured and having the ribbon bookmark is great.This was a great purchase.",
            "Remembering when this book, \"Gone With The Wind\", first came out, my mother told me that my her brother, a doctor from Montreal Canada, who had settled in the USA, had read it all the way through, finding it compulsively readable. Years and years, (and years!), later, on the 50th Anniverary of GWTW, (the movie, I think), TV GUIDE ran two -- or perhaps it was three -- articles on this book / movie phenomenon. One was a general overview of the movie, and comments from surviving leading players. The other two were equally as fascinating: one was written by a White woman, the other, by a Black man.The White woman said that the value she had gotten from this book was that she had learnt from it, to withstand any hardship, no matter how great.The Black man said that he had been SO ashamed to buy this book. As much ashamed as he would have been, had he bought a pornography book! After reading it, he opined that it did NOT focus on the cruelty, pain, and degradation of slavery, but instead on a woman in love with another woman's financee and later, husband. He compared the book to a hypothetical novel set in World War II, wherein a Nazi officer, a guard in a concentration camp, was having a romance with a secretary. The pain and suffering of so many people, all around them, is all but ignored, in this hypothetical book, as all the attention is on the two lovers. Obviously, the Black gentleman who wrote this article for TV Guide did not like GWTW at all....I think it's important to keep BOTH viewpoints in mind. Because both are very accurate, and both speak volumes about the meaning of \"Gone With The Wind\".",
            "This book is sad, hilarious and extremely entertainig. You won't be able to put it down! The characters are so real!!! and the story is the GREATEST. I recommend this book over any other.",
            "I loved Gone with the Wind! It is such a good book. I'm 13, and I read GWTW in about 4 days. It is by far one of the best books I have ever read. If you don't read this GWTW, you will be missing something great.",
            "This book can touch so many emotions. From laughter to tears. The historical value even though the story is fiction, is remarkable.",
            "this is one of the most romantic books i've ever read..rhett butler is so amazingly suave and sophisticated yet so gentle...i love him more than any character in any other book...ashley's cute too...but in a very different way..scarlett has to be really blind!the book is lovely..its reallly worth a read...thumbs up,margaret mitchell..great job!",
            "I had been reading GWTW and I sat with the book one evening and I realised at dawn that I had been reading it the whole night. I haven't seen the movie yet, but I am fortunate that I read the book.",
            "I first read this book when was 18 years old and was totally impressed, 10 years have gone, and I have not yet read a book that has surpassed my impression as being one of the greatest books I have ever read.",
            "Though I read this when I was 11, a few months ago, I enjoyed it. I read one hundred pages a night and I couldn't stop until I finished it. I hope that more people enjoy this book as well.",
            "I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE VERY HARD TO BE PUT DOWN. AS SOON AS I BEGAN TO READ I WAS LOST INTO A WORLD THAT NO LONGER EXISTS. IN MY MIND I SAW WHAT SCARLET SAW AND FELT. THIS BOOK IS WELL WORTH THE TIME AND EFFORT. IT MAY SEEM LIKE A LONG BOOK BUT BY TIME THE WAR BEGINS YOU DON'T REALIZE THE BOOK IS ALMOST OVER. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO EVERYONE. I LOVE THE BOOK EVEN MORE THAN THE MOVIE. SO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? BUY YOUR COPY ALREADY.",
            "This is the greatest story ever written. It is not just the love story of Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara, but it is the saga of Scarlett's life, and how she blossoms from young sixteen-year-old to a strong willed woman. It will leave you breathless.",
            "we all love the movie with the leery Clark Gable and the fiery Vivien Leigh- but the novel is much, much more. With this classic, you find yourself bonding with Scarlet- hating her for her obstinate obsessions and agreeing with her basic desires. Melonie Hamilton isn't quite as serene as the movie, but she is just as goodie-goodie. Rhett Butler is good. I'm a high school student, and I read Gone with the Wind in the sixth grade. it was fabulous and everyone should be exposed to the all-too human Scarlet O'Hara.",
            "I am but 11 years old but I have read this book, and BELIEVE ME, it is definitely worth it. This book made me sob hysterically, laugh like a maniac, and understand what it was like to live during the Civil War. It actually made me wish I could have been alive during that time. My favorite character was definitely Melly. I won't spoil it for you but you have to read it.",
            "Wow, when i read this book i couldn't put it down! I actually saw the movie first,so when i read the book, I had an Idea what the charicters looked like. But i did not know that the movie was only half the story! I loved the movie just as much as the book, though others didnt. I have not read the sequal and im not planning to, from what i heard about it.My favorite charictor is Rhett. I dont know why. I think it is because whenever he popped up in the book, he always made me smile. I think that it was rhett and Melanie that made scarlett strong. They were standing behind her and pushing her along the way. Without them, Scarlett would not have been nearly as strong as she was. Gone with the Wind has some kind of charm that i cannot explain. From the first page it grabs you that no other book could posobly do. In this frenzy that we call our world, i know tht there was land of grace, beauty and, true love. Please read it!!",
            "What can I say? I LOVED this book. The characters were great, and the story was incredible! I love a book that can make you feel lots of emotions. I actually cried(a lot)! I don't do that a lot when I'm reading a book. It also made me feel happy, angry, blah blah, etc. The only possible downside is that the way slavery is depicted makes it seem better than it really was. But read it anyway, it's great!!! Oh, BTW, read the book first! It was so much better than the movie!",
            "I can truly understand why this book is so beloved to American culture. It has every single element of a great story written beautifully. The length may be daunting but I was surprised at what a &quot;short&quot; book it was to read. I absolutely loved Scarlett, though I wasn't so enthusiastic about melanie. If you haven't read it, you are MISSING OUT on something fabulous!",
            "This book is just wonderful! It's much better than the movie! I love how it is written, and how the charactors seem so real. Scarlett is so strong, but yet so misguided to what she wants. This isn't a perfect ending, but life doesn't always give a perfect ending, and that's what I like about GWTW. It's not a fairy story where everyone lives happily ever after, it's a story about live.",
            "I ablsolutely loved this book! It always kept me turning the pages. The descriptions were wonderfull and the story was the best ever!! This book will remain my favorite and it will always be remembered as a master piece. I recommend this book because I loved it and know you would too.",
            "This book is the best book i've ever read...it deserves more than a 5 star.I watched the movie last year and all i could remember is me smiling =) and crying =**|...it touched my heart! You've gotta read the book...you'll love it. Watch the movie too...it's a classic!***************************=)",
            "The novel Gone With the Wind was so beautifuly written that I cried at the end. This book descibes the south at the time before, after, and during the Civil War. It shows the strenth of a lady, Scarlett during these times. I love how Scarlett says at the end that she would think of it tomorrow at Tara. This is the best way Margrett Mitchell could have ended the book. Margrett did a outstanding job writting GWTW.",
            "Being a freshman in high school, my opinions are not usually taken for notice, however, I challenged myself in reading this book and found myself all the stronger a person for it. It truly gives the Southern point of view like nothing lese described to us Yankees. Amazing!",
            "i thought that this was a great book because it was a trying time in our history, and through that one woman got through everyhting. loosing her mother, father, and almost her land, that her father won, and worked. throgh everything, scarlett got her life back. even though the way she did it was not a great way. but rhett was great to her, and she realized that she really loved him when nothing else could be done. too little too late.",
            "Me being 11yrs. old didn't think that I would like this book. Boy was I wrong. This is my favorite book of all time! The only thing that I didn't like about the book which I know almost everybody will agree with me on is that it ends so suddenly not even giving you a hint to the outcome. Margaret Mitchell is so good that she can even capture an eleven yr. olds mind with an adult book. This book is easy to put people you know in the characters spots and just sit there all day and daydream a new ending. Did I mention that I loved this book?",
            "I first read GWTW, when I was just a kid and fell in love with it from the first line. No other book has come close to how I feel about this novel (save for Pride and Prejudice, Persuasion and Rebecca all running close seconds!)If you have only seen the movie version of this book, please do yourself a huge favor and read the book. It is amazing! Scarlett has so much more depth as a person than the way she is portrayed in the movie (Vivien Leigh was a perfect Scarlett don't get me wrong) You will come to understand her motives completely if you just read the Book! Apparently I cannot stress this enough. This is just the best book ever written!",
            "Ok, here's the deal. This book was great. I mean GREAT! I read it in 6th grade. The whole thing was so, so, so wonderful! I luved every bit of it, Except for.....the end. I hated the end! Why did she just leave us hanging? I mean Tomorrow everything will be alright? What kind of ending is that? So I had to get Scarlett. I luved Scarlett too. And I was glad that there was actually an ending, but the ending was kind of boring.",
            "This book was beautifully written, and had just the right amount of romance, action, drama, and loneliness that it became a captivating novel. I could not put this one down. It is unforgetable.",
            "Gone With the Wind is the best book I've ever read! It is breathtaking and thrilling. It describes the civil war along with Scarlett's life during it. It is a really wonderful book that takes you back in time. I loved this book. I am only 13, and I think anyone my age should read this book, because it rocks. It is sad, but still its the best. Read it, and I know you'll love it",
            "&quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; was one of the most exciting books the I have ever read. I really like the part when Ashley all of a sudden has feelings for her. But, the best part about the book is how I could not put the book down. I first read the book 5 years ago when I was in the fifth grade, but then I re-read it last year. I understood it even more. I am now trying to give it to people so that they can read it. It is also one of my favorite books. I recommend this book to anybody, male or female, young or old. So enjoy &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;.",
            "I noticed that there are no Arabs casting their opinions, so i am glad to give you mine. When i was 14, my father gave me a special edition for the youth, and told me:&quot; read this book, you will enjoy it&quot;. Well, ladies and gentelmen i started reading it in Thursday afternoon, and i didn't put it untill Friday night. The book is simply wonderfull, and later when i was growing up (i am 28 now) i read the full version two more times, and some passages ( especially the first encounter between Scarlet and Rhett at the library)countless times. I think the strength of the book lies in its strong and very believble characters ( although i think there is little exaggeration in the power and charm of Rhett). The supporting characters are very believble as well, and although you might think that there is huge diffrence between USA and the Arab world, but the truth is we are people, and apart from few diffrences, the basic emotions, and behaviour are almost the same, that is why the book has such an enourmous success in all the world and with all ages and throughout its history. And as one of the reviewr pointed, that each country knew some major changes to its society, another reason why the book was a huge success. As for the romantic story, it is very powerfull as well. Finally, i would like to say, that i am almost Copy of Ashely Wilkes( without the skill of riding ..lol), and usualy i like the types of Melanie, but you can't help your self and admire Scarlett as a fiction heroine, although i doubt very much i would like her if i met her. I personaly strongly recommend this book.BUT i would like to make a warning for everyone thinking of reading the sequell, because the sequell is no more than a litreature piracy in my opinion, and it is a pure rubbish, and you can better buy a cheap romantic novel insted.I woul love if someone sent me an e mail.",
            "This book is even better than the movie--really! I began reading this as an escape from a pretty hectic time in my life, and couldn't put it down for about three days, until I got Scarlet out of the danger of the war. This novel combines romance, strength, family loyalty, love of home, and many other values into one exciting story. Definitely check this out!",
            "This is not the type of book I usually read. I am into Mary Higgans Clark and John Grisham. I only read this book because of school, and thought that I could sort of skim through it. Well after the first sentence I couldn't help but read every page word for word. This book is a page turner if I've ever seen one. You would think that the ending would be annoying, because it is so open, but I love it. I won't ever read the sequel because it could never even come close to the book. No matter hot good it is GWTW will be a thousand times better. I read this book in 10 days. That's like 100 pages a day, but I even forgot there were 1000 pages. You get so involved in the romance of Scarlett and Rhett that you could care less of the thickness of the book. I you haven't read this book, your are missing out on not only the greatest love story ever, but the greatest novel ever written. I picked up the book thinking that I had to read a book during the summer and that with all the talk about this one I might as well try it. I soon realized that ever positive review I have read about it can't come close to describing this book.",
            "This is my all time favorite book. I read it in the eigth grade and since them I have read it several times. I first started reading this book because of the movie, but after reading the first few hundred pages, I virtually forgot that there was a movie. The 1939 movie with Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable is spectacular but Mitchell's book surpasses that greatness. This is the novel that proves the saying that the book is always better than the movie.I have read all the reviews that people have published on this site and it amazes me that anyone gave GTWT less than five stars. I couldn't put this book down!Gone With the Wind is romance to the highest degree and it only improves each time I read it. Scarlet's encounters with Rhett are my favorite part of this book. Everytime they meet it draws me in. The thing that makes this book great however, is that it isn't just about romance, it is about survival and although Scarlet isn't the nicest person like Melanie, it is hard to not root for her. She does everything all the way and never holds back what she is feeling.",
            "Gone With The Wind is a timeless romance that depicts agreat picture of what life was like during and after the Civil War. Once loved by all the men in the County, Scarlett's life takes a turn after the war. She ends uo in Atlanta where her reputation is ruined by gossip. The ending was kind of disappointing, but it leaves plenty of room to imagine what could happen. There is something for everyone to relate to in this book. I have no doubt that this book will always be remembered as the greatest romance novel of all time.",
            "This was another book to be read and studied in English class. Every one of my peers thought that this book was going to be like most of the other books that we had had to read that year, but I wasn't so sure, as I was just beginning to learn to love the classics and literature books in the library. So, being curious, I read the 1024 page book in under a week, and I found it a marvelous book. It touches wonderfully on the hardships and problems of the civil war years in the South, and the feelings of the proud Southerners toward the Yankees and slaves after the war had ended and they found themselves stripped of their old ways of the plantation living (this book mainly touches on the lifestyles of the richer plantation owners, rather than the majority of Southerners, or the poor ones who owned just a little farm, and often no slaves). It centers around the story of Scarlett O'Hara, daughter of a great lady and a rich Irish plantation owner. It is a funny and charming story of Scarlett's love problems: she can have any man that she wants in the South, yet she wants an engaged man! The book goes through her funny predicaments and actions as she struggles to stay alive in the present, with her dreams of the past behind her...It also goes on about a notorious man named Rhett Butler, who associates himself with Scarlett, and yet who is not accepted in any home in Atlanta, Georgia, nor the South for that matter. This book is recommended to anyone who likes romance stories or books with heroines in them. In fact, I recommend this to anyone who can stand reading long, wonderful books.",
            "Gone With the Wind takes place in the 1800's and is about an American girl named Scarlett O'Hara trying to fit in Atlantas society . Scarlett is a ordinary girl who just seems to bend the rules a little.She goes to parties and balls like all other girls. The Civil War starts and turns her world upside down. She has to learn to do things that women don't do but she does it just to survive. She learns to work the fields, runs lumber mills,and a store. Society throws her out because she is doing things women wouldn't dare do even to survive. She has to deal with all the hardships of war.She loses many loved one due to fighting and starvation. While all of this is happening she meets a man named Rhett Butler who helps her tremendelsy. He picks her up from all of her troubles and survive and tries to get back her place in society. I would recommend this book for anyone who likes romance novels.",
            "Gone with the Wind is a classic that everyone should read. This book is filled with romance, adventure, and hope. Watch Scarlett weave her way through different husbands and lovers while trying to keep her family alive. As opposed to Melanie, Scarlett is rather self-centered and never really changes, she does not care what anyone thinks of her and is prepared to do her own thing. Melanie is a loving, caring, considerate young women who always wants the best for everyone, including her husband, Ashley and Scarlett. I think that this is a great book that is really worth reading. There is constatantly hope for better times, even when better times have come.",
            "Being a Atlanta belle myself and seeing the movie many times I decided to read the book. The begining was quite boring, but after I to page 300 or so I really started to enjoy the book. I really like it and was really sad when it ended, but some or the things I didn't understand. Scarlett really seemed to marry Frank for his money, but she also seemed to love him because she gave him a kid and she slept with him for a couple of years. She seems to dislike her kids, but at times she acts like she couldn't leave them for anything. I really felt sorry for Rhett in the end because in the movie he doesn't tell how much he loves her. The movie doesn't really interpret how bad Scarlett's live was effected by the war. I really loved the book and really wished Margaret Mitchell had a chance to write a second book.",
            "I had seen the movies like 20 thousand times when I decided to read the book. I got to about page 250 when I stopped uninterested. About three months later on a dare I checked out Scarlett and started to read it. I really loved it, but many of the characters mentioned were people I had never heard of in the movie. Very confused and wanting to get it all figured out I got GWTW and started to read it again. This time I made myself keep reading and after about page 400 it started to get really interesting. I read from page 400 to the end in two and a half days and was terribly upset when it ended. I think this a great book and know I am on a search for ever Civil War book written.",
            "I just finished this book and LOVED IT! The development of the book is great. The character development is great. IT'S JUST GREAT! Yet when she argues with Ashley it get's oh so gooey! If you want to read it but freaked by the fact that it's 1036 pages, trust me, Mrs. Mitchells writing style is easy and american and you'll be under its spell in no time!",
            "Gone with the Wind lived up to its reputation and then some. It is a story of the south at the time of its fall. It is a story of Scarlett O'Hara and her journey from being a immature Southern Bell to a mature intelligent women. It is a fantatisc romance novel.",
            "I read it when I was 11 and I could hardly put it down, it took me 5 days to read this amazing book. Sure there is a dead spot in the middle and it gets a little depressing, but it is worth the read. I recommend this book to anyone who likes civil war romance.",
            "I read Gone with the Wind last summer and could not put it down...and then I read it again. I've read many great books in the classic genre, but none have been able to captivate me as Gone with the Wind has. Mitchell paints her characters so vivdly that as you read about their hardships during the Civil War and Reconstruction you just want to cry. Gone with the Wind is truly one of the best books ever written.",
            "I READ THIS BOOK AT ABOUT THE AGE OF 14. IT WAS THE FIRST BOOK ,EVEN AT THE LENGTH IT IS, THAT I DIDN'T WANT TO END! I SO MUCH WANTED THE CHARACTERS TO CONTINUE! WHEN I FINALLY SAW THE MOVIE YEARS LATER-IT WAS MORE THAN I COULD HAVE ASKED FOR. IT WAS ABOUT THAT TIME THAT I FELL IN LOVE WITH CLARK GABLE! I FEEL THAT THIS BOOK WAS THE ORIGINAL HISTORICAL ROMANCE NOVEL, AND THAT EVERYTHING ELSE PALES IN COMPARISON!",
            "GONE WITH THE WIND is an excellent novel for a first time novelist, despite its many flaws. Scarlett O'Hara is one of the most memorable characters in literary history and Miss Mitchell's description of the Civil War years in Georgia is well-paced and exciting. Unfortunately, the second half of the book does not live up to the promise of the first. The pace is not as swift and Miss Mitchell's description of Reconstruction is a tad one-sided (though understandably so). The novel's main weaknesses seem to be Scarlett's long-running infatuation for Ashley Wilkes. Given their characters and Scarlett's acquaintance of Rhett Butler, this infatuation borders on the realms of disbelief. Another weakness of the book is the lack of thorough editing. In Part One, Miss Mitchell nearly devoted an entire chapter on the Tarleton family, who happened to be secondary characters. Other than that, Miss Mitchell did an excellent job. It seemed a shame that she did not continue her writing career.",
            "(4.5 stars, actually)I've never seen the movie all of the way through; every time it's been on I've either tuned in after it started or had to eat dinner, go to bed, or something that necessitated my having to interrupt my viewing of it. Reading the book finally got across the story in one piece. I normally dislike what Hollywood does to books adapted for the screen, but after reading the book, I agree that this is one of the few exceptions. And if you liked the movie, the book will be even better because of all of the characters and events left out (such as Scarlett's older two children Wade and Ella). One thing the movie was right to leave out, however, was the stomach-churning racism.I have no problem with an author having characters spout viewpoints that are racist (sexist, anti-Semitic, homophobic, etc.), but here those viewpoints aren't just limited to their dialogues and inner thoughts. There are a LOT of editorial commentaries on, for example, how wonderful slavery was, how the only good slave is one that was happy to be a slave, and all of the old stereotypes about African-Americans (sexual predators, lazy, childlike, superstitious, easily frightened, snoops, liars, thieves, you name it). The word &quot;Negro&quot; is never even capitalised, and many times the other n word is used to refer to them, as in &quot;a niggery smell&quot; and &quot;trashy free-issue niggers.&quot; I know that in 1936 no one was saying African-American or even Black, but at least you could capitalise the word Negro or not use the word &quot;darky&quot; so often! Many of the African-American characters even call themselves and members of their own race the n word. These slaves support their white masters, hating the slaves who dare feel themselves equal to whites and who wanted to be free. There are also two anti-Semitic slights; on page 734 it says of Hugh Elsing (who is incompetent and not very smart in business) &quot;Anyone could Jew him down on prices.&quot; On page 759 Rhett asks Scarlett if she might have some Jewish &quot;blood&quot; in her as well as Irish blood because of her love of money. The real reason Scarlett hires convicts to work in her mill is because they're cheaper, easier to exploit, and less &quot;uppity&quot; than the &quot;trashy free-issue&quot; former slaves. What other book with such racism on nearly every page is still in print today?Most Southerners were Crackers and white trash, not rich aristocrats like Scarlett and her friends, yet there's not one good word to be found about the Crackers. You'd think the aristocrats were in the majority and that barely any slaves were ever mistreated or had just cause to run away. They didn't even see how ironic it was that they were in the destitute position that the Crackers and slaves had been in for generations. The racism gets even more frequent and ugly in Part Two, the Reconstruction era. You'd never know that the KKK were a terrorist organisation; we're supposed to applaud these racist murderers and feel bad that the Yankees have taken over control? The only Southern state to avoid martial law was Tennessee, because they ratified the 14th Amendment. But of course, the other Southern states were too proud and angry to do that. And they got what they wanted before long; Reconstruction ended, African-Americans were effectively barred from exercising their Constitutional rights to vote for almost a hundred years, the Republicans (who were the progressive party way back when) were hounded out of town and threatened away from the polls, and the rich white men regained monopoly over the polls. The way it's written, you'd think the newly freed slaves, the Republicans, and the &quot;Scallawags&quot; were the ones going around terrorising people instead of the Democrats and the KKK! Still, the racism isn't the main point of the story, so I can overlook it to a point since the rest of the story is so great.The characters in the book are even better than in the movie; here Rhett isn't some charming rake, he's downright nasty, sleazy, seedy, suspicious, like an interesting-evil villain on a soap opera, the bad guy whose motivations are interesting and not mean for the sake of meanness. He's an incredible match for Scarlett, a strong empowered woman in her day and age, not afraid to flount social conventions by going out in public pregnant or shortening the period of mourning after her husbands die, a woman who has the smarts and the guts to run her own businessess because her second husband is too soft-hearted and incompetent to run them properly himself. Ashley is also a lot better in the book; he's such a doofus in the movie, but here we can understand why Scarlett is in love with him all of these years, why he inspires such passion and devotion in this fiery woman, a woman who wouldn't have spent so much time and emotion on the wimp he's portrayed as in the movie!The book does a great job at showing a Southern pov in the Civil War and Reconstruction; it would have been perfect if there hadn't been so much repugnant racist editorialising and just presented the viewpoints of these people from a vanished way of life in an unbiased way. It just looks unprofessional, besides racist, for an author to constantly inject personal opinions into the text.",
            "This book has a very involving story and I quite literally could not put it down, though I did a few times in outrage over the portrayal of slavery, the Civil War, and the Reconstruction. This novel exemplifies the Lost Cause movement, which showed the Confederacy as noble but outnumbered, and slavery as a benign and paternal institution. It is worth reading for the story, but I shudder to think that some may take what it states as fact. I am not saying that the book should be banned or censored, but it is certainly difficult to read the numerous descriptions of freedmen as lazy and the countless explanations that slaves were just so dumb that they needed the care of white people.Also, Scarlett O'Hara is a terribly unlikeable character. Whether she is stealing her sister's boyfriend or daydreaming about murdering her only true friend, Ashley, her actions and thoughts will just appall you. She is also phenomenally oblivious, not realizing that Rhett loves her until it is far too late. I was sad that Rhett left her, but who could blame him??",

            "This is an incredible book. The story is enthralling, the grammar superb... whether you like adventure, romance, or historical fiction, this is the book for you! And the price is a bargain!",
            "I first read this book in fifth grade, for a reading contest. Since then I reread it about every other year. Mitchell takes me into a whole different world with her story of Scarlett and Rhett, Melanie and Ashley. I love it!",
            "This book was very well written. It was a classic. I was intrigued at how well Margaret Mitchell spun this story together. Scarlett was a character that had so many different characteristics about her than I doubted it would ever end. You meet Scarlett O'Hara in Tara and soon you find out of her passionate love for Ashley Wilkes. War is declared on the South and Ashley marries his cousin Melanie Wilkes. Scarlett becomes jealous and as a way to get back at him she marries Melanie's own brother, Charles Wilkes. Charles and Ashley go to war leaving Melanie in Atlanta and Scarlett in Tara. Shortly after Scarlett gets a telegram informing her of her husbands death. She is desperate to get out of black widow's clothes. She goes to Atlanta to stay with her Aunt Pittypat while she tries to get used to wearing all black and never dancing. There they meet Rhett Butler for the first time. Soon Scarlett realizes shes pregrant with her dead husbands baby. Scarlett has the baby fine with no troubles. The Southern army passes through Atlanta and Ashley visits Scarlett and Melanie. Melanie gets pregnant. Nine months pass by and Melanie is deathly ill and is going to have the baby shortly. Siege is laid on Atlanta while the baby is near coming. Scarlett is forced to deliver the baby for all the doctors were busy with wounded soldiers. Scarlett takes charge and Melanie, Scarlett, Beau(The newborn), and Scarlett's child all flee to Tara. After a ravaging journey Scarlett makes it safely. After Scarlett sets up Tara to running again her and Melanie go to Atlanta once more. Ashley returns and Scarlett decides to marry her sister's bethrothed, Frank Kennedy, for his money. She uses his money to keep Tara running and she starts her own Lumber mill, something unheard of before this time, a woman working was taboo. Her husband and Ashley go to a Klu Klux Klan meeting and Ashley gets shot and Frank dies by a bullet to his head. Rhett goes and gets Ashley and saves him from the Northern army by pretending that Ashley had been visiting Belle Watlings house of 'ill repute'. Rhett proposes to Scarlett and they visit New Orleans and many places. Scarlett is happy. Then she has a baby girl who Rhett dotes on. Scarlett and Rhett fight a lot over silly things and then Rhett lets the girl jump with her horse and she falls, breaks her neck, and dies instantly. Rhett and Scarlett fight and Rhett comes home drunk one night and they have a few 'passionate' moments and Rhett leaves for good. He comes back and Scarlett tells him shes pregnant. He says rude things and she lunges for him, misses and falls down some stairs. She has a miscarriage and Rhett leaves with his famous line. \"Frankly my dear, I dont give a damn,\".",
            "Everyone knows this story, even without reading the book so I thought I'd add a bit about Mitchell's racist attitude towards the slaves. There are conversations amongst Scarlett and her family/friends regarding the Northern's erroneous assumptions about their slaves. They claim that they would never beat their slaves nor know of anyone that would behave that way. Of course we know that slaves were abused but there is huge denial here. Mitchell's characters also portray the slaves as child like, and the owners justify slavery saying that the Negroes are too child like to take care of themselves. Also remember that the men in Scarlett's lives are part of the KKK. Mitchell sees the group as Southerners protecting their family.It's astounding how much of this attitude is not commented upon. We could all learn that Mitchell's attitude is the type of thinking that people used to justify slavery and the treatment of Blacks after they were freed.Of course the novel itself is full of compelling characters, even if it is at heart a soap opera. Scarlett and Rhett are drawn so deeply that they feel that you would know them if you encountered them. By all means read the novel, but don't dismiss the racism.",
            "Margaret Mitchell may have only written one book, but she well deserved the awards she won and the praises bestowed upon her. I have read this book twice and was taken aback both times by her colorful yet brutally honest account of the Civil War, mixed with her artful and often humorous accounts of emotion and the social expectations of the period. This book is truly an \"objet d'art\", a wonderfully sculpted work, that is ageless and timeless. It takes one's breath away with its mix of humor and brutality; its insight of human behavior, propriety, pride, vanity, and patriotism. This book, and the part of her soul (a great part, I may add), will never die.",
            "On the one hand, Gone with the Wind is a wonderful novel. Scarlett O'Hara is probably one of the best female characters I've ever read in a classic novel. She is not nice. She is not good. And yet, the most interesting characters rarely are. Melanie Hamilton Wilkes and Ellen Rollibard O'Hara were wonderful women, but the point of Scarlett is she will never be that woman. She's resourceful. She's \"a scoundrel.\" When the women of the South are thrown out of their comfortable lives Scarlett claws her way back to the top - and doesn't learn until the very end that she lost everyone for it. Her determination is her greatest asset and her biggest tragedy. But at the end, when she has lost everything, she decides to keep going as always.On that same hand, it's a wonderful story. The five parts are set up like a Shakespearean Play. Margaret Mitchell, for all her faults, is a wonderful writer and her descriptions put you in the story. She's also an intelligent enough writer to be able to write from the viewpoint of many different people, even if she mostly sticks with Scarlett's point of view.But on the other hand, the descriptions of slavery are offensive. While I believe that there were probably some benevolent plantation owners and some slaves that wanted to stay with their families (although, in the novel, it's interesting that the \"house\" slaves - the ones who lived with the family day by day and recieved many more privilages - are the only ones who care to stay while the field hands leave as soon as possible), slavery was indeed a horrible institution. And the novel does seem to argue that it was all better before with slavery (although the North gets the brunt of the blame for wrecking things - even though the South are blamed for starting it). Also, some of the heroes of the novel are Klan members, and the only criticism of their choice is that it's \"too dangerous\" and \"not the way to get things done.\"As offensive as these thoughts may be to modern sensibilites, the novel still remains a great work of art. I resisted reading this book for a long time, but now I'm glad I did. For all its faults, I highly recommend it.",
            "Ok, wow! What a great book! I first saw &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; on a classic movie channel, and now I've read the book. If you buy it, you will not put it down - I mean I read 1041 pages in 3 days! This book will make you cry, for Rhett and Scarlett and is the best book I've ever read. It will make you cry so much, and personally, I really disliked Ashley for leading Scarlett on. This book is NOT racist, and it will give you a sense of romance better than Titanic ever could! The book describes Rhett's eyes, and make him come to life soooo much, and at the end it's sooo sad. Which is why I'm going to buy the sequel! Beware it leaves you hanging. Possibly the best book ever written EVER! BUY IT!",
            "Margaret Mitchell's classic may be an historical novel, but it is packed with the truth of what was done to a peaceful and blameless section of our Country. Most people do not realize the huge numbers of Europeans (unsuccessful in their Revolutions of 1848)who came to this Country, were given enlistment bonuses (when fresh from the boat) and allowed to wreak havoc on a people whom they held responsible for all of their miserable conditions. Mrs. Mitchell weaves an excellent story, filled with characters who are relevent, even in today's world, while utilizing, as a backdrop, one of the world's greatest tradgedies. It is obvious that Mrs. Mitchell used a large number of primary sources in writing her book, and it deserves to be placed at the top of every literate person's reading list.",

I never tire of the story and the author is amazingly descriptive. This is not your typical love story and it leaves you wanting more.",
            "I absolutley LOVE this book. It is not only the precedence setter for Historical Fiction, but it also paved the way for women writers to be recognized.Margaret Mitchell took a great many chances on the situations, characters, and \"scandals\" presented in this epic story of the Old South.It is the standard upon which all modern literary historical-romance fiction books are based.Good strong characters (many who were not even mentioned in the movie), and a story that is perfect for any season to read.Go ahead...buy the book in Hardback. This book accompanied me to war in the Middle East, and from its characters, I have continually found \"something new\". While you are at it..go ahead and purchase Donald McCraig's Rhett Butler's People. Make sure you read Gone with the Wind first, then set your engine speed on high...you are about to go into overdrive!",
            "This is one of the best fictions I have read in American literature. It narrates the personal struggle of our not always likable but always resilient and resourceful heroine Scarlett O'Hara, and her relationship with the cynical and worldly Rhett Butler. It is also a sweeping saga of the people of the American South (mostly two locales in Georgia: Tara Plantation and Atlanta), spanning from antebellum to Civil War to the Reconstruction. Michell's writing is superb; it is full of details and nuances to the southern life, especial life in the plantations and life in Atlanta. The personalities of the characters are consistent and believable. Even descriptions of minor events and characters are vivid, such as the conversion between Gerald O'Hara and Mrs. Tarleton and her daughters on the way to the barbecue, from the chorus of the girls' shrieking and arguing you really get a rich and lively picture of antebellum Southern life. Of course, we shouldn't confuse the author's nostalgic and overly-romanticized view of Southern plantation life with reality, but this is a fiction, not a historical study. I find it hard to fault the author for painting a picture from the perspective that she chose (that is, a white plantation owner's perspective), just like you cannot criticize a painting of peaceful rural scenery for not exposing the garbage dump and outer house.But the book is not without flaws, and I see two major ones:1. Racism. I don't think anyone can really defend the author for this. It is one thing that her characters say and think in racist terms, but she also expressed such opinions numerous times in the narrator's voice. Some defend her by saying that it is because of the time (1920s-1930s) that Michell wrote this book; that may be true, but it does not exempt her from such criticism. I would rather say it is a \"flaw of her time\" than \"not a flaw because of her time\".2. The reconstruction part (Part Four) of the book is a little dragging. Some tangential characters such as Will Benteen and Archie introduced in this part are an awkward fit to the storyline and they certainly do not add much to the central plot (not surprisingly, they were completely eliminated in the movie). In this period Butler's role also became more shadowy, except at the end when he rescued the men from their ill-fated Shantytown revenge. I get a sense that Mitchell was really critical of the reconstruction and she was just drawing this out to give herself more room to air her criticism.Nevertheless, even with these flaws, it is really an exquisitely crafted piece of work. It will always have its place in the Alta of American literature.",
            "It started very slow for me, with Scarlett's fleeting thoughts about her dresses and balls. Then every time it became intriguing the conflict resolved itself, except for the conflict between Scarlett and Rhett which only gradually compounded. The d&eacute;nouement was poignant and well conceived-- perhaps it's just the romantic in me but I choose to see the end as just the beginning.",
            "this is a great book and I am enjoying every page. I read the book many years ago but it is worth reading again very nice to read on a kindle",
            "This book was advertised as large print which is what my elderly mother needed. It arrived and it was not large print but normal print. The company apologized and stated they did not have a large print but to keep the book they sent.",
            "I have to say, at about 60-80 pages in, I was tempted to give up on this monstrous, 1000+ beast of a book, but Ifm glad I didnft. I have this strange compulsion to ALWAYS finish books, despite how bad they are in the beginning, in the hopes they get better. And this one certainly did.I wonft spend much time on plot, because truthfully, the only people that arenft aware of the basic plot of this book are those of you who were like me and obviously living under the largest rock in the world. Ifd like to start, instead, with Scarlett.Scarlett happens to be the most reprehensible, vile, and childish character Ifve ever encountered. And I love her. No matter how foolish I thought she was, I always wanted to read on to see what happened to her. I think this is where Mitchell really did something really wonderful. It is almost impossible to have complete disgust in a character and still want to know what her ending is. This is how I felt about Scarlett. I wanted to shake her until she developed some semblance of sense, but I then realized that this book has a sense of a bildungsroman to it. Yes, it is about life during the Civil War, and about romance, and many other things, but itfs mainly about Scarlett and her journey to womanhood. In my personal opinion, the interesting part is that she never really reaches that womanhood, despite all her hardships.I am not one for historical fiction. I will admit that I like historical war fiction even less. But although the novel is set during the time of the Civil War, and there are excerpts of the battles in it, I wasnft overwhelmed enough by it to dislike it. It was vaguely interesting to me, and didnft take away from the main story.I also wouldnft call this a romance, because, for all intents and purposes, Scarlett is never in love with anyone. She appears to be in love with Ashley throughout the entire book, and despite the many comments I may receive about this, I truthfully donft think she was ever in love with Rhett. I think she was in love with the idea of both of these men. The only person Scarlett is in love with is herself. And the only thing she is in love with is money. Which brings me to my next point: Mitchell took a huge risk making Scarlett the woman she did.Scarlett become a strong, independent, although still childish, woman. Her only gfallh is that she realizes she glovesh Rhett too late in the game, and has to (presumably) spend her life wanting him and never fully having him. Generally, when women of the 1800s are fictionalized as strong and independent, there are seriously negative connotations associated with them. You see this some with Scarlett, but she doesnft let it affect her. She is all in all strong. Silly in many regards, but strong. This is where Mitchell, in my opinion, really broke the mold. She allowed her character to suffer through so much pain and heartache and yet let her continue as an unbroken woman. Scarlett doesnft appear to be marred by anything but her own agenda. And I absolutely respect that, even though I still think she needs a bit more sense.I have to give this one s s s s. I truly loved it, with the exception of the lack of a love story. I guess in my head, I had considered this the greatest romance of all time (and I honestly couldnft tell you where I got this misperception), and I really found that lacking. Other than that, I would recommend this book to anyone who even remotely enjoys reading.If you enjoyed this review, come read others at [...]!",

            "Gone With the Wind was written by Margaret Mitchell and was published in 1936. This book is mainly about the difficult times for Scarlett O'Hara. The book was focused around the era of the Civil War. Gone With the Wind is a romance story about Scarlett O'Hara,her love of her homeland, Tara, and her search for love. She was jealous of Melanie Wilkes who married her cousin, Ashley, whom Scarlett desired. In the rage of Ashley marrying Melanie, Scarlett marries the first man who asks her, Melanie's brother Charles. Within 2 months Charles dies in the Civil War leaving her with a baby. She desperately tries to win over Ashley by moving in with Melanie and Melanie's aunt after Charles died. When Scarlett becomes bored with her living conditions, she goes to a fundraiser and meets Rhett Butler, a wealthy man from Georgia and he falls in love with her. But Rhett is very annoyed with the fact that Scarlett is in love with Ashley. Then tragedies start when the Civil War comes close to Georgia and Atlanta. Melanie gets pregnant and Ashley goes to war because Atlanta is attacked. Scarlett would have to escape back home to Tara before the Yankees come. Scarlett, along with her son Wade, her servant Prissy, Melanie, and Melanie's son Beau travel to the plantation Tara, where Scarlett was born, and Scarlett finds no food, no animals, only 2 remaining servants, a dead mother, an insane father, and 2 sick sisters. In desperation to survive, Scarlett marries Rhet Butler, and has a baby girl named Ella. She realizes too late that Rhett is her true love, but Rhett is tired of being second to Ashley, and leaves Scarlett. She decides she wants to get Rhett back, and then says \"I won't think about that today, I'll think about that tomorrow. After all, tomorrow is another day.\" I enjoyed the book a lot, and would recommend it to anyone who has a lot of time, and likes to read love stories. It was long, but the author, Margaret Mitchell told the story of the civil war very detailed and colorful, and had a way with her words to make ever page enjoyable, and memorable.",
            "I was a little disappointed with this hyped-up book. Melly was all good and Scarlett all bad. This plot is good, but I think Margaret Mitchell did not develop the characters as much as she could have. Humans are not either good or bad, everyone has a bit of both in them. However, I could not put it down, and it is such an epic story of American history that I would recommend it, just don't expect it to be as great as it is said to be.",
            "Atlanta belle, Scarlett O'hara ,deals with the impacts of the Civil War and the reconstruction of the south. Scarlett is a feminist, driven to extremes to ensure her future well-being and wealth; she is selfish and egotistical, but admirable in her stubbornness. This book is an epic, starting at secession and ending during reconstruction with carpetbaggers and scalawags stripping the south of its feudal past. The book is to some extent racist and revisionist southern pride. Was this Margarett Mitchell's interpretation of how southern's themselves feel in the 20th century, or does she truly believe that slaves were relatively happy as prisoners on a plantation? This book is heavy on the romance and light on the history, making it an average book",
            "I only knew the story from the movie, so I bought this book ... The first half of the book was ok, I liked the descriptions of the suffocating constraints of upper class society at the time and Scarlett's rejection of them. The devastation of war and the struggle that Scarlett and her family went through were powerful. However, that second half of the book completely turned me off the the story. Margret Mitchell's descriptions of the reconstruction were so vile I almost put the book down. Blacks were only happy being slaves, they were too stupid for anything else. The only good blacks in the book are the ones who can serve the whites. Big Sam says he had enough of freedom and wants to go back to Tara. He even states incredulously that while in the north whites wanted him to sit at the table like he was their equal, but he couldn't do it because he is not the equal to whites. Mitchell actually says that he smiles and feels better when Scarlett starts to tell him what to do because someone is telling him what to do again. At one point Mitchell is describing how the southern whites hate the Yankees so much because the Yankees have money and food and power and they do not, yet she doesn't have any sense of irony to see that the whites are in the position that they put the slaves in for centuries.And another thing that I did not like about the book is that most of the characters are serious sociopaths. They kill anyone who breaks their rules of racial propriety. Rhett kills a black man for being \"upity\" to a white woman, another character, one of the Fontaine boys, kills a black man for for saying something to a white woman. We are not told what but it is pretty obvious it was sexual, so we have the sterotype of the black male sexual prowler. Then the same Fontaine boy kills Jonas Wilkinson for telling blacks men that they are equal to whites and that they are alowed to have white women!! He doesn't just kill him, he cuts him to ribbons with a knife. There are many more examples of this psychotic behaviour. And Mitchell treats them as if they are to be admired. While reading I kept thinking these people are all nuts. I was glad they suffered ... I lost any sense of caring about what happened to any of them, including Scarlett.Also, this is a very anti-American book. Mitchell keeps going on about how awful the Yankees and the Union and the federal government are and how great Georgia and states rights are. Of course, states rights here means being able to murder anyone who annoys you. The reconstruction section of the book should be read by everyone just to show why the flying of the Confederate flag is so offensive. It is completely un-American.And one last thing. This isn't a great love story. Rhett is really only a supporting character in the book until the last 200 pages when they get married, and for a book over 1000 pages, that's not alot. I think people remember the movie more than the actual book.I was really dissapointed with this book. I was looking forward to enjoying a nice read and discovered that it was horrible propaganda. It is really hard to believe that this book won the Pulitzer prize over Absalom,Absalom! by Faulkner.",
            "The book is better than the movie, and might be worth reading if you need an immense tome to take on vacation. Much as I despise this silly book, I have to admit it is a prime page turner.Its chief interest as a book is as a window into the viewpoint of history so common in the white upper crust South in the 1930's. The casually racist attitudes of Margaret Mitchell are a good example, and enough to make any quasi-enlightened being howl with outrage. Ditto the views on Andersonville, Reconstruction and especially the benefits of slavery to Black people.",
            "Well, I think Margaret Mitchell could have used a realy good editor. I don't mind reading long books quite the contrary I assure you, but well, one tiers of hearing yet another story about Scarlett doing something or another that gets her scorned by the people so they gossipe and Melly has to stop them. One time is enough!The story line for those few people who do not know it is the following: The young Scarlett O'Hara who is the favorit of all men falls in love with her friend Ashely Wilks who marries his cousin Melanie (Melly). Scarlett wants to hurt Ashley so she marrys his brother who soon after they are married dies in the war. Then Scarlett earns the scorne of the populus of Atlanta with her scandales behavior.Melly has a painfull childbirth and Scarlett takes her to Tara (her home) as the Yankkees march into Atlanta Georga. To Melly this kind act of careing for her wins her undieing respect.The story continues from here but I will not. The rest of the book centers around Scarlett and Rhett Butler and their feelings towareds eachother.I do not want to give the wronge impression it is not a bad book or even a book I disliked, it was great to read on the nine hour plane flight fom Budapest, but, after the plane ride was over and I still had 300 pages left I felt like I was wadding through quick sand to fininsh. If I had been on the plane for about 2 and a half more hours I would not feel this way but back home where I had so many other book to read I began to look at it as a waste of time. I am glad however that I have read it. Though I would have certenly looked at it in a more appeling light had it been hacked down about 300 pages.",
            "The book I received was not the illustrated version depicted, just a plain hardcover version. Could have bought that from someone else for half what I paid for this.",
            "Ok, so I'll say it. I hated the movie Gone with the Wind. But, in an effort to be fair, I decided to read the book. I thought maybe it was something about the production that I didn't like. But, no, the book has many of the same problems.Reasons to Hate GWTW:1)It's endless for one, just like the movie. Over a thousand pages and a large bit of it is completely unecessary.2) Rhett - I don't care what anyone says, he wasn't handsome, he wasn't romantic, and there wasn't much to like about him.3) Scarlett - I've never seen a more annoying female lead. And everyone says, \"oh she grows up in the end! she stops being selfish!\" She doesn't.4) If you don't like the two main characters, what's the point?Needless to say, it was a waste of money for me and I gave my copy to a friend who loves the movie. At least she'll enjoy it.",
            "It was a very well written book but everyone told me this was a good romance book. It was not a romance book, a romance book is a book where both people love each other. Rhett loved Scarlett for most of the book, but Scarlett did not love Rhett so how was this romance?It was very good other than that though, I had trouble putting it down just to go to sleep. It is very well written and unlike some authors she actually puts in a lot of description.",
            "GONE WITH THE WIND is a book that deserved to win the Pulitzer prize for its well developed Characters and fine writing but PLEASE don't buy it as history.I see no reason to call the Atlanta citizens &quot;rare courage&quot; unless you mean half baked!The slaves -- yes for what they endured.The Union troops (Black and White) fighting to preserve the Union IN FREEDOM and President Lincoln who went through hell for the nation but NOT the Confederates who were only seeking their own advantage and trying to tear our nation apart to establish a slave empire.Sorry but facts are facts.",
            "It was a tale beautifully told.I just finished reading it,and I can't get out of it's spell.The tragic end is absolutely perfect. I'm a person who likes everything to be pleasant,and I expected the end to be a happy one - like Scarlett saying &quot;I love you!&quot; to Rhett and Rhett hugging her and saying he loved her too.I'm not dissappointed,just heart-broken.I didn't cry like one customer says she did,but still the odd feeling in my stomach won't go away yet.As I said,I just put down the book and it's great,even though it left a sinking feeling in my stomach. I can't figure how I can really be happy for an hour or so with this emotion left from the book. Let me tell you - this book is so powerful.I loved it.I feel sadness and pity for Scarlett.It's good that nothing like this really happened and it's just fiction.If you're sad,think like this - it's just a tale,not true,(even though it seems terribly real) and it just added things to your outlook on life and to your literature knowledge. You don't want to lose a moment of your life mourning over a tale that didn't even exist,and Scarlett wouldn't want you to. :)) So just smile,and let that smile be a grateful one to Margaret Michell.She really changed you,didn't she?",
            "I don't know if there is anything that Margaret Mitchell failed to put into this book. It is obvious that the author poured her entire being into this book and it is evident as you read that this story must have been very close to her heart as it always grabs hold of the hearts of countless readers. The book is written by an obvious historian and gives many details of the way of life of the people of the old south and the Civil War days as well. There is romance, a glimpse into the past, heartbreak, hope, triumph, struggle, life lessons, love, and the story of Scarlett O'Hara that will continue to live in the hearts of readers for generations to come. No matter what kind of books you like to read you will enjoy Gone with the Wind and take a piece of the book away with you for it never fails to leave one thinking about what the important things in life are.",
            "What a thumping good read! Unright-on and politically incorrect it may be, but frankly my dear... This book contains all things horrid - racism, slavery, going for your best friend's man (and your sister's!), cruelty to animals and unfortunates, deforestation, to name but a few. But so what? The characters are so strong they could be placed in any walk of life and flourish. OK, maybe not that insipid piscean-like Ashley Wilkes, but he should've been drowned at birth anyhow! How Scarlett could've been gagging for him for any longer than a couple of weeks is a mystery to me, but I guess he was a challenge (no wonder Rhett felt inadequate!). To be fair, the book does goes on a bit in parts, and I feel Margaret Mitchell could've employed her journalistic skills and been a little more succinct. There are a number of characters that I see no need for and having seen the film so many times, I believe she could have honed her dialogue more. But Mags is so much kinder to Scarlett than Victor Fleming is in the movie. On film Scarlett is portrayed as a ball-breaker - which to a certain extent she most commendably is! - whereas in the book we see her thought processes and we understand why she is like she is. She's a tough cookie who is simply unprepared to have nothing 'coz her contemporaries harp on about honour and the good old days. She's MOVIN'! Plus in the book we see a far darker Rhett than the role interpreted by Clark Gable. He's cool, he's a bad boy, he's loaded, but let's face it, the guy's got problems! He knew what he was getting into when he met Ms O'Hara, but he still pursued her for years. He's got some gall to turn round and moan that she isn't the way he wanted her to be, believing he could have changed her and made her love him. And then when she discovers it for herself... well Scarlett, the game's over! I'm not interested anymore. But hey, we still love him, he still packs a punch more than Frank, Charles and that stupid Ashley and he keeps you guessing. Does she get him back? Probably eventually. Scarlett has screwed up by being such a foolhardy hothead, but give her a break! With Melanie gone, she's got no pals and you know Scarlett will honour her promise and look out for Ashley... urgh! With any luck the man will get abducted by aliens and everyone can get on with their lives!",
            "Set in the Civil War era in Georgia, Margaret Mitchell's runaway classic Gone With the Wind is the spellbinding historical fiction of the world's best-known southern belle Scarlett O'Hara and the infamous Rhett Butler. The book was later made into one of the most successful films in history, starring Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable as the love-to-hate main characters. Normally, one would despise a person so spoiled and selfish as Scarlett, but Margaret Mitchell writes the emerald-eyed belle and the other characters in the book as multi-faceted, understandable characters, all with surprisingly human emotions and interactions. Through all of her struggles in the course of the novel, Scarlett stays strong, and in the end her will survives and she concludes a strong woman hopeful of what tomorrow will bring. Gone With the Wind is magnificent in its entirety, so complete with accurate historical facts and an unpredictable plot. The narrator follows Scarlett through years of her life, pre-, neo- and post- civil war, building at a quick pace. Scarlett rises again after the deaths of many close to her, after her failed marriage to Rhett, after going home to her beloved plantation of Tara during Reconstruction to find everything gone, and after her unrequited love for Ashley. The book closes with Scarlett pronouncing the famous words, &quot;After all, tomorrow is another day!&quot; Poignant and absolutely enchanting, Gone With the Wind is a book I would recommend to anyone. It cannot be guaranteed that you will enjoy it as I did, but from reading this novel you will gain insight about a true struggle and eventual survival.",
            "I recently downloaded the book, `Gone With The Wind' to my Kindle. It's not because I haven't read the book - far from it! Like millions of readers world-wide, I have already savoured every page of this best-selling listed book of all time in hardback, at least twice so far. I was 6 years old when my grandmother first noticed me looking intently at her copy of `Gone With The Wind' in her bookcase. And it was shortly after my grandmother passed away a few months later that the very same book was placed gently into my hands to keep (as was her request).There have been so many book reviews about `Gone With The Wind', authored by Margaret Mitchell, that I was almost tempted not to write this review. It seems somewhat pointless in repeating what has already been written countless times about this masterpiece, and the only book ever published by this author in 1936, who received a Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for it, in 1937. With over 30 million sales, a film, and sequel attempts by other authors in attempts to keep the `Gone With The Wind' saga alive, it is a book well known, world-wide.For those unfamiliar; set in the state of Georgia, southern United States in 1861, `Gone With The Wind' is the story of the high spirited, un-conforming southern belle Scarlett O'Hara and her tumultuous struggles of the heart, with (southern gentleman) Ashley Wilkes and (charming rogue) Rhett Butler. But it is not just a romance novel; it is also a novel bathed in American history, and the story of a young woman's determination and strength of will to save her beloved plantation home called Tara in any way possible, through times of the American Civil War and the early years of Reconstruction.I cannot recall why I was so captivated by this book when I looked at it on my grandmother's book shelf all those years ago (it did not have a colourful outside cover). I certainly wasn't at an age to fully comprehend the contents of it, despite the fact that as a child growing up in the Australian bush in the 1960's, reading was a huge part of my childhood, especially as my mother and grandmother were both teachers. However, once I read the book I realised that my grandmother would have known I would relate to Scarlett's love of the land; her home, Tara, which she fought to protect at any cost.My favourite excerpts:-Gerald O'Hara (Scarlett's father): `'Do you mean to tell me, Katie Scarlett O'Hara, that Tara, that land doesn't mean anything to you? Why, land is the only thing in the world worth workin' for, worth fightin' for, worth dyin' for, because it's the only thing that lasts.''\"Somewhere, on the long road that wound through those four years, the girl with her sachet and dancing slippers, had slipped away, and there was left a woman with sharp green eyes, who counted pennies and turned her hands to many menial tasks, a woman to whom nothing was left from the wreckage, except the indestructible red earth on which she stood.\"`Gone With The Wind' will appeal to readers for so many different reasons. I highly recommend it!J M Lennox",
            "Oh wow!! I was utterly and completely engrossed with this book. Mitchell did an incredible job on being very descriptive of everything. As I read I can really picture the scenery, the characters, and the war especially. Scarlet annoyed me and it was devastating how selfish, cruel, and cold hearted she was. Nevertheless, I couldn't put the book down. I was interested to see on what would become of her and Rhett, and Melanie and Ashley. The ending was a tear jerker for me especially for what happened to Melanie. The author did well on creating so much depth into this novel. Don't be intimidated by the long and many pages of this book. It was worth reading.",
            "Saying you know the story of \"Gone With the Wind,\" because you've seen the movie is like saying you know Kansas from watching \"The Wizard of Oz.\" Compressed and with composite characters, the brilliant movie doesn't hold a candle to the novel upon which it is based. The novel has undergone much criticism, for black dialect (which we studied, along with other dialects in History of the English Language), for rosy portrayals of slavery, and for being a forbidden romance that happens to have the Civil War as its background.\"Gone With the Wind,\" is more than a novel; it is an experience. Scarlett O'Hara is devout with faith---in herself, and is a survivor. The true tragedy of the book is that she is blinded by her ignorance into ignoring true love when it was present, and longing after an idealized love with a married friend. The book is lush with descriptions of the period, and very accurate in its detail. Scarlett is externally strong, with fragile emotions, while her foil Melanie Hamilton Wilkes is internally strong, with character and devotion that run deep. Ashley Wilkes is rather pathetic in that he never has the integrity to admit a lust for his childhood friend Scarlett but not romantic love, while Rhett, in many ways like Scarlett, and older and wiser, loves her for who she really is, not the face that society of the time demands she show in public. The story is mostly about character development in the face of tragedy, and shows three survivors with one \"displaced person,\" forever malcontent in the new world that the War has created, out of place, sad, and futile.A word about the slavery element: slavery was NOT a good thing. Not all slaves were named after their owners or treated as trusted members of the family or confidantes. Aside from Rhett, Mammy is the only person who knows Scarlett, what she is capable of, and chastises her for her lack of morals or values. I feel her character is critiqued based upon her speech patterns, not her actual actions. With the exception of Prissy, none of the African-Americans appear to be ridiculed or used for comic effect, nor do stereotypes surface. Pork, Dilcey, Mammy, and Prissy are fortunate that the emotional ties they shared with the O'Haras continued so much that they remain as paid staff after being freed. Cruelty from others is also depicted, usually in the form of Northerners who didn't understand the way of life.What remains is a tale of what happens when one's way of life and world are turned upside down, and how the principal character handles it, and relates with the others, failing at times to recognize the quality of friendship from her sister-in-law Melanie and the weakness of Ashley Wilkes. I quite wonder if Mittie Bulloch Roosevelt felt this way, when the enchanting Clayton County belle (from whom some of Scarlett's physical traits seem drawn) moved to New York State with new husband Theodore Roosevelt, Sr.While not all elements of the novel are positive, GWTW is a snapshot album of life during the Civil War and Reconstruction.",
            "In my humble opinion, Gone with the Wind is THE great American novel. It is brilliant, incredibly well-written, and highly enjoyable to read. It is at times charming, romantic, or bitingly funny, and at other times dark, cold, or heartbreaking. And always, it has the Civil War-era history as its dramatic backdrop. Its characters are fascinating and complex, though FAR from perfect. This book has everything, and its appeal is timeless.I first read the book as a young girl, after a couple of friends at school has been reading it and were enthralled by it when we were all about 13. I read it starting one Christmas break, and could hardly put it down. It's such a long epic, yet so fast-paced, that you just become lost in it. That's the very best way to enjoy a novel- to just become fully engrossed. The way it worked out for me was perfect too, because when I read it that first time, I had never seen the movie. (My parents had probably watched it a few times when I was little, since they love the movie, but I was too young to pay much attention). I knew nothing about the characters or storyline before reading it, and that just made it all the better. Of course, at that age I loved Rhett Butler and the love story aspect the most! Some of it was over my head or too \"worldy\" for me to understand then. Realizing this, I have since read the book again as an adult (I'm now in my late 20's and have seen the movie several times also). I loved the book just as much as the first time around, and certainly as an adult I got much more out of the historical elements, descriptions of the countryside, and the whole storyline.I would really encourage anyone who has only seen the movie to read the book. I do love the movie; It was incredible for its time, and is a classic itself; but to me it doesn't even compare to the book. Just watching the movie, you only get a sense of the most shallow outline of the story, without understanding much of its depth, character development, or wit. This is especially true in the second half, which was a bit rushed in the movie.A slight pet peeve of mine: Some people comment on Gone With the Wind being \"racist\" or \"sexist,\" as if that somehow detracts from its quality. Quite the contrary...Not only is that overstating the obvious, that's part of the point!! OF COURSE the characters' racist viewpoints were condescending and horrible. But they were historically realistic. The entire nation of the 19th century was shamelessly racist, especially aristocracy in the deep South, and this story is told from their point of view. Why read classic literature or historic fiction at all, if the past must be sugar-coated for modern sensibilities? There is nothing to be learned from that. OF COURSE some of the attitudes toward ladies seem old-fashioned now. That goes without saying. But that is part of its charm and helps to explain why Scarlett is as conniving as she is. She's no fool! The Old South had its faults and cruelties (namely slavery) but largely as a result of those faults, it also did not survive. GWTW portrays this fall. Thus, there is so much to be learned from the book, historically and morally. Its very brilliance is the way it captures a snapshot of that long-lost culture, from its most beautiful and genteel qualities to its faults that ended up being its downfall, and portrays it changing with the war. The Old South is \"gone with the wind\" but will forever be alive in the pages of this great American novel.Margaret Mitchell depicts the Southerners as what they were: just people, same as the Yankees, trying to defend their own and to sacrifice and to courageously fight for their side as they thought was right, in their stubbornly proud way. And after, when they had been humbled, they were trying to just pick up the pieces and survive, in a cruelly war-ravaged land. The only world they had ever known was ripped out from under them. Gone with the Wind follows Scarlett and our fictional storyline as it parallels every step of the historic timeline, through Reconstruction.In so many ways, Scarlett herself is like the South. In my mind, I feel like she represents the South. As the final page of the book describes, in one of my favorite lines: \"......With the spirit of her people who would not know defeat even when it stared them in the face, she raised her chin. She could get Rhett back.\"",
            "There's probably nothing I can say about Gone With the Wind that hasn't already been said, but I'm going to put in a plug for it anyway, because it's an incredible book and because a large number of people (most probably haven't read it) just don't get it--I'm talking particularly about those who think it's a romance novel.Gone With the Wind is incredible for its value as historical fiction. Written in the early 20th century by an author who grew up hearing stories about the Civil War and Reconstruction, it recreates that era far more successfully than any modern-day writer could. I've lived most of my life within a half-day's drive of Atlanta, but had never heard the South's perspective in the Civil War laid out as it is here. Some have complained that the book is racist, but to me, that's part of the point. This is no whitewashed, modern-day version of what Southerners thought in the 1860s; instead, it's a priceless and sometimes surprising reproduction of what they really thought and how that culture (very different from today's South!) operated.Aside from the beautiful portrayals of the people, places and events of the time period, there's some good action--those turned off by long books will be surprised at how readable this one is. The main characters, like them or hate them, are well-developed. And, yes, they have love lives. But then, we're modern readers, even if Scarlett isn't, so we should be used to that, right?",
            "I read this book as a little girl of nine or ten. Then I reread it and reread it until I practically had it memorized. No other book has affected me like this, and I've read many other books, including many of the great classics of literature. I have yet to find another Gone With the Wind.This book is life changing. To those who dismiss it as sexist racist trash, I would argue this: If describing reality as it is is sexist and racist, perhaps that simply reflects that there is a great deal of sexism and racism in reality. Were the people of the South prior and after the Civil War racist? Yes. Of course. Were these sexist times? Yes. Does it glorify sexism and racism.Perhaps. It is only fair to give this last question some consideration. There are sentiments in this book that are racist. I think of the feelings expressed of longing for the old days, the days of slavery, expressed by the main characters. But these are certainly feelings that were held by the people who clung so steadfastly to that way of life.I do not agree that all of the African Americans were portrayed as stupid. Even Prissy, in her own way, was not stupid. She was a detestable character, black or white, but not necessarily stupid, just daydreamy. But Mammy is anything but stupid. She certainly has a greater understanding of Scarlett than Scarlett's own mother ever did.Sexist?I don't know if this makes me a \"sexist\" but I have never identified with a character as much as I did Scarlett. It was as if I were reading the thoughts in my own head. She is manipulative, headstrong, stubborn, narcissistic, a dreamer, a romantic, and ultimately a realist, who stays in reality, and stays strong by clinging to certain rocks as her world changes around her. Rocks like her farm, Tara. And I love that. I love that when everything else is blown away from her, she clings to the things she learned to value in her childhood. \"Land,\" her father had told her, \"Land is the only thing worth fighting for.\"This book has given me strength throughout my life. I don't cling to the land, because I have none to cling to. But I cling to the things that give me a sense of something permanent and unchanging in my world, and especially when times seem unstable, and change seems to ruthlessly rip out all the familiar structures I have around me.",
            "It's hard to believe that I'd never read GWTW. I've seen the film multiple times and I know a bit about the history of the novel. _Gone With the Wind_ sold more than 1,000,000 copies in the six months after it was released in 1936, and a year later Mitchell was awarded the Pulitzer prize for her effort. It's certainly one of the best-loved books of our century, with fans ranging from feminists who are trying to reclaim Scarlett to groups like the United Daughters of the Confederacy.So when I picked up the book, my biggest question was whether or not it was worth so much fuss and adoration. I suppose that my answer has to be 'yes'. Mitchell's writing style is occasionally uneven and it took me 50 pages to get used to her diction, but the story is so sweeping and the characters so well-realized that all concerns about style and tone were lost in the experience of the book.In many ways, I found the book a much stronger story than emerges in the film. Unhampered by censorship, the world that Scarlett moves in in the book is much uglier than the one in the film-- painful miscarriages, brothels, wounds and poverty fill Mitchell's picture of the post-war south and make Scarlett's character much stronger and much less petulant than she emerges in the film.Although daunting in length, I found that the pages literally flew by, and I was sorry in the end when the story closed. Definitely a 'should read'.",
            "Unlike the movie, this book is NOT a \"romance novel\"; it's a hard-hitting account of Southern life during the Civil War, told from a Southern point of view, told as if from the period. The racist attitudes of the time, though naturally, entirely unsavory from today's point of view, existed, and denying it won't erase the facts. Mitchell WASN'T trying to make a statement of ANY kind, pro or con; she merely wrote on how things were, as opposed to how one wished they might be, or wished them to be different. The dichotomies between black and white life are entirely realistic, and to portray them as anything otherwise would be foolhardy. The only way to know how ghastly our history was in terms of its treatment of humanity is to preserve the facts as they were, and this book, without even trying, does exactly that.Too, it would be a serious mistake to paint this book as an idyllic, romantic love story. Mitchell, to her credit, does not fall back on dime-store novel clich&eacute;s, and unfortunately, she is rarely accorded respect for this. Because of the movie, an entirely different, not altogether flattering, slant permeates the whole \"Gone With The Wind\" phenomenon - and which debased Mitchell's intentions in the appalling Alexandra Ripley sequel.If everyone who saw the film had read the book, realization might be more widespread as to how they differ, and how much more complex and sharply drawn are the characters.Scarlett and Rhett are two unapologetic opportunists who are startlingly lacking in typical \"storybook\" appeal. Instead, their \"appeal\" is in how earthy and shrewd they both are, survivors by discarding public approval and approbation. In the end, both are humbled (\"redeemed\" is too strong a word) by life and their chronic misunderstanding of each other - and wind up, naturally, alone. Mitchell, shrewdly enough, in a rare move of unsentimentality, does not go the \"happily ever after\" route - Rhett leaves Scarlett, ruthlessly, abruptly. How could Butler, after being so shabbily treated, retain his self-respect by staying with Scarlett? All the other characters are drawn with wonderful strokes of originality and vividness - human, flawed and far more appealing than the pastel versions portrayed in the film.Mitchell was an incredible vernacular writer, and her skills in doing so emphasized the differences between all the cultures, classes and races. Astonishing is Mitchell's ability to combine history, social commentary and fiction with unbelievable ease; after several hours of reading, the reader may feel as though he had been in a virtual time machine, so indelibly detailed are the locales, weather, sounds and even smells. Even more absorbing are the marvelous dialogues between the characters, especially those of Rhett and Scarlett. Mitchell had a grasp as to how humans interact through words, and unlike, say, Ayn Rand, the conversations sound as if they are spoken by real people.Finally, though, for those who thought that Mitchell was Olde-Tyme in her attitudes and conventions because she was able to depict them so vividly, I suggest the reader pay close attention to the character of Rhett Butler, and his disdain for Old South values. Mitchell pulled a fast one by revealing, through Butler's character, just how modern a thinker she was. Butler repeatedly upbraids Scarlett for her early adherence to an antiquated \"value system\" and mockingly scorns the society around him. He sees what a sham and fakery of all the conventions that exist, and of having to accede to a mass-mentality. Through Rhett Butler, Mitchell slyly tucks in her own incredibly multi-faceted, intellectually-based mindset.Mitchell's book is one of the true greats in American novels.",
            "What can I add that has not already been said about this novel? It truly is one of the best novels ever written. I read over 75 books every year, many of them historical novels. I don't know why I waited so long to read this one, but I'm glad I finally did. And no, I haven't seen the movie. The characters were multi-dimensional and despite their often-displayed negative qualities, we keep hoping for them. They are more real and probably like ourselves than most of us would care to admit. Perhaps that is the real beauty of the story. We can see how selfish actions can lead to consequences without having to live through the pain ourselves. The style is easy to read and enjoyable to follow. And the backdrop of the Civil War and the early reconstruction period (from the South's point of view) is among the best I've ever run across. Despite its length, the book keeps you enthralled, every step of the way. This is one of those classics that you simply must read, not because you should, but because you will be so glad you did.",
            "The book was excellent, however it was missing page 713. It had page 813 in its place. Therefore the book had page 813 displayed twice in the book. I also went to a local bookstore and noticed all 4 books by this publisher had the same problem.",
            "Does anybody not already know the story? Well just in case, be warned there are spoilers ahead.First, let's get this out of the way: Margaret Mitchell's \"Gone With the Wind,\" a story of the Civil War and Reconstruction in Georgia, is racist, and it paints a falsely idyllic portrait of slavery. There's no getting around it. Blacks are depicted as the functional equivalent of small children or draft animals who are best off under the loving care and protection of their white masters. They fulfill a narrative role similar to that of the dog Enzo in \"The Art of Racing In the Rain,\" devoted servants who are sometimes loyal to the point of heroism, and occasionally wise observers of their owners. Slave owners are kindly taskmasters, willing to spend thousands of dollars to buy slaves they don't need from other plantations to keep families together, loath to use harsh words or inflict discipline, and generously concerned with their slaves' physical and spiritual welfare. Slaves laugh in their cozy cabins and have comfortable clothes, plentiful food and attentive medical care. The \"better class\" of slaves recognize how good they have it and stay with their masters after the Emancipation Proclamation. Abolitionists are ignorant outsiders who don't want anything to do with black people and who can't even imagine the family feeling masters share with their slaves. You can make all the excuses you want about where Margaret Mitchell was from, the stories she heard as a child, and prevailing attitudes when this book was published in the 1930s. I know of no other American novel of comparable \"classic\" status that contains such a sustained portrayal of slave owner benevolence and black inferiority.That said, and I don't think these concerns are small matters, \"Gone With the Wind\" works brilliantly as a popular novel. To be sure, it has its flaws. If you like minimalism, you will find much of the prose overripe. There are more characters and scenes than are strictly necessary, even allowing for the vast historic scope of the story. I could do with a bit less wallowing in the red clay soil of north Georgia. The operatically star-crossed romance of Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara does not bear too close inspection.GWTW works so well nonetheless because Margaret Mitchell is touched with genius when it comes to structure, pacing, and characterization. As another reviewer put it, she has incisive insight into the human heart. She also has the good sense to leave her readers guessing all the way to the end. We can each draw our own conclusions as to whether Scarlett will get Rhett back. Aspiring novelists and novelists who want to write better novels would do well to study GWTW regularly.Reading this book again for the first time in decades, after many heart-fluttering trips through as a dreamy, lonely adolescent girl, I was floored by Mitchell's skill at setting scene after scene that grabs the reader's attention, drives the story forward, and tempts you to read \"just one more\" until the clock is ticking into the small hours of the morning and the sky through the crack in the window blind slips from black to gray. Mitchell's prose flows (sorry, cliche ahead) like a clear, swift-moving stream. It's not the highest art, but it's miles above most popular fiction.The characters, archetypes though they may be, are as vividly alive as any I can remember. Even before I re-read GWTW, I could, from memory, have told you all about Scarlett's childish willfulness, shrewd business acumen, lack of insight, fierce love of the land and insane commitment to keeping her word. I'd forgotten her occasionally touching acts of kindness, such as when, after her father dies in a riding accident, she gives his gold watch to his body servant, Pork, with no visible ulterior motive. I could have told you about Melanie's steely gentility, Ashley's dreamy weakness, Mammy's wisdom, Gerald O'Hara's sweet madness, and Ellen O'Hara's suicidal devotion to duty as she saw it. Rhett Butler is a wonderfully complex, infuriating character whose conflicts and sorrows come from his being a gentleman (at least by the standards of his culture) in spite of his own better judgment. The fact that people react so strongly to Scarlett, Rhett and the rest, favorably or not, is testament to Mitchell's having made them so real that we believe in them even when our rational minds suggest we do otherwise.Mitchell does a remarkable job capturing universal human emotions and frailties: the fearful, loving relationship a small child has with his mercurial mother, the wisdom that there can be happiness only when like marries like, the stubborn folly of romantic regret, the pain and blame that come to a couple when a beloved child dies, or the inability to see others as they really are, whether it's the strength of steel under a genteel, innocent exterior or a vulnerable, devoted heart lurking behind a sardonic facade.Every tragedy needs its comic relief. A seldom-noted feature of GWTW is Mitchell's humor. She directs a sharp wit at the hypocrisy of Old Guard Atlanta and affectionate humor at the child characters she, a childless woman herself, handles with such insight and aplomb.Pat Conroy's introduction does a nice job as far as it goes in explaining how GWTW shaped the inner lives of generations of women, especially Southern women and how it will always be popular in countries that lost a war. Beyond that, I think GWTW's popularity endures in spite of its cringe-inducing attitudes for a couple of reasons. First, it's an early story of female self-sufficiency. Driven by fear of poverty, aided by a sharp mind, a solid work ethic and scruples that are none too fine, Scarlett makes her own money. Not for her the ladylike impoverished widow's pursuits of millinery, baking, or boardinghouse operation, or the unladylike pursuit of a brothel. Instead, she goes into the building trades, buying and running lumber mills, competing as sharply as any man in the business. Second, it's a quintessentially American story of, as Mitchell herself put it, \"gumption.\" In the world of GWTW, anyone with enough gumption can triumph over any adversity. GWTW reflects something so deeply ingrained in the American psyche that it will have an audience as long as anybody anywhere believes in the American archetype of the self-made person.In spite of its flaws, GWTW deserves its place in the top rank of popular fiction.",
            "When I was in middle school I shared my locker with my best friend. Her favorite movie and book were Gone With the Wind, we had posters in the locker and she talked about it non-stop. I looked at it, saw how long it was and laughed at her for her obccession.Now as a senior in college I decided to pick it up and see what all the fuss was about. I don't have a lot of time to read during the semester, but I had this book finished in less then 3 weeks. I didn't want to put it down, and it ate at me during classes to not know what was going on in Atlanta in my absence.This is quite possibly the most amazing book I have ever read. Mitchell's writting style is amazingly easy to read dispite the era she was writing during, and her descriptions make the state of Georgia come alive for a girl who has never left New England.The character of Scarlett both infuriated me and drew commanalities to myself. While sometimes you want to scream at the book and make her realize her love for Rhett hundreds of pages before she does, I think theres a little of every women in her. Her hopes and fears are still very real so many years later.I am so happy to have read this book, and now its one I'll reread in a few years. I highly reccamend it and am completely in love with it.",
            "This book was wonderful. I love reading about the south and the Civil War era is a wonderful back drop for the story of the spoiled southern belle Scarlett, and the dashing Rhett. I personally feel that this book is the mother of historical romance and will last the test of time. I read this book the first time when I was 12 or 13 and re-read it again as an adult. My memory of this story was not altered by the length of time between these reads.Better then the movie and wonderfully descriptive with real characters that grow as a result of their experiences you will not be disappointed with this book.",
            "Roseywater, I don't like this book because it is racist. According to your \"racist\" point of view we all should consider that the Odissey is not a good work because it is also racist, we shouldn't like \"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\" because it is racist, we shouldn't like \"The Great Gatsby\" because it is classist, etc, etc, etc.You should leave out that way of criticism and appreaciate the essence of human relations that surfaces in this wonderful story. The book is not racist, some characters are. But remember this is a book that explores how people were in the 1860s in the Southern US and it would be unrealistic if some characters, or many of them, were not portrayed as racist.",
            "5+ stars! I have read Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind 3 times over my 60 years and it still ranks in my top 2 greatest books ever written. It is an American Masterpiece. A classic of its time. Epic in scope, it is simply a good story that you never want to end. Happy, sad, contrite, vengeful, mean, loving, mysterious, hypocritical; yes, it has all the human emotions and foibles of life and more. To borrow a line from Charles Dickens' Tale of Two Cities: \"It was the best of times, it was the worst of time\", but most of all it was their times.One of the vary best books ever written concerning character development. Ms. Mitchell was superb. Her use of emotion and empathy made the characters come alive and it was as if they were in the room with you.To say more about this wonderful American classic would be redundant and hyperbole.It is an absolute must read. A true American classic masterpiece.*Note: I have seen the movie many times and it too is an American classic. Stunning in character portrayal and scenery. BUT, the book has the broad scope and in-depth character development that the movie could never portray unless it was many hours longer. Simply put, The book Rules!!",
            "Thirty plus years ago, I lived and breathed \"Gone With the Wind\" in one huge, invigorating, life-changing gulp. I am writing this review because there is a whole new generation out there that should be exposed to this ground-breaking book.Epic in scope at over 1,000 pages, \"Gone With the Wind\" is a story of the Civil War, set in the deep South. The central charater is the infamous Scarlett O'Hara, a tempestuous, beautiful southern belle who secretly loves Ashley Wilkes, a childhood friend who marries his saintly cousin Melanie. At their engagement barbeque, Scarlett meets the dashing, mysterious Rhett Butler, the black sheep of a distinguished Charleston family. This event marks the last day of their antebellum lives, and sets the stage for the ravages of war that follow. Covering a time frame of roughly twelve years, \"GWTW\" is also a story of the new South that rises from the ashes of the old.Scarlett, one of the most indelible characters of modern fiction, is ruthless and selfish, a survivor and a fighter. A feminist long before her time, Scarlett pays dearly for the choices she makes. Rhett is a more complex individual with one weakness. He hides his love for Scarlett, prefering to pop in and out of her life until he \"catches her between husbands\". It is Rhett who is the more sympathetic character, deeply intelligent, self-mocking and sometimes heartbreakingly sad. Rhett, in spite of his worldly ways, is more representative of the old south, while Scarlett depicts the new.\"Gone With the Wind\" is fabulously well-written, plotted and researched. It has been criticized as racist, and it is so. No author today could get away with these portrayals of African Americans. But you have to remember that this book was written in the 1930s. Keep that in mind if you become angry. Personally, I feel that Mammy is one of the strongest, noblest women to appear in a work of fiction.This work is a must read for everyone. Savor it, reread it and be moved as many before you have been.",
            "This book probably has more reviews written for it than any other that I've seen on the Amazon site. As I said, I don't know what I can add that others haven't already said...but I have often thought, as I have read and re-read this wonderful novel, that I don't think Scarlett would get Rhett back in the end. I always thought Rhett was far more intelligent, well-rounded, and wise than she, and that an awful lot of his longing for her was comprised of her lack of availability (her heart, that is, that heart that belonged only to Ashley), and her looks. After all, when did he fall for her? When he looked up at her on the staircase and she was wearing that low-cut green-sprigged dress!The fascinating characters that Mitchell so deftly brings to life are what make this novel so unforgettable. I don't know that any of them are truly believable, but somehow that doesn't matter. The writing style is dated (all those exclamation points!), and of course the dialect and political viewpoints are atrocious in this day and age. The amazing thing is that none of this matters as we find ourselves caught up in Scarlett's world, a world, as Mitchell so poignantly writes,that was gone with the wind.When Rhett tells Scarlett at the end, \"I won't be pursued as the luckless Ashley was pursued,\" I believe he meant it. The fact that he could coin a phrase like, \"Someone or something has convinced you that your lover is too large a piece of Dead Sea fruit for even you to chew\" (not sure if I'm quoting this 100% correctly, but I've memorized large portions of the dialogue through re-reading) simply showcases how much more extensive his intellect is than Scarlett's. He realizes now that she no longer holds any appeal for him; her charm for him, simply, was her unattainable-ness. (not a word, either - sorry!)I never read the sequel. To me, that would be a sacrilege. Mitchell always said that for her, the novel ended when it ended. But no one who reads it can resist pondering...\"Did she get him back?\" And I say no.But read it anyway. It's a long read, but oh, such an enjoyable one.",
            "This book is now my favorite book of all time (it contends with the Bible people!) and is the reason I am grateful to have sight and the ability to read, to enjoy masterpieces like this. I will admit the first 100 pages were slightly slow, but necessary to build the story. I loved learning more about the Civil War and appreciated seeing it from a perspective that often gets shrouded in history. Slavery was never ok but this book allowed me to explore slavery from the South's point of view. I also loved Scarlet, even with all her downfalls, and enjoyed the book most all when Rhett was highlighted.Every American should be required to read this book! That is how passionately I loved it.Also, the un-sequel Scarlet was a lovely read. Some contest that Mitchell's work should have been left alone and I can see their point. However, I wasn't ready to say good-bye to Scarlet just yet. No, the sequel does not quite compare to the original, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend the sequel to those who secretly want a happier ending for Scarlet.",
            "GWTW-I discovered it on the shelf of my highschool library & having never heard of it, I decided I would read it. I was completely unprepared for the ride! While we all want to be Melanie, the truth is-we're all a little Scarlett on the inside! I have since read the book many times (and of course own the DVD) and never tire of it. A definite book for gals-you get a glimpse into southern life at the time of the Civil War and experience a love story of enormous preportions. \"Fiddle Dee Dee\" is our catch phrase around the house! LOVED IT>",
            "Do yourself a favor and order Gone with the Wind now. Just make sure you have a lot of time to devote to this book, because once you start reading it, you won't be able to stop. Margaret Mitchell's classic is a fantastic, almost hypnotizing read and Scarlett O'Hara is one of the best --if not the best-- characters in American fiction of all time.",
            "well, english is not my mother tongue but I speak it well enough to love this book. Maybe I'm not completely objective since I have seen the movie for about 10 time before I had read the book (this means I'm crazy about the movie) but still some things are slightely different then they are portrayed in the movie. First of all, there are a lot of characters that the film does not mention (which are quite important, but still, does not change the point) and the book is a lot more unfair I might say, to the slaves (only after reading I realized why there are, if any, contoversies surrounding GWTW phenomenon). They are often portrayed as silly, not so bright people (although very, very lovely and loving) and in the movie they are very smart, prudent people that often help when white people couldn't, that often show more courage and intelligence then the wihite people do and that's why I like them better portrayed in the film. But the things why I absolutely love GWTW, love between Rhett and Scarlett and deep friendship between Scarlett and Melanie, stay the same. So, all in all, I truly recommend this book first of all, to all the GWTW fans (because they CAN'T go wrong with reading it) and then to all the others who'd like to find out thing or two about how things were back in the old South, meet really great characters that are above all, believable and convincing and read about the greatest love story of our time, as it's been said on the covers.",
            "I loved this book but the end reduced me to tears. And Rhett ,Rhetts character made me love him literally love him like Scarlett did lin the end. When I was reading this book I felt like I was Scarlett and when he said he did not love her I felt like he was saying that to me . I'm sad that Margaret Mitchell died before she could make the sequel because I fell in love with Rhett ! My heart is empty right now . Oh Rhett ! By: Heart Broken",
            "Amazing peice of work, and should be read by everyone. This is the best written novel I have ever read, and probably will be the ebst written novel I will ever read in my lifespan. This book has so much detail, the way the characters are described are almost impossible to compare to any book written. Not only is this an epic, but I find it to be a historical epic; it navigates through the years, when the civil war started (or months before it began), through the civil war, the end and the reconstruction. The reconstruction is something that is not ever really written about, and the novel actually depicts what the south is going through after the civil war.Some people might find Scarlett, to be selfish and well...a bitch. But I loved her! Wither her the entire story wouldn't work! I found her love over ashley to be rather mezmerizing, who would spend years after someone, and into three marriages?Scarlett! I thought the most detailed part, were the settings especially rhett's and Scarlett's dream home, talk about having a nice mansion!",
            "Gone with the Wind is an epic tale of a Southern belle, living through the time that was the Civil War. Scarlett O'Hara, a beautiful yet harsh young woman, is the female protaganist, and the story follows her journey, beginning in a time when all is well; the balls, the parties, the beaux. Her vindictive and manipulative nature pushes her to make a mistake or two, and she finds herself widowed soon after the war has started. The novel leads the audience through the abundance of obstacles Scarlett must endure, allowing the reader to sympathise with her during the lost love of Ashley Wilkes, the neglected love of Rhett Butler, and the terrible times she experiences throughout the war.Margaret Mitchell, despite the fact that Gone with the Wind is her first and only novel, narrates the story with an ease in both the plot and the dialogue, throwing the audience head first into a world where the negroes work for the white man, where war has broken out, and where it is innappropriate to wear a dress revealling your bosom in the morning.Compared to other anecdotes narrating stories of the Civil War, Gone with the Wind is not only a tear-jerker, but a tale that captures hearts, and fingers; leaving readers unable to put the book down.",
            "I love Gone with the Wind. I love the experience of reading it than watching the movie. The book has a lot of characters that were not part of the movie. For example, Scarlett O'Hara had a son with her first husband, the brother of Melanie Wilkes.Another example, in the movie, during the escape of Atlanta, Scarlett, Rhett Butler, Melanie and her baby, and a slave escaped the burning city. The book includes a small boy slave (I forgot his name) who accompanied them to Escape from Atlanta and he has a role who was known to complain and nag Scarlett.I love the movie, but the book is very detailed with each character, especially their personality and family background.",
            "Preceding the Civil War, talk in Atlanta is rife with apprehension and speculation that warfare lies in the near future. Gone with the Wind revolves around the initially idyllic existence of a belle, Scarlett O'Hara, her unsteady marriage with the scandalous Rhett Butler, and her unforeseen reality during the heart of the Civil War. The sentimental page-turner demonstrates inspiring courage, outrageous fervor, and dramatic life alterations, in an emotional episode...brought to life!",
            "The many adventures of a spoiled, vain, and annoying adolescent living in Georgia during the Civil War era. I read this book at least once yearly just for the mental time travel. Boy, could Margaret Mitchell paint a picture! I always feel as though I'm right on Peachtree Street with Scarlett O'Hara, and I never fail to get mad at her for losing Rhett. Everyone should try this at least once.",
            "Scarlett O' Hara has to be the most famous character ever written in all of literature. Her story about coming to age just when the Civil War began and having to learn everything she was taught is of no use to her during war and after war is a must read for anyone. Her transformation into a shrewd, lying and spoiled southern belle is just about the best for any reader who loves stories based on the southern way of life. I just have to say this book is not racist and it was never intended to be. Many people just think it is because now we are bombarded into thinking blacks are the victims of society due to them having been slaves. People this is the story of Scarlett O'Hara living in times when not many black people were educated. Some blacks were but many were not as the belief back then was that blacks were just not too smart to learn. Which we now know is not true. But one thing is true and what many of us now have to understand is that many blacks who were slaves did not want to be freed. Where were they going to go and what were they going to do after being free? What did they know about this strange land being freed? How were they going to survive? They didn't know and they didn't know anything about taking the intiative of oneself instead of being told what to do. And many blacks were defending the then southern way of living. Many slaves did love there slaveowners and wanted to remain with them. Many slaves did fight on the Confederate side willingly. Even when the south did lose the war many ex-slaves did stay with they're ex-slave owners because in they're way of thinking they still belonged to them. It was a mutual love. They did die fighting believing in the Confederate way of thinking. They were not brainwashed it was just they way of living that they knew. They loved there white folk like many Mammies did love there white kids as if they were they're own children. We have to remember that the way of thinking was completely different back then. We have to remember if that way of thinking was now we would think the same way. Love knows no barriers. The love of another to another is just that. Even if it meant a slave-owner loving his slave like a slave loved his owner. Didn't God have a commandment to treat your slave with respect and to give him his seventh year free. The bad people of this story were the carpetbaggers. They caused so much damage in this country back then that the states suffered it for years because of them. They lied to the ex-slaves by telling them to vote them into office and then wanting to have nothing to do with them. As Margaret Mitchell tells in the book many blacks were put into also. I read many books about this subject and it is true. The most ignorant and hateful towards white were put into office. They saw this as a way to get back at the whites for having them in slavery. But that is not it. Many slaves saw it as revenge because of the wrong done unto them by being slaves. What the carpetbaggers did was poison the minds of the ex-slaves by telling them it was wrong and it was wrong but they made them hate the whites by telling lies about how many whites ex-slaveowners beat, torture, and rape and commit atrocities against the blacks. Okay yes it did happen. But like many stories it was embellished. Only about a one percent of the whites did own plantations. Something we dont't believe but it is true. We have been taught that all whites back then were rich and made they're riches on the backs of blacks. That's not true. If it was then there would be more blacks in this country then there are whites. WE as a people of this time know our TIME only, meaning now or present time. We are a product of the liberal public education system. I mean we don't know our history or any other countries either. We love to embellish the past, everybody now who was of voting age swear up and down that they voted for Kennedy when he was running for the presidency. That is a complete lie. So everybody who now who is black (this is excluding the newly arrived black Africans) swear up and down they came from slaves. That is a lie also. Many black families immigrated into the US after the Civil War and after the nineteen hundreds. So many black people can't say they came from slaves. What I am saying is that the Jessie Jacksons and Al Sharptons of this world have poisoned many black people of this country to the point of wanting to hurt them and keep them enslaved in hatred towards the whites of this country. We should remember the civil war but not be embittered by it.",
            "What is the point of reviewing this book? Everyone knows that it is amazing - the movie won many Oscars and got 5 stars, a rare rating for a movie. I read this 1024 page-turner in about 1 month. It takes a little while to get into the story, but not long. Scarlett's character does get a little frustrating at times, you just want to yell at her so she understands!! But that's what makes this book a definite classic. There shouldn't be anybody in the world without this book on their bookshelves, and I mean anybody. And what is even better is owning an older version, or even a first edition! This book makes you want to know everything about it: the movie, the author, a sequel!! Speaking of that, there is &quot;Scarlett: The Sequel to Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind&quot; by Alexandra Ripley. I would definitely recommend that also, I'm about half way through it. Though the author is different, you get into her style quickly and fall back into the romance of Scarlett and Rhett. I would suggest saving the movie (if you haven't seen it) for after reading the book. A great summer read. Worth the $6!!!",
            "This is without a doubt the best book in the world! I loved the way Margret Mitchell made the charecters so realistic. If you don't read this book you will be missing out on alot. The ending however is heartbreaking. I have read this book a dozen times and it never gets boring. I love the witty remarks of Rhett. This is a book you don't want to miss out on.",
            "It was amazing to me how much I could love a book with so few admirable characters. (One wonders if the film, &quot;The War of the Roses&quot; might not have been contrived from the story of Rhett and Scarlett.) But in all of her rage, Scarlett's stength and determination still makes her an attractive character, and after all of her shenanigans, you still want her to win. When assessing the characters, it is important to remember that they lived in a society where they played by different rules, often rules difficult for us to understand (e.g. rules regarding what constitutes adultery; and unbending rules of loyalty that might otherwise escape many of us). But all in all, beauty seems only to be found in Melanie and Mammy; a pitiful sympathy for Ashley and the other fallen &quot;Old Guard&quot;; and a most certain feeling that, indeed, Scarlett and Rhett, deserved each other, pain and all.",
            "I always thought &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; would forever hold the title.But &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; may surpass it.As a damn yankee,I discovered I belong south of the Mason-Dixon line,where women are treated respectfully,parents are honored,loyalty to family and friends are boundless,and others postive traits exhibited,that are much too scarce today.Read this book and also find yourself wishing to protect and risk your life for Scarlett!",
            "I grew up watching the movie version of Gone With the Wind, and I first read the novel when I was in 9th grade. If you only see the movie, you miss out on so much. This story literally has a little of everything in it. Don't let the length scare you away-it is such an amazing book, don't miss out on it!",
            "This novel is acknowledged as one of, if not the best and most popular novels ever written. It deserves just that because of the universal appeal of its themes. The story starts with Scarlett O'Hara, a charming, determined but stubborn and proud Southern belle, trying to get the heart of Ashley Wilkes, who is to marry all-so-sweet and kind Melly, heartily hated by the leading lady. After over 1000 pages it ends with Scarlett realization that she really loves charming not such a gentleman Rhett Butler, who is also very proud and stubborn.In between the first and the last pages there are 12 years of Scarlett's life, from 16 to 28, Civil War, 3 marriages (the last of them is with Rhett Butler), 3 kids, wealth, poverty, and then wealth again, unseen love of Rhett Butler, death of all beloved, her maturity from a child into a woman, and finally the realization of the true priorities in her life. Unfortunately it is too late, they are all gone with the wind...",
            "This is a book that really made me think about human nature, about how we sometimes get stuck with an idea, a person or a memoire that no longer is what we think it is. Like Scarlet spending her life loving Ashley with all her heart, but what she really loved was an illusion, ironically the illusion of what Rhett truly was.",
            "There ae some books you read, love and remember forever. This was one of them. If you hesitate to read this just because it is such a popular book, or you think that it's a romance novel, DON'T. I read it a couple years ago, well after I was out of highschool. I didn't think that I would care for it. Boy, was I wrong.I was hooked just a couple pages into the book. I felt like I knew these people. I could not put the book down. It was one of those books you just can't wait to read and you drag it with you wherever you go, in hopes of being able to sneak in a page or two.Read this book. It will leave an imprint on you. I wanted so much to keep reading after it stopped that I tried to read the &quot;sequel&quot; (written by a different author) and was unimpressed. I returned the book after reading the first paraghraph. There's nothing like Margaret Mitchell's Scarlet.",
            "One of the icons of American Literature and deservedly so.First read this when I was a teenager and my friends and I would ooh and aah over the scene near the beginning where Scarlett was trying to decide what to wear to the party at Ashley's plantation.I read it every couple of years thereafter and as I grew and matured so did my appreciation of this magnificent book. I first became more aware of how detailed Mitchell's research about the Civil War must have been (no matter how biased she was) and this prompted me to read more books both fiction and non-fiction about that period.My next level of maturity was demonstrated by subsequent reads where I became more impressed with Mitchell's willingness to avoid a standard HEA. She never painted Scarlett as anything but what the character demanded: a spoiled debutante whose world had not only collapsed but was blown away forever by the \"wind\". Scarlett's true, unvarnished, bottom line goal in life became to ensure that she and her family would survive and so would that representation of survival - Tara. Compared to the mores of that lost civilization, she seemed to have fallen from grace. In reality, she, being so very young, came to understand which of the values and mores of that civilization were worth keeping and what were just superficial and ignorant societal expectations. Unfortunately, she didn't realize this in time to obtain the greatest of those worthwhile values - true and reciprocated love. However, she did get what she needed and was looking toward the future with her trademark confidence and assurance.Just a fabulous, fabulous book.",
            "I had borrowed the audio from my local library, and after both realizing I wouldn't finish it in time, and that it was so very good I wanted to share it, I bought it. The narration is superb, and adds much to the story. After moving to Atlanta from Wisconsin I am familiar with many of the locations mentioned in the story. I also have begun to understand some of the old family Atlantans' feelings about what happened to their society.",
            "I cried when I finished this book. I honestly did. No, it was not the heart-breaking ending that brought me to tears, but the fact that there was no more Gone with the Wind. The book brought me so much into its depths, made me so much a part of its words, that at the end I felt almost as if a friend died. I just wish that Margaret Mitchell were alive so that I could talk to her, understand the mind that created such a masterpiece. I will never read a better book.",
            "Okay, everyone has been saying that this book is insulting, that it's racist, etc.Yes, it is extremely racist. Slavery is one of the most horrible inventions of the world. When slavery became race-oriented, it got even worse.But everyone really needs to take GWTW in perspective. First of all, the African-American slavery was hugely propagandized by the North U.S. There were a lot less beatings and brandings than is commonly perceived. The real horror of slavery was the psychological effect. Imagine that you've been told all your life that you are worthless, and fit only to be a slave. Wouldn't you conduct yourself in that way? That was the true horror of slavery. The reason that there were few beatings and brandings was even more horrible. It was because slaves were considered to be valuable property, and the plantation owners would as soon whip their valuable horses to death as whip their valuable slaves. The Northerners really didn't need to exaggerate bloodhounds and whippings; these stories are enough to get the North into a patriotic fervor. So GWTW, although ridiculously romanticized when it comes to slavery, is not completely incorrect. But it does fail to take into account the psychological effects that I just mentioned. It also fails the characterize the black characters in the narrative.Despite all these faults, GWTW is not meant to cater to modern views or even what we would call \"just\" views. It is meant to depict the Southern attitude at the time of the Civil War and the Reconstruction. Obviously, since everyone is incredibly incensed about its attitude, it succeeds remarkably well.Second of all, the movie romaticizes the already romantic book. Mitchell did not portray the rich plantationers in GWTW, she portrayed the middle-class, uneducated pioneers, with the exception of the Wilkes family. They were not contemptuous towards Crackers and poor whites because they were only a step and some luck above them. Essentially they had started out in their position. Gerald O'Hara is harldy anyone's estimation of the typical rich, supercilious, high-class planter. There weren't any stereotypical planters in Georgia, anyway, not before or after the Civil War. It was more a homesteading state than a Kentucky.So, overall, GWTW did exactly what it set out to do. And yes, it really neglects the black psychological view and focuses mainly on Scarlett's and Rhett's, with a couple of other characters. But this is also in character of the time. If anyone really wants to read a clarifying book about GWTW, read Southern Daughter. It ought to help with the rather confused opinions being circulated about GWTW.",
            "This has to be the best book ever written. Scarlett, Rhett, Melanie, and Ashley were brought to life within those 1,024 pages. You felt there sorrows, joys, worries, and loves. I loved Rhett, he was such a character! Melanie is larger than life, and too good for Scarlett. As long as she had Ashley, she was unaffected by the war. Ashley was a gentleman in an era he did not belong in. He was simply an ornament not a laborer. Rhett was everything a character could be, (not to mention very dashing.) Scarlett is probably the only character that you love one chapter and hate the next. She had a very strong will to survive and a lot of selfishness. She was strong enough to survive the war, but she was not as strong as Melanie, (mentally.) My very favorite characters were the Tarleton twins, espically Brent. I do think Melanie was not very strong (physically) but she made up for it with her huge heart, you would have to have one to always stand up for Scarlett. My favorite part of the book is when Scarlett and Rhett are on their honeymoon. They were really, truly in love then. I would think Scarlett would love Rhett long before she did. He was so kind and loving to Bonnie. I think Rhett really did love her the whole time, and he really would not leave her. Why didn't Scarlett marry Stuart? The book would be very different, but Scarlett loved him. GREAT BOOK!",
            "Oh my god!!! i just fifnished GWTW like an hour ago and i still keep bursting into tears. is that normal? maybe for other people but not for me. You must read this book- my sister read it when she was 13 and was waiting untill i was 13 for me to read it- i cant even begin to tell you how wonderfull this book is but i will try. it is a historic romance and is set during the Civil War in mainly Atlanta. Scarlett is a southern belle who has everthing done for her. she is shelfish and spoiled but we love her! Its like everything she did to be lady like just made her less lady like. everything that she does that is so hurtful she has a great reason for doing but she cannot see what the long term effect is and she just drives everone away! she loves a man who loves her but cannot marry her so to hurt him she marries a man she dosent love and thats when you get tottaly absorbeb into the BEST BOOK EVER!!! if i start with how great Meli and rhett are ill cry again! For some reason i really dont like ashley! and then at the end when scarlett finally relizes how much she loves rhett and he...! im crying! just trust me read the book. margaret mittchel is the best! and you will love love love rhett! hes so dashing! its the best!xxxx\"a true windie\" penelope.",

            "Gone with the Wind is a classic I read during my teenage years yet I had to purchase it in physical form since when I read it I had burrowed it from a library.

It is a story that will never come out of the line of favorite books to read so one must read it at least one in our lifetime!",
            "Gone With The Wind is one of my favorite books as well as a favorite movie. Margaret Mitchell has relayed thestory as though she was actually there. How does she know so many small details? Are they real or imaginary?Well, fiddle dee dee! They do seem real. This will be the 4th time that I have read the book. Saw the movieat age 14 on my first date. Cried and cried. And when we broke up that boyfriend told me that frankly, hedidn't give a damn.",
            "As powerful today as when it came out more than 70 years ago. Criticisms that it glorifies the Confederacy are misguided. While still honoring those who survived incredible hardship and loss, Margaret Mitchell skewers the pretensions of those who blindly believed in \"The Cause.\" Her portrayal of how blacks were treated manages to convey her obvious belief that in many respects some slaves were better people than their masters. A great love story set in the midst of a war that is fought mostly offstage. Her prose is magnificent, creating characters and a world that are unique in American literature. An aside: Hollywood did a magnificent job making a classic movie from such a huge book."

            "THE NAMELESS is perhaps the closest thing to a perfect horror novel I've read.The way I see it, the horror novel is a tough medium to do good work in. Part of the problem is that the novel format tends to encourage excess: excessive, clumsy writing; excessive elaboration; and excessive explanation. This excess works against a horror story, because the more we know and understand the horror, the less fearsome it is--the dread of the unknown, that gaping abyss in our awareness within which all our worst, most irrational fears take root, is a fundamental component of terror. Unfortunately, works that engage the reader's &quot;dread of the unknown&quot; are few and far between in these days of generic horrors, when formula plots and plain, nuance-free writing sell well, and exaggerated shocks are the closest things to true scares most writers strive for.So thank goodness we have writers like Ramsey Campbell, and novels like THE NAMELESS.Almost two decades after I first read it, THE NAMELESS is still one of the most frightening, perfectly constructed horror novels I've ever read; a gripping tale full of mystery, human drama, and shadowy spine-chilling terror provoked by horrors known and unknown. For sheer scare power, THE NAMELESS ranks somewhere near Campbell's best works, novels such as INCARNATE and THE INFLUENCE, and many of his great short stories.The story is the stuff of nightmare, a parent's uncontrollable nightmare worse than anything a conventional thriller could offer, growing darker, more horrific and bizarre as it progresses. It seemed young widow Barbara Waugh suffered a mother's worst nightmare when she learned her 4-year-old only child, Angela, had been kidnapped. This trauma was compounded soon afterwards by the discovery of a little girl's savaged corpse, mutilated beyond any hopes of identification yet clad in Angela's clothes, which led Barbara and the authorities to believe Angela had been brutally murdered. (As you'd expect, Campbell imparts these tragic scenes with an exquisite, mature sensitivity, unsullied by the mawkishness and false sweetness of sentimentality.) Then, nine years later, just after Barbara had come to terms with her grief, she receives a mysterious phone call at her office: A voice like a young girl's repeatedly calls her &quot;Mummy&quot;. And it soon becomes clear that her nightmare is only just beginning.As it turns out, Angela is still alive, and she's in the hands of a ghastly cult: an arcane, nomadic group made up of people who've abandoned their names and their individual identities. Even worse, these nameless, faceless conspirators are in thralldom to some terrifying supernatural force, capable of manipulating physical objects, be they living, dead, or inanimate, like obscene puppets. As one character explains with chilling simplicity, &quot;The bad got into things and made them move.&quot;It's testimony of Campbell's finely-honed storyteller's instincts that he handles the supernatural aspect of THE NAMELESS in an allusive manner, keeping it a mystery that hovers darkly in the wings; never diminishing its persistent unspoken menace by spelling it out in obvious terms or by allowing it to dominate the story. This obscurely sinister supernatural threat, this unknown terror, lends the scariest scenes in the book their disturbing power.With his inimitable style, Campbell draws readers into the heads of his characters, and so we experience the terror along with them. This technique works to remarkable effect in THE NAMELESS--we follow the protagonists around the dark decaying interiors of empty houses abandoned by the cult, looking for clues as the surroundings stir with silent threat. At times the terror is almost claustrophobic; the dread of the unknown becomes palpable. And we're with Barbara every nerve-jangling step of the way, right up to the story's devastating conclusion.But the real triumph of THE NAMELESS is not just that it's a very scary book, a dark horror tale that makes THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT look like pleasant holiday footage. Rather, it is that in this book Campbell combines scary supernatural horror and a compelling tale of personal tragedy and obsession even more successfully than he did in his superb earlier novels THE DOLL WHO ATE HIS MOTHER and THE PARASITE. Readers and horror fans alike are encouraged to seek out and read THE NAMELESS prior to seeing its recent Spanish film adaptation, LOS SIN NOMBRE. By all accounts, the film bears only passing resemblance to the book, and lacks both its depth of character and its supernatural terrors.",
            "Effectively scary can only describe this supernatural tale of a woman's quest to find her supposedly murdered daughter which leads her into a cult activity that may or may not exist. Ramsey Campbell succeeds in topping himself with this one. Everything about THE NAMELESS is highly impressive: from its multi-dimensional protagonist to its perfect plot pace, to its many edge-of-your-seat atmospheric moments. His prose is as gripping as the dark presence looming over the heroine. The ability with which he uses his narrative is reason enough to pick this one up. One word, one sentence, says so much. THE NAMELESS should definitely be on top of everyone's reading pile.-----Martin Boucher",
            "I had high hopes for this novel. Ramsey Campbell, a master of psychological horror, seemed poised to add some uncharacteristically tangible frights and perhaps even it a bit of good old-fashioned gore to this particular work of fiction. The concept is far from original-cult activity at its most disturbing-but I anxiously awaited the results of the author's decision to really get his hands dirty this time. The book crawled along in places, but intermittent moments of foreboding kept my optimism intact as I continued my quest to reach what I felt would be the shocking conclusion. Sadly, all of this great buildup essentially came to naught in the form of a sudden, anticlimactic, depressingly disappointing ending. This novel proves that where there's smoke, there is not in fact always fire. I actually felt cheated by the seeming rush job of an ending here, and I can only look back with regret at the high hopes I associated with this book as I made my way through it. After the complete absence of tension or excitement at the end, one is left with a number of unanswered questions and a small set of characters who apparently served no purpose whatsoever in the narrative. It is as if the author suddenly decided at the last minute that he just didn't care anymore.Perhaps the term \"the nameless\" makes you think of unimaginable entities out of space and time with revoltingly indescribable features; it certainly brought a Lovecraftian connotation to my mind initially. In terms of this novel, though, the Nameless are a cult who forego all earthly experience (such as names) in service to their cause. It remains unclear, but there goal seems to consist of gaining power for themselves and presumably opening the door for something evil, I suppose, to manifest itself. All I really know is that they were obsessed with torturing their victims and offering them up as sacrifices to nefarious agents (or so we are told but never really shown). There is some type of nonhuman agent associated with them, but I never really learned what it was or why Campbell thought it needed to be included in the first place. This cult had kidnapped Barbara Waugh's beloved three-year-old daughter, leaving behind an unrecognizable dead body which was naturally determined to be that of a murdered young Angela. Nine years later, Barbara suddenly begins to receive mysterious phone calls from someone purporting to be her long-dead daughter. Desperate to find out the truth and to rescue her daughter if she is in fact still alive, the distraught mother embarks on a frantic search for the group's whereabouts, assisted by her boyfriend Ted and a young reporter looking for her big break. They pick up rather easily on the trail of the cult and seem to always be a few days behind it as it moves around. But just who is chasing whom here? The Nameless have designs on Barbara herself, and they know that her obsession with finding her lost daughter will lead her to them. Some but by no means all of my own questions about Angela's real story are answered in the end, but they are less than satisfying.Ramsey Campbell is certainly a talented author, but he seems to have misfired on this comparatively early effort. He never goes as far as the storyline would seemingly require him to go here, and this retreat from the abyss he has spent so much time constructing damages the novel's effectiveness and appeal a great deal.",
            "Ramsey Campbell is what you might call \"Horror's best kept secret\" ['cept, there was never any INTENTION to keep him secret!], or a \"horror writer's horror writer\" [if you check out the back covers of his books, you find the likes of Clive Barker, Stephen King, and Peter Straub all but falling over themselves, trying to out-do each other in praising him; a phenom. I've only ever encountered elsewhere with Wm. S. Burroughs, whose books feature the likes of Joan Didion & Anthony Burgess, praising HIM to the High Heavens], but: the fact remains, he simply makes most \"horror\" practitioners NOWADAYS [Eli Roth, are you reading this? CAN you read?] look like the pansy-ass, sadistic little Nazi wanna-bes they truly ARE -- closer to a Mengele-meets-Pavlov frapp&eacute; than capable of anything Hawthorne, Poe, or Bierce ever came up with.(Hmm ... I'm digressing a LOT in this review ... better \"wrap up\" before I lose my audience ...)This book:(1.) Is scary as all-git-out;(2.) Accurately limns the modern-day society we live in (like Stephen King, often credited from bringing the Horror genre from its ghettoization in the realm of \"the Catholic\" to the realm of \"the Protestant\"), and PROCEEDS from THERE, rather than trying to back-end or jury-rig a \"scary story\" that bleeds over into (all-but-inevitable) story-ruining implausibilities;(3.) Get the \"LURE\" of such cults (over-organized religions; the Cult of the Nazis; \"Satan\"-worshippers; etc.) so UNCANNILY right that there isn't a WHOLE lot of reassuring space left in the reader's psyche after you finish the book and return to \"daily life\" . . .REMEMBER, KIDS: \"It's only a SCARY STORY...\"",
            "As a big fan of Horror Literature and more specifically of Ramsey Campbell I couldn't skip this book. I had just read \"The Parasite\" and loved it so I had great expectations for \"The Nameless\".It's not a bad book, the story is catching and it is a page turner as you get more and more curious to find out more about the cult and about Angela. However, when you get to the end of the book you are left wanting more as the author does not offer enough details about the cult or about the powers that Angela is supposed to have or who was the girl that they shot so as to make Barbara believe it was her daughter and how and why Arthur keeps showing to Angela and Barbara.I thought Ted's character deserved a little bit more development too. I found myself curious to know more about his personality and his motives since he has such a relevant role in the story. Also, it appears to me that some things are mentioned in the book just for the sake of being there as they lead to nothing and in the end there was no purpose to them whatsoever.All in all I found this book to be just ok.",
            "First let me say that you should ignore the rubes who have bashed this book for a reason i simply can't fathom. It's obvious that they have no idea what makes a horror novel great.Okay let's discuss the story. It starts off with the abduction of a woman's child and than her apparent murder. Years later the mother of the girl recieve's a phone call from a girl saying that she's her murdered child. It all picks up pace after that.Later in the book we learn about a cult that's members have no names (hence the title). The girl says she is living with them or that they are keeping her prisoner and only her mother can help rescue her. The cult worship some force or being that reminds me of one of H.P. Lovecraft's Old One's or nameless terrors. I can't reveal much more about the story because i do not want to ruin it for those who have not read it yet.This book starts alittle slow and than like a cannon blast it explode's never leaving the reader time to catch his or her breath. The horrible deeds of the cult will shock and disturb you a great deal and if they don't your a sick person. This book is downright scary because of Campbell's ability to scare the living daylights out of us with his descriptions of the enviorments and the shadows and things half glimpsed before all goes dark. Pick this up and enjoy it as much as i did...i have to say though that the ending is very different and some may not like it but if you have read Campbell before you will be able to take it better than most.",
            "When I brought The Nameless I thought it waswritten by an author that I quite liked.Then doubt crept in and I feared theauthor was none other than RC who hadwritten The Doll who Ate His Mother.After I confirmed my fears that it wasindeed the same author I dithered onwhether to read the book but decidedto give RC another chance.It wasn't worth it! RC is very goodat describing things, so good infact that most of the Namelessdescribes the countryside, housesetc and maybe about a 1/5th ofthe book has dialogue oradvancement of the plot. As StephenKing put it in In Writing, descriptionis a tool that needs to be usedappropriately. RC seems to wantto describe everything not justthe important or significant thingsand in this book he doesn'tmove very much beyond doing exactlythat.So if you like endless descriptions,a plot that hardly goes anywhere(except maybe in circles) than thisis your book.But if you want a good horror novelDON'T buy this book and don'twaste your time reading it thinkingthat maybe in the next page- or thenext- or the next etc, that somethingmight happen and that you mightactually be rewarded forplodding your way through TheNumbing! I fell into that trapand by the end of the book Iwas in horror at the fact thatnot only had I bought the bookbut that I'd also forcedmy self to read it to it'suninspired and unoriginal ending.The Numbing!What makes good horror? Well I won't claim to knowthat as everybody likes a horror (or not) for hisor her own reasons, and we should respect otherpeople's right to have their own opinion with outlabelling them as 'country bumpkins'[dictionarydefinition of a rube].Having said that I *can* recommend Cold Printby Ramsey Campell, an excellent read perhapsbecause he can't ramble on endlessly in ashort story.However for a truely good horror I suggestGraham Masterton's Ritual- now there's abook that's bound to make you squirm!",

Although my family is rarely mentioned in this book, it provides a very detailed account of how life was back then in this STILL secluded part of Arizona. The author, Frank Gillette (born and raised there), does a wonderful job of bringing back to life the stories of the Cowboys, Families and occasional odd characters that helped settle that wild region. Written in a detailed and smoothly flowing prose, Gillette captures your attention and holds it, making it hard to put the book down. From shoot-outs, rescue missions, medical emergencies and a comprehensive view of the struggles of plain old day to day living, you will feel right there alongside these unassuming heroes of the frontier.

Alger's Snow Storm is a fast-paced, action-packed read that will keep you turning the pages and wishing you could read faster. Not only is Snow Storm extremely well written and the plot well-crafted, but the main character, Greg O'Brien has a quick tongue and a sense of humor that provides the reader with just enough comic relief to balance the thrill-a-minute action as events unfold in the story.

We both appreciated that the author didn't seem to take himself or this book too seriously; the leading man is not so heroic that he becomes larger than life. His ability to mess up and then poke fun at himself before rallying to victory make him very likeable and enjoyable to follow. And the author's knowledge of locale and experience as a weather man make his characters very believable - I felt the hero could have been the guy living next door.

            "This a Quality Paperback Book Club collection of three novels that stand well on their own.First is The Day of the Triffids, by John Wyndham, the story of an unbelievable menace - plants from outer space. This story works best in print, where you can imagine the scope of the problem after vast numbers of people go blind and the seemingly harmless plants start creeping around.Second is the horrific I Am Legend, by Richard Matheson, one of the most horrifying vampire stories ever written and according to the cover Stephen King called it 'an inspiration'. I believe it. There's something about the point of view of the last man alive in a world where everyone else has become a vampire - a man who understands all too well what has been happening because he has been doggedly figuring out the scientific details, but the social and emotional details are even more horrifying.The third and final novel in this collection is Time Out of Joint by Philip K. Dick. Well before The Truman Show we have the story of a fifties town that has been built and maintained to provide an environment for one man. Victor Nielson has one special talent that he can continue to use even though he has retreated to a delusional state from his life in the late 20th century, and the government is doing everything it can to help him to do it.One thing that has kept these stories strong is that they're not about specific gadgets, they're about thematic situations that we worry about even though the details change. What if something seemingly harmless comes along and starts destroying the world? What if everything changes and we're the only one left having to deal with and fight the change? What if we're busy doing something vitally important but we're not sure that it's the right thing to do?Recommended."

            "Jonathan Kozol, author of Ordinary Resurrections, was a teacher in the 1960's until, legend has it, he was fired for reading a Langston Hughes poem to his students in inner-city Boston. Since his forced departure from the classroom, Kozol has been a student of public education, focusing on the inequities of quality of education between the haves and the have-nots. His books include: Death at an Early Age; The Night is Dark and I am far From Home; Rachel and her Children; Savage Inequalities; and Amazing Graces.Kozol describes his current work:&quot;This is a book about a group of children whom I've come to know during their early years of life, not in the infant years but in the ones just after, when they start to go to school and poke around into the world and figure out what possibilities for hope and happiness it holds. Most of these children live within a section of the South Bronx called Mott Haven which, for much of the past decade, was the nation's epicenter for the plague of pediatric and maternal AIDS and remains one of the centers of an epidemic of adult and pediatric asthma that has swept across the inner-city populations of our nation in these years.&quot;At the end of the book's introduction, Kozol says: &quot;I'm grateful to the priest and congregation of St. Ann's (Church - of Morrisania - Episcopalian) for giving me the privilege to share the lives of children here...But most of all I'm grateful to the children, who have been so kind and generous to me, as they have been to many people who do nothing to deserve their loyalty and love, which aren't for sale and never can be earned, and who, with bashful voices, tiny fingers, sometimes unintended humor, and wise hearts, illuminate the lives of everyone who know them.&quot;Kozol followed the children of P.(ublic) S.(chool) 30 and the eighty children who participate St. Ann's after school program for two years. Their stories and the stories of their parents, teachers and caretakers are anything but ordinary. These children will crawl right into your heart and take up residence. It's been a long time since a book has chronicled so many real-life miracles performed on a daily basis by ordinary people who happen to posses extraordinary compassion, kindness and caring.I challenge anyone who reads Ordinary Resurrections to remain unmoved by Pineapple's brashness, Elio's false bravado, Ariel's insight, Mother Martha (St. Ann's priest) and her dog, or Katrice's adroitness in overseeing the church's kitchen. Some of the stories are uplifting; some will break your heart.Although the book drags a bit in the middle when Kozol attempts to explain educational philosophies in laymen's terms, he never leaves the children long enough to make the intellectual content too boring.If there is justice for Kozol and the children of Mott Haven, this should garner a lot of attention and win awards. Words like Pulitzer, Nobel, and National Book Award will fit nicely behind the title. Ordinary Resurrections should be required reading for all teachers and the rest of the human race, too. It's that good.Kudos to Kozol and his kids. They deserve every good thing in life!Terry Mathews, Reviewer",
            "I think it's very telling that Jonathan Kovol is friends withFred Rogers (one of my heroes) and talks about that in this book, ashis writing reminds me of how Mister Rogers talks---his extremely strong feelings of love and caring and understanding of the children he is friends with (for that is what he is, friends, not an observer) comes through in every sentence. It's inspiring to read about the lives these children are living---how they manage to have a happy childhood and remain innocent and caring in such a tough environment, but you know the road ahead for them is not going to be an easy one. If you don't feel outraged after reading this book about the state of the public schools in big cities, you haven't read too carefully. And the fault is not where so many like to put it--with the teachers, with the students, with the parents, the fault is with a society where people are getting richer and richer but there is still not enough money to have reasonable class sizes in cities, to restore music and arts and doctors in the schools taken away 20 years ago, and to have a graduation rate not as shameful as the one where most of these kids will go to high school. This book really moved me and I am going to work harder to improve my childrens' urban schools.",
            "This powerful work is at once inspiring, frustrating and captivating. Kozol draws the reader into a world called Mott Haven that is filled with substance, love, service and hope. He poignantly describes the lives of children while blasting the manner in which we have chosen to deal with our most needy sectors of society. Kozol's gifted and powerful storytelling reminds us of several truths:1. Segregation is potentially a bigger problem today than ever. White flight, private schools, school choice, home-schooling, virtual schools and lack of equitable access to technology are widening the gap.2. Inequities in education must be addressed with the underlying belief that every child has the potential to achieve his/her dreams. Society must be responsible and held accountable for creating conditions ensuring that this occurs.3. Teachers and students must all be able to work and learn in optimum conditions that safeguard and ensure dignity.4. Although children appear to be resilient, we must protect their innocence, ensure they have the chance to dream and be inspired by their eternal optimism and hope. The real heroes of today are those who spend time with our children, listening to and nurturing their dreams.5. We spend too much on our prison system and must figure out a way to divert that funding to education and healthcare so we can be proactive rather than reactive.Kozol manages to convey the realities of inner city education by illuminating the complexities behind the daily challenges facing teachers and parents. His manner of connecting the problems to the institutions and practices that society has created to deal with those who do not \"fit the system\" provides a wake-up call to all of us who are working to make a difference in the lives of children. Kozol shows us that the system we have created is nurturing itself instead of helping people to break out of the vicious cycle characterized by lack of quality education, health care, meaningful work opportunities and dignity. We can no longer ignore the problems in the inner cities of America, not just because it makes economic sense but because it makes human sense to individually develop our most precious resources - our children. Community leaders, parents, educators, and corporate leaders should put this compelling book on the top of their \"must read\" list.",
            "There are traps all to easy to fall into when writing a book recounting one's interactions with children. The children can be simplified into charicatures, they can be made more complex and no longer childlike, and they can be modified to fit the author's argument. Mr. Kozol draws upon 40 years of working with children to avoid these pitfalls in telling the inspiring and haunting stories of these wonderful children. Mr. Kozol writes with a beautiful simplicity that is both stirring and honest. This is a fabulous book.",
            "I, too, heard Mr. Kozol on NPR - and in the space of a few minutes was not only driven to tears, but driven to purchase the book. In a time when the world feels out of control and impossible for any one of us to alter its course, Jonathon Kozol gives me hope by reminding us that all children start out with pure love, truth and innocence - regardless of their economic or social circumstance. And that noticing and nurturing children is a precious and enriching process. The book is written in a compellingly intimate way, and I feel priveleged to have been introduced to the children of Mott Haven and to the grown ups who love and care for them.",
            "In Ordinary Resurrections, Jonathan Kozol deviates from his usual \"gloves off\" attack of the issues facing minority children. Instead of building the case against the inequitable system with facts and figures, as he has in previous work, he has chosen the subtle but effective approach of a storyteller. He paints a very descriptive portrait of the victims of continued segregation and racism that may inspire those in positions of influence to make more compassionate decisions regarding the lives of the children they serve.Things that scream out to me from Kozol's book(s):1) Incarceration vs. Education (do the math!)The incarceration industry is thriving on blind public support. If taxpayers knew they were paying on the average ten to twenty times more to incarcerate supposed perpetrators of victimless crimes than it would cost to educate them, I'd bet they might even overlook their racist fears. The corporate/federal mentality that chooses to decide early on what these children will bring to the economy seems to prefer them as a product in this system versus potential contributors to something greater.2) Resilience (despite our conditional \"help\")In their innocent naivet&eacute; the children neglected by the system remain courageous, hopeful, and resilient. This resilience may diminish as they weather the inequities of the system that oppresses them, but it is often the attribute that enables them to succeed regardless of our preaching and teaching. Just imagine what heights they might reach if they continued to be nurtured as they are by the caring individuals in their lives now.3) Compassion (essential)As a beneficiary of white male privilege his reflections from the other side of the gap are poignant and insightful lessons for those of us too far removed from the reality that exists in many of our cities. Even after this racial inequity is acknowledged it is difficult for most of us to express empathy in ways that ring genuine. Kozol does! He is trusted and welcomed by the culture and community he strives to serve. His stories reflect a model for learning and practicing compassion which, in my opinion, may be the single most important factor in saving ourselves from extinction. Kozol repeatedly demonstrates the importanceof compassion in his work. Listen to him!4) Racism, segregation, inequality (market view politics)Racism is institutionalized in the United States despite the hope segregation was ending that the civil rights movements of the sixties inspired. \"Kids notice that no politicians talk about this. They hear the politicians saying, \"We're gonna have tougher standards in your separate-but-not-equal schools. We're gonna raise the bar of academic discipline in your separate-but-not-equal schools.\" But nobody says we're going to make them less separate and more equal. Nobody says that.\" - Kozol interview in Education World5) Toxic environments (no one to litigate)AIDS, asthma, drugs, violence, toxic pollution, poverty, malnutrition, lack of medical attention, apartheid economics, and neglect are common elements in the environment Kozol's children try to survive in. Basic needs must be satisfied before we can expect children to be receptive to that which we would have them learn. Kozol is issuing a wake-up call to the complacent masses that are either unaware or in denial that this situation is serious and threatens all of us socially, emotionally, and economically.In my opinion, implications for educators that may be gleaned from Kozol's book include:* The extreme importance of compassion in all aspects of dealing with children.* Recognition that before we talk about diversity we need to spend a lot moretime in the conversation about racism.* Locking people up is not rehabilitation and in the long run is socially,emotionally, spiritually, and economically disastrous. Break the cycle of incarceration!",
            "Jonathan Kozal has taken away the protective myth that America's school children are all treated equally, with dignity and given unvarying opportunities. In his latest book, ORDINARY RESURRECTIONS, Kozal's readers get a glimpse into a reality that replaces equal value with present day segregation to children of the poor. Although many in power would like to ignore the disgrace of how our underprivileged students are educationally treated in areas such as Mott Haven, New York, Kozal's first hand account of such inequality calls for a recognition and reformation of America's priorities. Told in the children's words, this book contributes awareness to the desperate need for compassion to and knowledge of the struggles of many American youth. The facts are both shocking and compelling, and will challenge the values one holds to necessitate action on our children's behalf. As Kozal states, the reality is that \"...there are few areas in which the value we attribute to a child's life may be so clearly measured as in the decisions that we make about the money we believe it's worth investing in the education of one person's child as opposed to that of someone else's child.\" Once read, ORDINARY RESURRECTIONS destroys the bliss of ignorance. One is faced with the decision to powerfully act or despairingly ignore.",
            "kozol is my hero. i am a teacher in washington, dc. i see the same things kozol sees, i feel the same way he feels and i am continually frustrated by those who don't. it is impossible to listen to the news and read the papers and get a clear picture of the inequalities in urban education. these kids are every bit as dynamic as kids in the suburbs, and i might even argue that they are more dynamic because they are forced to rise above their problems again and again. i challenge others to forget what the politicians say, forget what the media says, become a teacher or a volunteer in the inner city and meet these special kids. don't let this book just be one that sits on your shelf. use it to motivate you to help make a difference.",
            "Having recently read Jonathan Kozol's &quot;Savage Inequalities&quot;, I am struck by Kozol's change of pace. Kozol is not a renegade, not a defender of children in this book, but a personal friend. I am struck with the lyricism and melody of the book. It is written from the heart, out of love and admiration for the forgotten children of the South Bronx.Kozol has no children of his own. A bachelor in his sixties, Kozol marvels at the innocence of the children from the South Bronx and is touched by their true friendship. The children want to get to know him better, want to know all about him and look forward to his visits. Kozol visits with them regularly, tutors them during long visits, and attends mass with them. He is deeply moved by the children's wanting to involve him in the Catholic rituals of mass, including taking communion. Kozol says the kids want him to &quot;try the bread and wine, its good.&quot; Kozol has a definite message. Despite poverty, violence, absence of parents, absence of security; all children are born into hopeful innocence which takes years to destroy.I was overcome with emotion during many passages in this book. It is a very personal book which bares the author's soul. I recommend this book for everyone. Kozol is a testament to the goodness in mankind. Goodness that often goes unrecognized. I give the book 5 stars, but I give Mr. Kozol an infinite number of stars, for his devotion, for his love, for his hope for the children of the South Bronx and their future.",
            "As the end of the book drew near, I knew that I did not want it to finish. Through Kozol's descriptive, real life language, I felt as if I knew the students and wanted to continue along life's journey with them. I became frustrated, because I want to know what happens to the individual children. Are they able to remain strong with the help of the people at St. Ann's? Or do they fall into a life filled with crimes and drugs? Although I am upset, it is good, almost like a passion that is a direct result of Jonathan Kozol. Within an instant, he invites his readers to come along with him into this world in the South Bronx, a world that many people have not entered and maybe never will. Therefore, I believe Ordinary Resurrections is extremely powerful, for it has the capability to extend its arms and touch many people; there truly is no limit to the people who Kozol may affect. This idea of having no boundaries is crucial in today's society, because people should take the time not only to acknowledge, but help those who are less fortunate. It's a frightening world, especially for our youth, which is why they need our guidance and assistance to make sense of it all and find their own path.",
            "Some might describe Jonathan Kozol's &quot;Ordinary Resurrections&quot; as a softer, more positive book than his past attacks on the inequalities of education. While the story-telling style often presents the &quot;warm, fuzzy&quot; experiences Kozol shared with young children in the South Bronx of New York, the primary message is still an alarming exposure of stark inequity in the availability of educational institutions, personnel, and resources for children in the public schools of New York City. The setting for these experiences is a neighborhood known as Mott Haven, one of the most impoverished areas of the city. The majority of Kozol's time is spent visiting with children, parents, teachers, and workers who are connected with an &quot;after school&quot; program housed at St. Ann's, an Episcopalian church in Mott Haven. Children attending St. Ann's after school program have a major advantage over others in the South Bronx; the dedicated volunteer workers who feed them, help them with homework, offer special programs, and often care for them as closely as their own family. Mother Martha, St. Ann's priest is an active participant in all of these activities, as well as spiritual instruction and guidance.Kozol shares bits and pieces of the children's' lives, which include stark realities such as a large percentage of absentee fathers, many who are in prison, an extremely high rate of asthma due largely to poor environmental conditions, a high incidence of AIDS in relatives, gangs, shootings, hunger, lack of health care, and eviction. The term &quot;apartheid education&quot; is used in describing how skin color and class origin still determine curricular provision for these children, limiting their educational resources and their future. Stories shared indicate that expectations are set lower than other areas of the city and children's dreams for the future are effectively stifled. They are encouraged to plan careers as hairdressers, nurse's aides, or technicians, rather than professionals requiring a college degree. Kozol urges us not to impose &quot;global preconceptions on a multitude of diverse personalities and motivations in a given group of' children&quot;.The stark reality is that the money spent on children's' education per capita is much less in South Bronx than other areas of the city, and even miniscule compared to the amount spent to incarcerate men in the nearest prison. When Kozol is challenged with the question of whether money really is the only answer to the problems faced by schools serving poorest children in our cities now, he responds, &quot;I think it is fair to answer, No. It is not the only answer, but it is often a precondition for most other answers.&quot;Despite the disheartening facts of life and lack of resources, there is a bright side to Kozol's reflections. He describes with wonder at times of &quot;the deep, inextinguishable goodness at the core of creation&quot; evidenced over and over again in the children of Mott Haven. While many term these children resilient, Kozol argues that word does an justice the true qualities that help them prevail, such as ingenuity, courage, love, and especially spiritual faith. &quot;Ordinary resurrection&quot; is a term used by an Episcopal priest named Robert Morris who speaks about the commonplace and frequently unnoticed ways that people rise above their loneliness and fear. He states, &quot;We all lie down. We all rise up. We do this every day. The Resurrection does not wait for Easter.&quot; This is the life of the children at Mott Haven. How they rise up every day is the heartwarming encouraging part of Kozol's book. Why they have to do it is the heart-disturbing part that makes the reader want to agree that something needs to be done to invest in these children's' futures, that they deserve a chance at something better. As Kozol asks, &quot;why not give these kids the best we have because we are a wealthy nation and they're children and deserve to have some fun while they're still less than four feet high?&quot;",
            "Having read many of Kozol's previous books, I have developed a great admiration for him and his lifelong dedication to social justice and poor children, and his eloquent arguments on their behalf. I've wondered at how he has managed to spend nearly 40 years of his life in this pursuit. This book shows us why--he truly enjoys and loves the children he advocates for. Like Savage Inequalities and Amazing Grace (both must reads) the children's words themselves move you with their honesty, their innocence, and their hope. I can still see Elio moving his arms to &quot;catch one of God's answers to his prayers&quot;. But this book also gives us some insight into Kozol himself--his struggles with the failing health of his parents especially. While his earlier books often were suffused with anger at the inequalities of the public education system and social framework, this book is filled with hope and joy. and a little bit of sadness too. And, surprisingly, it is just as effective.",
            "Thank you Jonhathan...finally we have a public voice. I grew up in the South Bronx, on the Gran Concourse, and your book brought back many, many troubling and heart wrenching memories.My family became one of the sad statistics you referred to in your book...drugs, violence and jail time..are/were a very much big part of my families life. By the grace of God I have escaped the Bronx to raise my own child in Calf. but I have a longing in my heart to go back to the Bronx to make a difference.It is my plan after college to open a home for the children of the South Bronx and to work with places such as St.Anns to offer hope for these beautiful children.To those in our society that have written us off as hopeless and useless..may God have mercy on you..to the city of NY..may God forgive you for the violations you have inflicted upon the poor of the city...If this book does not urge you to change your views, contribute and help those that are less fortunate then there is surely something wrong with your heart.Johnathn I applaud you for your efforts, your love and concern..may God bless you and to the children of the Bronx.. I will be home soon and we will make a way.",
            "The Bronx has a long history. I'm always bumping into middle-aged and elderly professionals from the Bronx. Their mothers scrubbed floors; they went to City University. They now live in million-dollar condos in Manhattan. The ghetto is a conveyor belt for those who make up their minds to sacrifice their youth for future gain. Today's Bronx looks very much as Kozol describes. The very young are cute and inspiring, I suppose, but there must be a reason he leaves out the teens and their older brothers and sisters. The modern ghetto doesn't put a premium on discipline and learning. Kozol feeds into the victimology, seeing the community suffering from the failures of others to \"do\" right by them. Teachers know, however, that much would be improved if parents would simply make their children go to bed on time. Crime would be halved if kids were told to come in by 9. Early immigrants left the Bronx for the affluent suburbs, having devoted themselves to their children's education. Today it is rare indeed to meet a parent who has even one book in the house. Funding won't make up for this basic poverty of values.",
            "Ordinary Resurrections is one of the most important books I've ever read and one of the most poignantly beautiful. It is an absolute must read for everyone who cares about children, the wide disparity in economic opportunity in the U.S., and who dares to hope for our future. Kozol movingly brings to life in his first-hand descriptive account the lives and conditions in their own words of children and their families who have been deliberately neglected, ignored, hidden away. This true story of their hope, strength, resilience, and beauty testifies to the dominance of the human spirit in the face of unspeakable abuse by government at every level and all systems that have failed them.",
            "kozol manages to do in this book, what he wasn't able to do in other books- simply love the children he was surrounded by. in this work, you can truly feel him love the children of mott haven, and in turn, feel them love him. you are given the awesome opportunity to appreciate unconditional love through his relationships with a host of characters from the community. he is so no longer the outsider he seemed to be in AMAZING GRACE. he has truly become a part of the community he once only studied.",
            "This is Kozol's most accessible and most hopeful book. It's a warm and moving portrait of children and adults in a very tough part of New York City, individuals we grow to care about as we journey with Kozol. Unlike his first book, 'Death at an Early Age, these children do not die. Kozol aknowledges and renounces his earlier pessimism and invites us to celebrate the human spirit.",
            "as a &quot;survior&quot; of the South Bronx I can only reassure the readers that Jonathans reflections of the segragation,poverety and dispair that thrives in the Bronx is sadly too true...but he is also correct in the innocence of the children of the Bronx and the one time in your life that no matte where you live or what you do...there is that special place.I never went to St. Ann's but I know plan too..after completing my degree I plan on opening a home for children in the south bronx to give them the chance, the opportunity that so many of us never had...To the &quot;elite&quot; of New York and the policy makers...may God forgive you for what you do to the children of the South Bronx..my deepest and most sincere respect go to Jonathan for such a well written book and his obvious care for these children.",
            "I just re-read ORDINARY RESURRECTIONS and wanted to update my review....the book is just wonderful....and full of such hope!Like other reviewers, I heard Mr. Kozol's interview on National Public Radio during my commute home and was completely enchanted by his stories of Pineapple and her friends in Mott Haven.I ordered the book from amamzon.com and devoured it in two sittings.I cannot remember when a book moved me as much as this one. I'm not sure what gifts God gave Jonathan Kozol, but one of them is true compassion and insight without judgment or pretense.I was continually amazed, as was Kozol, at these children's tenderness, kindness, their incredible gift of insight and their wide-eyed innocence.At the back of the book, there is an address for St. Ann's Church. I will be sending them a check...for St. Ann's Scholars...for Pineapple and Elio and Mother Martha and all the children and caretakers who perform miracles day in and day out.This should be required reading for not only present/future teachers, it should be required reading for the human race.I hope Kozol and his kids win the Pulitzer/Nobel/and any other available award!Read this book...you will be richer for it.",
            "Jonathan Kozol, more than 30 years after writing his first book, Death at an Early Age: the Destruction of the Hearts and Minds of Negro Children in Boston Public Schools, releases Ordinary Resurrections: Children in the Years of Hope. The subtitle, \"Children in the Years of Hope\", a pretty strong assertion considering what little real hope (a wish or desire accompanied by confident expectation of its fulfillment) he claims there is in the South Bronx area he is writing about now. He constructs a pretty bleak picture of the children the subtitle represents. Perhaps it should have been named, Ordinary Resurrections: Children in the Years of Hope against Hope. Most of the children of Mott Haven have faith (belief that does not rest on logical proof or material evidence), not hope. There is little reason or justification for even the prospect of hope with Kozol's repeated mention of unrelenting drawbacks, disappointing economic constructs and substantial statistics that overshadow the hope he attempts to convey.",
            "I got through 1/2 of this book and I couldn't get any further. I like the stories of the children. But it didn't keep me interested. I felt a lot of the information about the neighborhoods, school district issues, and the \"political\" issues were repetitive. The relationships between the author and the children and people of the neighborhood were fine and all, but it wasn't enough to keep me reading. It was rather dull and slow.",

            "Chris Bohjalian's, \"The Buffalo Soldier\", is a well-crafted and at times beautifully written novel. Simplified, the book is about human nature when placed under extreme duress due to tragedy. No parent should ever have to bury one child much less face the horror of two young deaths, and any attempt at recovery is by definition going to be traumatic at best. The author creates a couple that tries to travel back to some form of life that is tolerable if not one that will ever be purely happy again. The way they proceed is extreme in the unusual choices they make, and the ingrained difficulties their choice is burdened with.The setting is Vermont, a very rural Vermont of dirt roads and mountain streams that can still tear apart lives. This is not Burlington by the lake, a city an hours drive from cosmopolitan Montreal. The decision to take a Foster Child in to their home is hardly an easy choice. Many children from these programs have lead itinerant lives at best, and have experienced views of human behavior that no person should see. So when a grieving couple opens their home to a young African American boy who has been bounced about by the system from his original home in Philadelphia, only to be placed in a very rural and very white environment, there are issues for everyone.The author deals with so many issues that it is not possible to comment on them all, so I choose one that I enjoyed the most. This young boy has the good fortune to have an elderly couple that helps him to learn about his history and define himself, who offer some stability while his foster parents deal with their own demons that are far from confronted much less solved.This couple has traveled the nation and has brought home every knick-knack they have seen. These are the people that the makers of cheesy souvenirs live for. But more importantly they know this country's history and with a book and a cap with a buffalo on it they change this young man's life. Buffalo soldier was the name given to African American soldiers by Native Americans. It is a name that was given out of respect for these men, men that history too often slights.The young man learns of the history that caused these men to be honored, and they become for him the role models that he will emulate. This part of the novel was my favorite element; there were many others but none that struck with such power and grace. And that is why my comments for the title of this review are a bit ambivalent. There was much about the book I found to be slow, and some was a bit clich&eacute;. However this relationship made the entire book a worthwhile read.",
            "On many levels I enjoyed Bohjalian's The Buffalo Soldier so, why only the 3 stars? I'll begin with what I liked. The historic introduction at the beginning of each chapter. Although, I have a cursory knowledge of Buffalo Soldiers it has made me want to learn more. The development and insight into Alfred's character. Using Alfred as a catalyst to bring about changes in Laura's character, opening her up as it were, was poignant. The secondary characters of the Heberts brought some lightness into a rather dark novel.But, and now here it comes,I find it difficult to believe that every child in the town would be so callously prejudice. Especially when Alfred is described as handsome, intelligent and athletic. Or that the class teacher is so indifferent to the &quot;new&quot; kid, rather a brutal commentary on the education system in Vermont.My biggest problems however, were the relationship between Terry and Phoebe,his character, and the ending of the book. First the relationship,this struck me as an everyman's fantasy. A girlfriend/lover that wants nothing from the relationship. Phoebe was just too good to be true, no demands, no expectations and no recriminations. I suppose I am to feel sympathy for Terry because of the death of his daughters. Does this also mean I am to condone infidelity to his wife and indifference to a foster child? If Alfred hadn't saved his life would the distrust/indifference have remained? A rather stringent lesson to prove one's self worth. I found Terry weak, self centered, manipulative and a hypocrite. Never once did Terry or Phoebe consider that eventually the unborn child might want to locate his father and what results that might have on Laura's and Terry's relationship. Infact, the ending was just too pat. Phoebe quietly leaves with no ill will towards Terry, Laura forgives Terry....but wait how can that be as she has no knowledge of the unborn child? Does this suggest a sequel where she will be just as understanding when the &quot;child&quot; comes a knocking on her door 20 years later? How can a relationship exist between Laura and Terry with this rather onimous cloud hanging on the horizon. No, there are too many problems with Terry's character and the author's lack of accountability with it for this to be a satisfying book.",
            "\"The Buffalo Soldier\" proved to me that Chris Bohjalian is a wonderful, timeless storyteller. In this book, the author takes what could be harsh storylines of a loss of one's children, marital infidelity, and interracial adoptions and weaves a story that is a delight to read, with only subtle hints of these harsh issues--they become secondary to the real story of people's lives. He has a wonderful sense of the people in his home state of Vermont, and develops their characters so that you feel like you've known them all of your life. This was a wonderful read! I thorougly enjoyed one of his other books, \"Midwives,\" and now can't wait to read his other works!",
            "Chris Bohjalian proved in his wonderful novel, \"Midwives,\" that he has a deep understanding of the courage that ordinary people need to survive in a complex and often tragic world. He also showed an uncanny ability to write from both a male and a female perspective. In his latest novel, \"The Buffalo Soldier,\" Bohjalian once again beautifully explores how human relationships are tested by the pressures of life.The setting is rural Vermont. Bohjalian focuses on a troubled couple, Laura and Terry Sheldon, whose nine-year-old twin daughters die tragically in a flash flood. The Sheldons are grief-stricken and their sorrow spills over into their marriage, threatening to tear it apart. Laura and Terry decide to take in a ten-year-old foster child named Alfred, who is African-American. Alfred is a gentle boy, but he is hesitant to bond with anyone, since he has been moved around regularly from one home to another over the years.Bohjalian brilliantly describes the ever-changing dynamics in Laura's and Terry's relationship. The introduction of a child into their empty household may be an opportunity for the couple to heal, but Laura seems to relate to the boy while Terry holds back. Fortunately, Alfred is befriended by a wonderful and warm neighbor, Paul Hebert. Paul introduces Alfred to the history of the famed Buffalo soldiers, an African-American regiment that fought in the late 1800's. He also teaches Alfred how to care for and ride a horse. It is heart-warming to watch this reserved child blossom as he begins to form new friendships and as he learns more about himself and his heritage.Bohjalian switches perspective from one chapter to the next, and he allows us to attain an intimate knowledge of what each character thinks and feels. By the end of the novel, I was deeply invested in the outcome. Occasionally, the dialogue is a bit stilted and there are a few scenes that border on the melodramatic. Overall, however, \"The Buffalo Soldier\" is a touching reminder that although human beings are fragile, they are also resilient. Loving someone deeply makes us vulnerable to loss, but if we are to achieve a meaningful life, it is a risk worth taking.",
            "Chris Bohjalian has captured the essence of his characters, once again. In THE BUFFALO SOLDIER, a story about grief, marital strife, friendship and neighbors, and the sad past of a little boy trying to survive in the foster care system, Bohjalian manages to pull the reader into the stream of the story easily.The death of their twin girls has naturally changed Laura and Terry and even two years later we watch as they both continue to deal with their grief, albeit in very different ways. Terry, the cop, and Laura, the animal shelter supervisor, are going to react differently to this tragedy and it's interesting how their job choices reflect their reactions. Bohjalian does this in a very realistic way. Terry wants to be able to control his life, take charge, make things right. This is a very accurate portrayal for a dedicated law enforcement officer. Laura brings another child in their life, Alfred, an African American boy. Not only is this a challenge because his years in foster care have left him distrustful of most everyone, but they are living in Vermont where there are very few other African Americans.Just as it is Laura's nature to want to help others, protect and love those who don't have someone to care for them, it is Terry's nature to want life to feel more normal, even though he knows it never can.I was a little disturbed with the ending. It ends well but there were a few questions left unanswered for me. Perhaps Bohjalian is thinking of a sequel in the years to come. Or maybe we can fill in the blanks ourselves.At any rate, this is another good story by Chris Bohjalian as he continues to make interesting stories from unusual circumstances come alive.",
            "I have never read one of Bohjalian's books before even though I had purchased Midwives a few months back (it is still sitting on my shelf), but I guarantee this will not be the last one of his books I read. I have since ordered his last two books and look forward to reading those. This book follows the story of a couple who's twin daughters are killed during a flood, the foster son they take into their home two years later, the elderly couple who live across the street and the single, pregnant girlfriend who lives miles away and has never met any of the other characters except for the twins' father. Each chapter is told from the point of view of one of the characters and the story moves forward very rapidly. Although the book is close to 400 pages, the story is not dragged out and I never found myself skimming the pages or flipping forward just to get on with the story (as I have in some other books I've recently read). Every page has a point and each point flows to the next and I never found myself bored or anxious to get on with it - quite the opposite actually. I was sorry when I finished each chapter, wanting to hear more from that particular character only to go on to the next chapter and get just as interested in that character's point of view. I found myself routing for the foster child and mother, laughing at the elderly couple and frustrated and disappointed in the father's younger brother and even some of the father's actions. Descriptions are good and I could easily imagine the towns where the story took place. The story includes a few historical points also about the Buffalo SOldiers since the elder gentleman gives the foster child a book on the subject to read. Each chapter is introduced with a piece of history referring to those times and the Buffalo Soldiers and the reader will learn a little bit more about that time in history. I enjoyed this book and am looking forward to reading other books by Chris Bohjalian and his next release (whenever that may be - it sems life he spaces them about 18 months apart). If you like Alice Hoffman, you will most likely become a fan of Bohjalian since their styles are similar (characters linked together by a specific incident and stories that flow forward without hestiation). I know that I've become a fan and am happy I chose to read this book.",
            "I've been an avid fan of Chris Bohjalian since Midwives, he's such a gifted storyteller! But The Buffalo Soldier is his best yet! This book is a MUST for reading groups -- so much to discuss -- don't know what Oprah is waiting for! I was hooked from page one, I could not put it down. Wonderful character development and a rich, unique storyline. I enjoyed the story within a story (pay attention to the short paragraphs at the start of each chapter!). I'm in the book business, and when all your coworkers are talking about a book, you know it's something special.",
            "I like Bohjolain's books. They always teach you something. With Midwives, it was about midwifery. With The Law of Similars, we learn about homeopathy. With the Bufallo Soldiers, we learn about the foster care system, about being a cop, about grief after losing a child, and what it's like to be a minority (an African-American boy) in a small town.Bohjolain's takes the reader along with his well crafted characters and then, doesn't have them do what you think they would or should do. I like that. I can't always predict what his characters are going to do, or predict thier decisions. For example, I expected Terry to claim the child he left in Phoebe, but no, he made a completely unexpected decision.Bohjolain always leaves an interesting rise at the end of his books. You know you're getting to the end, and where other writers are tying up lose ends, Bohjolain gives us something to get excited about.And this book, The Buffalo Soldier? what gives with no quotation marks to mark off dialogue? I thought it gave the book a good clean look, but when I read the dialogue out loud, I found myself using a male voice when I should have been using a female voice. Not using quotation marks made the pages cleaner, and I bet it was a lot easier to write, not having to concern one's self with punctuation, but it did get a little, just a little, confusing at times.Good work though. Give us another story. I'm looking forward to the next one.",
            "I was disappointed in this book, perhaps because I expected so much more. It had been praised by a few people whose literary judgment I trust, and it just didn't measure up.The premise was good and interesting, but the characters were lifeless and pat. The boy, whom I liked and was interested in, really wasn't a bit authentic. He was just too good to be true in every way, to the point where I questioned that he had been shuffled around so much in the foster system; nobody would give up this child.I also couldn't stand the chauvenism in Terry, who impregnated a woman and then acted all along as though he didn't need to bear any responsibility toward the unborn child, as though the only problem was figuring out which woman/life HE wanted. I kept reminding myself that this sort of machismo is in fact realistic, but given Terry's self-righteous, straight-laced, State Trooper image, it really wasn't consistent with his character. Also, as has been mentioned elsewhere here, his mistress was ridiculously generous, thoughtful and wise for someone who was in her predicament to begin with.The ending was unrealistic too, but I didn't mind, considering the lack of compelling drama throughout the rest of the book. I had heard or read that it had a good ending (meaning exciting), so that kept me reading. The writing itself is overrated I think. It's very plain, like a reporter's--certainly not the kind of writing that appeals to other writers.Finally, and inexplicably, I paid no attention whatsoever to the italicized bits at the beginning of each chapter--the stuff about the Buffalo Soldiers. At first I did, but they offered nothing in the way of understanding the novel at hand, and I found them boring. He could have made that whole connection a bit more resonant. I'm the type who rushes to the computer to find out more about the historical surroundings of novels when I finish--like reading about Opus Dei and DaVinci after THE DAVINCI CODE and about King Henry IIIX after THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL--but this one left me cold. I still haven't researched the Buffalo Soldiers, and that says something about the author's success in bringing the subject home.",
            "Strangely enough, after finishing this book, I realized that what kept me reading was more my interest in the outcome of Alfred's life (the foster child) and his relationship with Paul & Emily Hebert (his neighbors), than in the main characters themselves, Laura & Terry Sheldon.I found them to be very superficial and cold. The author seems to only scratch the surface, of these foster parents, emotions and feelings. Something is missing, Laura is bland & colourless and her husband Terry is self centered & arrogant. I could not feel, (even in the end, them seemed fake) compassion and/or empathy towards this duo, no matter how hard I tried.All the depth and emotion of this story revolves around the genuine loving attachment that slowly progresses between the Heberts & Alfred and also their mutual affection for each other & a horse named Mesa.I enjoyed that each chapter began with a little more insight into the history of the United States Calvary. I applaud Chris Bohjalian for introducing the reader to the story of the Buffalo soldiers in such an innovative style.( It merited the third *)After reading ''Midwives'' by the same author, which surpasses by far ''The Buffalo Soldier'', I must admit being somewhat deceived.",
            "I have read all of Chris Bohjalian's books and this one in one of the best. Such a wonderful, compelling story. Definitely worth buying.",
            "Well written and believable. This is a touching and thought provoking story of a young foster chld who finds love, pride in himself and direction for his life in a small hamlet in Vermont. It touches on the topic of bigotry in this child's new life and how he learns the meaning of family.",
            "I found this book very compelling and could hardly put it down.It is definitely the best novel Bohjalian has written to date.",
            "Disappointing on many levels. Why this was written without quotation marks, I don't know, but it was a struggle reading this novel. In some places, it helped that each speaker was a separate paragraph, but other times the dialogue, without quotation marks, was embedded in the narrative. Not a good style.Pronoun confusion. Often there was a paragraph when two or more men or women were mentioned, yet the author used simply he or she and it wasn't clear which he or she the author meant.There was an annoying overuse of \"brief moment,\" \"brief second,\" even one \"very brief moment.\" A moment/second is brief to begin with. Sometimes there was \"a long moment,\" as opposed to a brief moment.When it was the boy's point of view, the ten-year-old often had observations that were beyond his age. I doubt that he would think the word \"effeminate,\" and certainly not this observation of his foster mother: \"There had been a balneal gauze across her eyes and her voice had been wan.\" Sheesh, I had to look up balneal. Something to do with bathing. ? Another time he recalls \"a septugenarian couple.\" And, \"He saw that her skin had the translucense of block ice.\" At ten?The ending was not impossible, but highly improbable.",
            "I have read many of Chris Bohjalian's books, and I really enjoy his descriptive writing not only of the characters but the settings as well. I enjoyed reading this book very much, and liked how he switched the perspective from one character to the next, as he has done in other books he has written. I particularly love the development of Alfred as his relationship with his foster mother and his neighbor's horse grows.The overall feeling from the book is a sad one. Like another poster, I too wanted the ending to be what it was, but it truly felt contrived and a whole lot of hulabaloo was wrapped up and packaged nicely within just a few pages for the ending.",
            "Two years after Laura and Terry's drowns in a bad flood, they decide to become foster parents to a 10 year old african american boy, Alfred. Laura comes to consider Alfred, as her own faster than Terry. I throught the book was good, it shows us that love can make anything happen.",
            "I've read most of Bohjalian's books and enjoyed them all, to one degree or another. This book, however, while compelling and well written, could use some editing since it bogs down at times. The ending disappointed with two major convenient twists which were inconsistent with Bohjalian's more realistic and centered tone. It's worth a read but it didn't deliver the punch of The Law of Similars or Midwives and was nowhere near as much fun as Water Witches. Better, however, than Transister Radio which didn't do much for me.",
            "Hope and Pain collide in this amazing story about a Vermont couple who become foster parents to a kicked-around, African-American boy. The prose is vivid and intense, Outstanding imagery and spectacular use of one bit of U.S. history that change many lives. Complex and simple at the same time. You'll be up all night with this one!",
            "Firstly I'd like to commend the reader of this eight audio cassette version, Ms. Alison Fraser, for having done as superb a narration I've yet heard on an audio version of any book. Secondly, the story itself has little to do with \"The Buffalo Soldiers\" story itself, yet the author, even by mentioning them very little in comparison with the rest of the story, manages to incorporate the essence of \"The Buffalo Soldiers\" themselves so that without it, I don't think this book could make it. Beginning with the tragic deaths of two little girls and the effect their deaths has on their family, Laura, their mother and Terry, their father, and intricately weaving in the story of a young, black, foster child, this story manages to capture and tug at your heart quite strongly. Terry is a \"tough guy\" state trooper you have to be careful not to dislike, but by tape 2 I was transfixed, listening more and more each day, needing outcomes. The author's message seems clear, triumph over tragedy, victory despite adversity, harsh realities we ignore when we could help, yet this tender story of Alfred, a ten year old black child, says so much more. Chris Bohjalian speaks to prejudice, to nightmares, to heartaches, to love and to spirit in the harsh settings of today and during the Buffalo Soldier's time as well. The story is brilliantly crafted and excellently told. This one, well, you might, perhaps, come to believe in your dreams again.",
            "I was intrigued by the basic premise of this book, about a couple who tragically lose their twin daughters in a flood, then several years later decide to become foster parents. They take in a 10-year-old African American boy named Alfred. This heartwarming story reveals how this little boy affects the lives of everyone he meets. One of the highlights of the story is how an endearing friendship develops between Alfred and an elderly, retired neighbor. It shows how anyone, no matter what age, can bring hope and encouragement into another person's life.",
            "Heartbreaking story about the death of the twins....every parents' nightmare.I enjoyed the book despite this fact...adopting a child helped ease the pain....too bad the husband had an affair.I also loved the next door neighbors...it was a good book...one that makes you think about life and its pains and joys. (",
            "I liked the first Bohjalian book I read - Midwives - very much. It took a difficult topic and presented it with a narrative and a variety of voices. The Buffalo Soldier is similar. As I was reading this book, I kept wondering why I hadn't read more of Bohjalian after I finished Midwives. The story moves along slowly, exploring the story from several viewpoints. Each chapter is written from a different point of view, and normally that is something that I hate. Normally, I have trouble remembering which character is in the lead at the moment. But in this book, Bohjalian brings out the character in more than what is in their head or the events they lead. The chapters have a different feel based on which character is in the lead. But the entire book feels like flowing down a stream - moving along toward the final moments - but not urgently, just drifting.I'll be picking up more of Bohjalian either at the library or the bookstore.",
            "As the adoptive parent of two children who were wards of the state social service, I found this book honest and reflective of many of the emotional, social, and cultural struggles we've gone through. Sometimes dealing with these kids it's as if we're from different planets. Many times I wonder if it's worth it. Alfred and Terry's relationship shows that stress. It's not a Cinderella ending but it is a growing through.I loved the empathetic and sagacious neighbors who provided much needed support.Some of the plot was sensational rather than realistic, but overall a very good read.",
            "I am an African-American whose wife is a native of Vermont. Having visited the State many times, I've become quite fond of its mountains, its small, clean towns and its people. I, therefore, was particularly interested in how the author would handle the story of an orphaned African-American boy in 90%+ white Vermont in his book, \"The Buffalo Soldier.\"The book is one I'm sure to re-read many times. The characters, as appropriate to the story line, are especially well developed -- and, as such, the type one can really \"feel\" for and care about, even Russell, the wayward brother of the main male character.Having read a great deal of history and fiction about the \"real\" Buffalo Soldiers, I thought the inserts of correspondence to and / or about Sergeant George Rowe, a Buffalo Soldier, added an extra dimension to the story. It reinforces ones emotional ties to the orphan boy, Alfred, and bespeaks volumes, historically speaking, about the somewhat orphaned status of the Buffalo Soldiers on the Western Plains.The author ended his story in such an upbeat, optimistic manner on Alfred -- \"...the immense thrust [of the horse] invisible to anyone but the boy on the creature's back -- he was rising, rising rising ... And Aloft\" -- that I feel he must write a sequel describing the teenage years and young manhood of Alfred. Hopefully we'll all be so fortunate!In short, I thoroughly enjoyed the book...",
            "NEGATIVES1. no quotation marks for dialogue; forced me to reread things, which irritates me2. melodramatic, yet I was caught up in the weather happenings3. the author's favorite word is \"moreover\"4. abrupt ending, and wrapped up too neatlyPOSITIVES1. a change from my usual reading2. from Alfred's perspective, I learned something about prejudice3. I enjoyed the relationships between Alfred/Mesa and Alfred/PaulSIDE NOTEI was expecting pedophilia after Russell's grabbing of Alfred, followed by Terry's outraged reaction. That could've added to the melodrama and given it even more of a Danielle Steel flair.So, as you can surmise, I'm not glad I read it. If I weren't reading it for my book club, I wouldn't have finished it. (Sometimes I DON'T finish them, but this book wasn't horrible, and I was eager to finish it after I got to the part about flooding and icy roads, which was near the end. However, I felt dissatisfied when I finished it.)",
            "It always amazes me that this very wonderful storyteller can create such a literary novel, while at the same time making it easy enough to read so that you'd become totally engrossed in it and want to take it on vacation with you. I have read two books by Bohjalian before: MIDWIVES and TRANS-SISTER RADIO and I LOVED them. The only reason I gave this book four stars was because I felt that it was lacking some of the pizzaz of the afore-mentioned novels. Mr. Bohjalian certainly has a knack for telling a story not about the events that happen in people's lives but about the actual people and what they are thinking and feeling and what thier perceptions are.Two years after thier twin daughters die tragically in a flood, Laura and Terry Sheldon become Foster parents for a ten-year-old, African-American boy named Alfred. Alfred has been shuffled around from foster home to foster home for years;he has some very real pain of his own and is struggling to fit in in a racist town in Vermont. Meanwhile, Terry and Laura are still trying to claw their way back from the dark depths of thier grief and face a very real threat to thier marriage:infedelity. Alfred struggles to know where he fits in and very cautiously befriends Paul and Emily Hebert, the Sheldon's elderly neighboors who help keep a watchful eye on what's going on.This book gives its reader a good, healthy dose of morality as well as good old-fashioned hope and love and the posibility of redemption.",
            "Chris A. Bojalian has scored again! Sentimentality mixed with a reason to give poignancy a chance to shine is apropos for melodrama at its best. The Buffalo Soldier, an unforgettable tale that catches the human element and give reason not to give up on this book. Tragedy finds Laura and Terry Sheldon, losing twin nine year-old daughters due to a flash flood in rural Vermont. The death of the girls only added more angst and ill-will to the couple struggling to keep their marriage afloat. This seemed a hard task to rectify as both dealt and reacted to the tragedy in different ways. To wit: Terry wants to be able to control his life, take charge, make things right. This is a very accurate portrayal for a dedicated law enforcement officer. Laura brings another child in their life, Alfred, an African American boy. Not only is this a challenge because his years in foster care have left him distrustful of most everyone, but they are living in Vermont where there are very few other African Americans. With this analogy in tow, the author is on his way, and does a masterful job of weaving a second element into the storyline, thus evoking a different point of view.Alfred, elicits emotional ties to The Buffalo Soldiers and can easily be synonymous with his status as an orphan. Historically speaking, the Buffalo Soldiers were a compelling factor in the taming of the west, and were ostracized by society and the military. The real gem in this story is the fact that when the need to be accepted without preconceived notions, it does wonders for the psyche and deals prejudice another blow for legitimacy. This, he gets from a concerned neighbor who does his part to add substance to this novel. Adding to that, Alfred solves his problems dealing with foster parentage by learning of the history that caused these men to be honored, as they came for him to be the role models that he emulated. Talking about turning a bad story to a good one, it worked for Alfred...but what about Laura and Terry? Does the aforementioned `good Samaritan' neighbor earn the appreciation of both Laura and Terry? How does Alfred's maturation affect his decision-making ideals and the timeliness of dealing with the world? These are questions that will be answered as one delves into this wrenching story.The author, from the characterizations offered here gives us a moving and a richly crafted drama that explores such issues as infidelity, bonding agents needed to keep children and families together, and the relative factors that causes a community to become one. The Buffalo Soldier is an awe-inspiring tale, profound and with an ethical aura to it that readers would appreciate. This you would expect from an author that is no stranger to dramatic cause and effect",
            "Chris Bohjalian is such a great author! I started with Midwives & am working my way through his books. The Buffalo Soldier is a great story. All of his stories keep you so interested. The characters are people you can relate to. Pick this book up!",
            "Normally I enjoy slow, deep character development, but these characters just did not seem all that interesting. The plot was PAINFULLY drawn out, like watching grass grow, and then all of a sudden it turns into an action movie ending. Very strange. First of his books I have read, and it doesn't make me interested in trying any of his others.",
            "The best thing about THE BUFFALO SOLDIER is the authentic Vermont atmosphere. From the backstreets of Saint Johnsbury to the \"multi-purpose room\" of an elementary school to the deer camps of the Northeast Kingdom, everything rings true and real as a brand new snowmobile in a snowless front yard on Christmas morning. ((My amazon.com address may be Georgia, but I used to live in White River Jct.))The plot is Greek tragedy: a Vermont State Trooper and his wife have twin daughters killed in a flash flood. They become foster parents and take in an alienated 10-year-old Black boy, who is tutored about the Buffalo Soldiers (the Negro cavalry of the old West) by the college professor across the street). The trooper has a one-night-stand with a young woman and impregnates her.Where to begin? There is no dialogue. The author writes very well, so this must not be to cover a weakness, but rather just an obnoxious literary technique. The point-of-view changes with every chapter, from trooper to wife to boy to professor to pregnant girl. I'll grant the professor and trooper are portrayed well, but I didn't find the wife and pregnant girl convincing, and the boy seemed more like a collection of symptoms from a sociology textbook on foster children than a real flesh-and-blood human being.Many reviewers have commented on the lame ended of the novel, but if you accept it as Greek tragedy, it works on that level. The twin daughters are taken away, replaced with a son, a woman is provided to impregnate, the wise of professor gives counsel, the environment is hostile, there are threads of family strife over generations, so you really shouldn't be surprised by a deus ex machina solution and an improbable ending.The author keeps wanting to say something important about fatherhood. The importance of the father-child relationship impacts of every character in this novel, but the lessons never aeem to be drawn. It almost begs for deoconstruction -- is the author showing us a brave new world where fatherhood is obsolete, or is he being ironic, showing what calamity awaits?",
            "I'm a big fan of Chris Bohjalian and was thoroughly disappointed in his last literary offering, \"Buffalo Soldier\". The characters were pretty flat and I really was wondering why I should care about their plights. I am used to the fast paced story of \"Midwives\" or \"Law of Similars\" where a lot occurs and you are actually grabbed by what's happening to the characters.I hope his next book is more interesting. Bummer.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed the relationships between the characters that Bohjalian brings to life in this book. Alfred, hoarding food in case he gets moved again, the elderly couple that loves and accepts him freely, the sadness of a mother who grieves for her lost daughters yet gains strength as she comes to love her foster child, and the hardened trooper who has a hard time trusting and loving a child who is not his own.However, I was upset at loose ends and easy exits at the end, such as the quickie elimination of Phoebe and the problem she represented. I would have liked to know more about Alfred's integration within the community and whether Terry's relationship with his family could be redeemed.All in all, it was a good read and Bohjalian must be commended for writing with great care for detail, pace and complexity.",
            "Chris Bohajalian is an amazing author captoring emotions of characters, male or female, adult or child, any culture, any time frame and thrilling the reader with an entrance into a world that is at once intense and charming. The main characters of this story are three dimensional, and the central character not only heals but brings healing and love to a multigenerational cast of characters.",
            "I LOVED this book. The story line and character development where very well done. You could truly feel each character's personality and plight. I also enjoyed how history on the buffalo soldier was weaved throughout the book. Great read -- kept my attention from start to finish. In fact, I was sorry to see it end, but did very much enjoy how it ended.",
            "The Buffalo Soldier was an easy, solid read. It's the story of a young African American foster child, Alfred, who after being shuffled around from home to home, lands at the Sheldon residence. Although Terry, a Vermont State Trooper, and Laura, director of an animal shelter, appear at first glance to be perfectly qualified foster parents, the case isn't quite so true. The drowning of the Sheldon twins two years earlier has left Laura in a fog of depression resulting in marital deterioration. Will the arrival of Alfred help to resolve their issues or will it worsen their situation?And what about Alfred? Follow him in his journey of adjusting to a predominantly white town, prejudice, and an unlikely friendship that inspires him to overcome through the study of the true Buffalo Soldiers. I commend Bohjalian for his very real depiction of foster children and their behavior. Alfred must exist in every foster child.What I liked about this novel is that it's a very likely, possible account of the challenges a marriage is faced with after the death of a child. The topic of prejudice and friendship seal the deal on a captivating storyline.",
            "When I first picked this book up, I wasn't quite sure if I would be interested in reading it. It sounds so depressing ~~ a couple loses their twin daughters to a flash flood and two years later, they end up being foster parents of an African-American boy. Then shortly after they become foster parents, the couple go through tumultous times in their marriage due to the husband's infidelity. It doesn't sound like an uplifting book at all. And I wasn't quite sure where the Buffalo Soldier came in.After reading a few pages ~~ I was hooked. Laura and Terry, the couple becomes as real to me as the neighbors. Alfred, the foster son, who the story is centered around becomes the kid everyone would love to have. Even Phoebe, Terry's girlfriend, has a voice and she is just as real as the other characters in the book. And throughout the book is little intercepts of letters from The Buffalo Soldier, who did exist during the Wild West days. The Buffalo Soldiers were given their names from the Native Americans, who admired them. They were African-Americans sent to capture/kill the natives while protecting the settlers out west. Alfred reads the book that the neighbor professor had given him and he models himself after one of the soldiers. This soldier is a man of virtue ~~ a role model.This book is full of feelings and emotions ~~ it is a book I did not regret picking up. It is a book about life and death, survival and love, gentleness and hatred, fear and sorrow. It's a complex book ~~ one that takes some time to let sink in and it's just as good as The Midwives, which is his first book. It's about healing and letting go and forgiveness. It is an inspiring book ~~ a book of stout character. One that I will not soon forget!5-18-03",
            "In rural northern Vermont Terry and Laura Sheldon tragically lost their twin 9 year old daughters in a flash flood two years earlier. As they both progess along their own paths of grief, they decide to open up their hearts and their home to another child. They decide to take in a 10 year old African American foster child named Alfred after they cannot conceive another child on their own. Due to Alfred's past of neglect and the constant shuffling from foster home to foster home, he is reluctant to open himself up to the Sheldon's and his new home. He feels left out by the other kids at school -- either due to his race or the fact that he his a foster child (or a combination of both) remains unclear --but Alfred takes comfront in his neighbor Paul, a retired college professor. As their friendship grew Paul teaches Alfred about some of his history by the means of the Buffalo Soldiers.Meanwhile the marriage of Terry and Laura continues to disintegrate even after Alfred has joined their family. Terry has a one night stand with a younger woman named Phoebe who ends up pregnant. Now Terry to torn between Laura and Phoebe. But the decision is not all in his hands as these women have a say on their futures in the end. To top it all off Terry has failed to bond with Alfred while at the same time Laura begins to think of Alfred as her son.... I think one of Bohjalian's strengths was his protrayal of the floods. I could 'see' the cresting riverbanks and destroyed property. Bohjalian really hit the mark! Notwithstanding, I was slightly disappointed in the lack of character development. I often felt that Laura, Alfred and Terry were one-dimensional and 'flat'. Also, the ending was a bit disturbing but it contained a wonderful climatic atmosphere the last 100 pages or so that keep me reading well into the night. Although THE BUFFALO SOLDIER does not live up to the brilliance of THE MIDWIVES, it still remains a good book that I would recommend to others.",
            "This book takes hold of the reader, right from the first page. It tells the story of everyday people living through the hard parts of life. It is strong story of family, and the fact that in todays world what makes a family has changed.Being from Vermont perhaps jades my love of the book, but I've got to say that Mr Bohjalian know this State, and understands the people who live in it.",
            "I loved this book, but the whole time I was reading it, I kept thinking that the success of the book depended on the ending. And then after I finished it, I was thoroughly disappointed. It felt like the ending of a movie, not a great book. Since I don't want to \"give away\" the ending, I would have liked the same final outcome, but without all the drama. It just didn't seem realistic to me, which was a shame since the book as a whole IS realistic.In the author's defense, however, it seems that it is much easier to write a good book than to end a book well. Many novels are spoiled by unrealistic, over the top, endings.",
            "What a melancholy tale! Halfway through the book, I honestly didn't know if I'd be able to finish it-I was too afraid that something even more devastating was going to happen. But Bohjalian's writing compelled me to carry on, and I'm glad I did.Like life, this novel is not neat and tidy, but bittersweet. Certain loose ends do not get tied. The characters are complex and likeable-even though Terry is cheating on his wife you feel a certain empathy for him. Both he and Laura are just doing what they can in order to deal with the indelible grief that afflicts them.Ultimately, this is a story about healing, about perservering. If you take the time to work your way through the painful stuff, you will feel rewarded by the end.",
            "This book had enough action and enough human interest to keep me involved. I thought the author did a fair job telling the story though the lens of the various characters. Character development was enough to create empathy but not quite enough to \"get into their shoes\". Therefore, it did not touch me as deeply as it could have. It seemed that the women were a little too histrionic and the men were too removed. But then, who knows how a mother feels when her children have died, how a father feels in that same situation, how a young unwed pregnant woman feels, how a husband feels when he is displaced by a child, how a foster kid feels after being abandoned and passed along to different homes? I suppose those thoughts and questions are the benefits given to the reader by the author.I felt that the weakest part of the book was the Buffalo Soldier tie in. The title really did not seem to fit with the book. I tried to understand how the WPA journal entries and old letters interjected into the chapters connected or even illumined the plot, but I was left dry. If they were absent, the book would not have suffered.",
            "This was a story that seems unlikely, but for that very reason tends to ring true.We have all heard of tragedies that seem almost overwhelming in other families,situations so dreadful that no author could imagine them.Bohjalian does. This is a story of a family tragedy that becomes a life changing, and loving situation for a boy that starts out as a stranger and becomes a son. Twin daughters are swept away in a flood in the first pages. The town rallies to console the family in the early days, but as is true in real situation of this sort, support falls away as people realize that there is nothing that they can do to assuage the grief following such loss.This family finds its way out of darkness into the light and in doing so, the lives of an elderly neighbor and a young foster child are changed along with theirs. The ending is absolutely heart stopping, and was for me, unexpected. This is a compelling read with all too real characters. It is a can't put it down book, like all of Bohjalian's books.",
            "I found myself struggling to complete this book. I'm a big fan of Chris Bohjalian but was disappointed with this book.",
            "This novel captures the human element well indeed as a married couple try to replace two daughters lost by bringing in a young boy to live with them. The construct of this story was unique (for me) as each chapter was specifically about one character in the story where you got to know and appreciate every single person involved. It was a great innovation to me and helped in the development of the story.This is a true-to-life story of what happens to individuals and families when infidelity occurs that disrupts the lives of many people and puts them on the avenue of chaos and doubt. A good read.",
            "We chose this for our monthly book club selection. It was a good choice for discussion and liked by all.",
            "I have nearly all of Chris Bohjalian's books- they are top reads, and this is definitely one of my favorites.",
            "Excellent read, the end kind of peters out but this is the style of Bojalian......a lot of crises that just flutters away into normalcy at the end. I enjoyed the book immensely though.",
            "I never know what to expect when I pick up a book by this author because I really like some of his books and really dislike others. For example, his book 'Midwives' received high ratings and great reviews, but I found it predictable and boring. This book, however, I really enjoyed. The basic story is that a couple is dealing with the sudden loss of their young twin daughters during a spring flood. They are devastated and their marriage is strained as they both try to cope with the loss. Eventually, they bring a foster child into their home. He is a young black boy from the city coming to live with a white couple in a small rural town in Vermont. They all struggle with trying to build relationships with each other. The husband has a \"one night fling\" while out on a hunting trip, which he deeply regrets and wants desperately to put behind him. Unfortunately, that one night results in a pregnancy that really complicates his life. Usually that kind of story line would result in dislike and disgust for the husband, but in this story you feel his pain and regret and are torn about whether you should be angry at him or feel sorry for him. It is an unusual story and all the characters, the husband, wife, pregnant young woman, foster child, and neigher who gives the boy a book about the black calvary known as the Buffalo Soldiers, are all complex and very human. It was a good read.",
            "I really, really enjoyed this book. I found that I cared so much for all of the characters, each of whom was just a regular human being experiencing reasonable emotional reactions to things that happened in their lives, and responding in understandable, if not always entirely appropriate, ways. I was so engrossed in this book. Each day I was so anxious to get home so that I could find out what happened next. And I don't want to spoil the ending for anyone, but I think it was just right, just the way it should have been.I was attracted to this book at first because my husband and I are in the process of adopting from foster care and I am reading everything I can find on the topic. But even if that were not the case, I would recommend it as a wonderful story and enjoyable read."
