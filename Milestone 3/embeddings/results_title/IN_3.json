        "description": "\"What was gunpowder?\" Trivial. What was electricity? Meaningless. This atomic bomb is the Second Coming in wrath.\" - Winston Churchill, July 1945 Commencing earnestly in the1960s, the American novel began its exploration into how mankind could adjustto life in the shadow of the mushroom cloud, how we could begin to think aboutthe Unthinkable. American writers faced squarely the age birthed by nuclearphysics and found in its very darkness difficult avenues to hope byrediscovering that most potent, traditional response to a history in crisis:the apocalyptic temper. Dewey focuses on seven novelsthat touch the variety of generic experiments and postures of the post-WorldWar II American novel. These novels by Vonnegut, Coover, Percy, Pynchon,Gaddis, and DeLillo represent a significant argument concerning the Americanliterary response to living within the oppressive technologies of the NuclearAge. Departing from other studies that veer toward speculative fiction ortoward the more narrowly defined religious angles, In a Dark Time defines the apocalyptic temper as a most traditionalliterary genre that articulates the anxieties of a community in crisis, a wayfor that community to respond to the perception of a history gone critical byturning squarely to that history and to find, in that gesture, the way toward agenuine hope. Dewey's new approach consistsof applying the theory of apocalyptic literature to a body of essentiallysecular writings. Dewey resists the traditional approach - studying worksdealing with nuclear devastation - to focus on how a generation of literaryresponses have dealt with the larger questions about how to live with therecognition of End times. Dewey convincingly demonstrates that this literaturereminds its moments in history that only in a dark time will the eye begin tosee.",

            "If you'll only ever buy one book on apocalypse and apocalyptic phenomena, this is the one. A brilliant theological investigation in how the Western world, and especially the U.S. has been shaped, molded and thought through the storylines of John of Patmos' 'revolting revelations'. Keller's reading employs (among other) feminist and poststructuaralist perspectives to a biblical text that can neither be completely dismissed nor entirely embraced. Instead she argues for a 'counterapocalyptic' approach that avoids the closures of either a 'straightforward apocalypse' or an 'anti-apocalypse.' This is a powerful, exciting, astonishingly honest, thoughtful and brilliant text well worth the work it takes to grapple with its poetic cadences.A text from a most powerful contemporary theological voice, who is also a singularly inventive, smart and witty writer.Oh, and lest you think there is no need to read a book on apocalypse after we made it into 2000, this book will convince you that the influence and impact of apocalyptic thinking is far stronger, deeper and more subtle than much of the hullabaloo about 'the end is near' might make you think. This book lays bare some of the foundational ideas of the Western world without which our world would not be what it is. At times a tough read, but worth every effort.",
            "This is the book that changed my life forever. I read it many years ago, and it continues to reverberate in my theological practice. Apocalypse means \"unveiling.\" As Keller says, this was the verb of the groom unveiling his bride. The next thing we know, that same groom is tearing open the earth for weatlth and pleasure. Thus economic development is revealed in the dark light of pillage. I have never read such an eloquent plea for the earth and her creatures, the earth itself as the Body of Christ. The book reads like a dream, revelatory, deconstructing the strictures of linear thinking to show its underlying chaos and self-interest. As a result of reading this, I began to do theology as dreamwork, an idea that Keller herself takes up in more recent writings, notably God and Power.",
            "Reading Catherine Keller's Apocalypse Now and Then often reminded me of what it is like to read something in a language in which I am not proficient. What was different about this experience is that the book is written in English, my native language. Despite the convenience of reading a text in a language in which I am familiar, I was unable to understand much of what Keller was talking about. There seemed to be no concrete topic in her paragraphs, and the section breaks made no sense. Often the information in the beginning of one section was a direct continuation of the content of the previous section, despite a large printed number and several line spaces separating the sections. There was more continuity between sentences from one section to the next than there was within the sections themselves. I was left repeatedly with the same question, \"What are you talking about?\"When I first prepared to read Apocalypse Now and Then, I was excited to get into the material. I anticipated work similar to other feminist writers I have enjoyed such as, Elizabeth Johnson, Carol Christ, Nancy Howell and Penelope Washbourn. I have no way to compare Keller's work to these or any other scholars because of my inability to break thorough the barrier I encountered when reading the text.I will admit that the very phrase \"end times\" associated with apocalyptic literature is a good place to start when discussing what I did appreciate about \"Apocalypse Now and Then.\" Despite my feeling moderately illiterate as a result of reading Keller, I feel the experience was worth the attempt I made because of the content in the preface regarding eschatos. Keller notes that her book, \"does take place within such a spiritual boundary... a horizon that always recedes again into a `not yet' that `already is,' or is nothing at all (xiii).\" Though I am not sure what Keller means to say by this, I came to think of eschatology or apocalypse as a continuous cycle similar to her use of metaphor of the horizon. I had thought that it was her intention to depict apocalypse in this way, but when I came back to it I was unable to find her statement how I remembered it. Regardless, I know see that we are always a part of the end times as well as the rebirth. Whether temporally, or physiologically, we are in a constant state of change. As one moment in time, or one arrangement of physical structure, the world as it was dies for a moment, as a new world is born. This new world is quite like the old, and similar to the next, but unique to itself, never to be repeated.This is somewhat illustrated in Keller's description of how the Spirit works to reveal truth through texts from the Bible. As one reads, in this case the book of Revelation, one is moved only in the way or to the degree that one can see the meaning of the text in that moment in time. \"The pneumatic reading I have undertaken of Revelation's text and of its extrabiblical effects assumes, however, that the Bible never has been and never can be insulated from its surrounding lifeworlds (287).\" One cannot take oneself out of the interpretation of the text, especially if one recognizes any aspect of a spiritual component to life. Understanding can only be understood from that exact temporal and physical location from which one experiences the text. It is through this experience that the Spirit enters into the formula. It is through the relational experience of engaging the text that we know the Spirit (285).Despite the limitations to my ability to read Apocalypse Now and Then with confidence, there are a few other points in the book that caught my attention. I found it curious that Keller's description of the literary form of the apocalyptic did not discuss the context of the genera. Much of apocalyptic literature was a form of political writing in which an author would criticize the current context in a future fictional setting. This allowed the author to write harsh criticisms of a political system or society, while maintaining a distance from the true subject as a result of the fictionalization of events in a future context. This provided protection from authorities, who would have ample justification for retaliation should the criticisms be literal or unhidden. This has hardly anything to do with the end things as described by Keller. Instead Keller associates the apocalyptic as a literary genre with the eschatological mythology of Zoroastranism (21). Keller implies that those seeking social justice and political change have at times used apocalyptic literature as inspiration or justification, but the possibility that the book of Revelation was intended to be an immediate tool for such action is not explored (as far as I understood Keller's intentions).One aspect of Apocalypse Now and Then that I appreciated was Keller's description of an ebb and flow in the willingness of individuals to participate in actions geared towards social change. With our tendency to want that victory over evil that we associate with our underlying understanding of the end, we desire for all of our actions to result in the final cessation of all that causes pain and suffering in our world. When faced with the reality that despite our efforts, there is always going to be pain and suffering, social, political, and religious participation may seem pointless (14). The mode of change is beyond us, why try?The resolution to this dilemma is illustrated in Keller's story of her second trip to El Salvador. Marta Benevides is said to be a woman who works with the people of El Salvador, trying to make life better. She approaches her work not as a movement towards a time when the work is done, but as a way of life. She says she is being rather than struggling, and instead of fighting for change, she lives the way (280). If we think back to the horizon that always recedes again, we see how Marta Benevides maintains her way of life. Only when we recognize that this is the apocalypse, the process that is the end of the old and the beginning of the new, will we be able to fully participate in the moment. We will be able to live the way, as Marta Benevides puts it. When we stop preparing for what is to come, and live what is, we will shed the burden of waiting for a judgment. Whether we see the judgment as an event that will justify us or liberate us, it keeps us from fully participating in what is in this moment.",

            "I'm certain that, buried somewhere deep in her convoluted prose, Keller has important and profound understandings to share about the nature of apocalypse. Unfortunately, this text is written in the language of a person so immersed in academia that she has forgotten how to communicate clearly and concisely to those outside of the world of research journals and symposiums. Keller's approach is to say in a paragraph what could be said in a sentence and to write with such a vocabulary that most readers will need to keep a dictionary close at hand just to decipher what she is trying to say."

More than just an amazing love story, Avalanche is so well written that I could feel the cold and see the mountains. Beautiful novel."

The surface is dominated by a group collectively called the Mutes (for Mutants) and the Iron Lords (Japanese that occupy the eastern US). Steve Brickman, the hero starts out as a shining member of the USA's flying force (called a Cloud Warrior by the Mutes), but finds himself in a number of intrigues that run a total of 6 books. Great reading. duellist@interserv.co",
            "I read many SF books, many of these involve a post-apocalyptic earth. None of these books has kept me as enthralled as the Amtrak Wars series has. Patrick Tilley gives such depth and detail to his characters and locations that you find yourself rooting for Steve Brickman and his mute friends as they face the might of the Federation. I would definitely recommend this and the other books but only if you have a lot of free time on your hands because I guarantee that you will not be able to put it down and, when you have finnished it, you will want to start all over again (I did). Five stars.",
            "Steven Roosevelt Brickman returns to the Amtrak Federation after five months of captivity by the Mutes. He thinks he will be a hero - a brave survivor bringing back valuable intelligence that the Mutes are a lot smarter and have a lot more resources than is believed. Instead, he is stripped of everything and consigned to the A-levels to work out his life as the lowest of the low, maintaining the environmental systems the allow the underground Federation to function. And then he is offered a way out, plus a return to the overground. Steve's loyalties are about to be put under even more pressure than before . . .\"First Family\" is as good as \"Cloud Warrior\", though it feels more claustrophobic. That's no surprise, though, as that's exactly how Steve is feeling himself as he re-enters his old life. There's perhaps a little less action, but action is not really the point of this book. Despite the importance of the plot, \"First Family\" is a scene-setter: from it, we learn a lot more about the Mutes and the Amtrak Federation, and especially the manipulations that have affected Steve's life since birth. The First Family - whom we actually meet - view him as a tiny cog in a very large machine, theirs to use at will. Whether he proves to be valuable or dangerous, they'll use him as much as possible. And Steve is still too naive to realise exactly what his situation is.\"First Family\" also sets up the action for the coming books. Roz and Jodi are reintroduced, and we meet two other Trackers who will be very important later, Kelso and Malone. And Steve accepts a dangerous mission from Mr Snow which is played out in the third book, \"Iron-Master\".It's sad and frustrating to see how Steve is manipulated by those around him, despite his cleverness. But he is determined to find the truth and run his own life, and that has just as much impact on the plot as those manipulations.The setting and plot of \"First Family\" are as intriguing as as those of \"Cloud-Warrior\". Just try to ignore the nastiness of the relationship between Steve and Roz.",

            "MacDonald Reid's Jihad: World War in 2036, in an excellent narrative. Unfortunately, while the idea is there, the book suffers from lack of a compelling story. Putting aside, the lack of differences as to how the military would actully function in 2036, the book, instead of being a story, simply descibes all of the events. You can never relate to any of the characters, good or bad, and they all seem cartoonish (with every other line ending in an exclaimation mark). The book's saving grace is that the author obviously shows that he knows the subject area, and put considerably thought as to how things might be different 40 years from now (though, I think he should have gone allot farther). I just wish that he took this interesting concept and applied it to the characters.",

It is pitched at a high-school comprehension level, but the ending is both philosophically and practically tidy - a way forward even for we who never suffered through the horrors of a nuclear war. But maybe we will have to rediscover an Edwardian political simplicity to find that path, as Arakal and his cabinet do in this book. Certainly the justification for the enforced stasis of the Soviets in this book is sound if only on an Earthly level.By the way, I never buy into those books that project so complete a breakdown after a nuclear war that books and libraries don't survive. I read the studies - while a complete war would kill billions, most of the deaths would be due to systems breakdowns and not fallout or nuclear winter. People might fall ill and starve, but things would survive better.",

            "I picked up this book believing that it was going to be right up my alley. I knew it was a post-apocalyptic story dealing with cloning and the nature of collectivism and individuality. I love the post apocalyptic genre. I have a biology degree. I tend to side with the libertarian political philosophy. Indeed, this book should be a perfect match. What I found was that this is the worst of the 15 or so Hugo winners I've read.First, I did not like the characters, but this might just be personal taste. There are also some ecological problems, as mentioned in other reviews, but I tended to ignore these since the book did not dwell too much on how the apocalyptic world came to be. My main problem is with the central subject of the book, and I am utterly surprised that none have the other reviewers have addressed it. The author seems to have no understanding of what cloning is!A clone is an exact genetic copy of an organism, produced either through natural or artificial means. Mutations that occur are usually deleterious(i.e. missing a tooth, albinism). Advantageous mutations are expected to be minor and rare(i.e. slightly more brain mass). Twins are clones and the differences in them are almost entirely environmental.Here is the author's idea of clones: [From pg 60 of the original hardback] W1 informs David that Walt has cancer. W1 is surprised that David did not already know. \"I keep forgetting, you [the elders] don't tell each other things, do you?\" W1 is stating that the clones tell each other everything about themselves. Recognize that W1 is not just including the Walt clones but all clones. This passage seems to be inferring that clones band collectively together from the nature of being clones. How did this special \"collective trait\" come about? Maybe the clones are banding together due to environmental means. Let's look at another passage.[pg 66] \"Preservation of the species is a very strong instinct, a drive, if you will,\" states D1 to David. David replies that the clones are not a separate species. I wish the author would have listened to David instead of D1. For the rest of the book, the author displays D1's point, that clones have an instinct to preserve all other clones. This is one of the most explicit passages where the author states that it is an innate quality (genetics) that makes the clones different. She also states earlier that the clones are able to learn quicker, and near the end, the more distant clone generations became more specialized.Let me try to put together the author's view on human clones: Clones, by their very nature, band together into communistic societies. It does not matter how distantly related one clone set is from another, this special \"collective trait\" is common among all of them. A clone will act for the benefit of another clone for the reason that he is a clone like himself. Clones do lose their drives for personal expression and initiative but seem to excel more in specialized abilities and learning, again common among all clones.Please compare this to my description of clones. Could it be that the author strangely believes that artificial insemination/incubation leads to the above? It could be very possible. In vitro fertilization was a big news item at the time it was written with the first successful one in 1978. It might have also helped if she read Wilson's \"Sociobiology\" or Dawkin's \"The Selfish Gene\" so that she would not fall into the pitfall of group selectionism, but these might have been published slightly later. Group selectionism is a concept almost completely dead today.Am I wrong in my analysis? The other reviews reflect that I'm alone. I would love to hear any explanations of where I went wrong. But remember, her book is about clones. They are not genetically engineered beings, artificially selected superhumans from a eugenics experiment, or cyborgs. Did people (and do people today) really believe that if human clones were successfully conceived, they would be inhuman, group-think zombies? Maybe this was the common belief in the 1930's, but the '70's? I do have some serious ethical problems with cloning, but promoting archaic, wrongheaded notions only distracts from the real arguments.",
            "This book was very seventies, it extrapolated the worst case scenario for just about everything and might give forty-somethings a bad flashback. I had trouble swallowing the notion of a clone society, bent on preserving their (impractical and technologically-dependent)asexual form of reproduction at all costs, being so promiscuous from a very young age, both within and across gender. It seems that for a society trying so hard to be sexless, they are very much sexually-dependent. The best characters die by two thirds of the way through, and the climax is basically absent. The clones in the first part grew astonishingly fast and the rather lengthy narrative dealing with the Native American wannabe was boring. The illustration of the importance of individualism vs uniformity/conformity was noteworthy. I kept waiting for the punchline, but it never came; I didn't even get the emotional gratification I demand from a good novel. I'd give it three stars out of five.",

            "What a great story. I vould not put it down. Maybe a bit dated (written in 76 or 77) but a marvellous post-holocaust story. The woman can WRITE!!",
            "Much of this world's history has been shaped by the constant attempts to shift the balance between the individual as an autonomous, self-directing, self-centered, and unique unit and the group society, where everyone's efforts go towards the general welfare, where the individual is merely a replaceable cog. This book takes this battle to the extreme, to where, via cloning, there really are no individuals, only copies, where anyone who disturbs the group is subject to extreme measures, from execution to severe behavioral/mind control to expulsion to the wilderness. True individuals come to be considered 'defective', as they cannot always accept the wishes of the group, they keep coming up with disturbingly new and different ideas, and they place themselves ahead of the group.To bring about this society, Wilhelm starts with a fairly normal (for science fiction) scenario: due to man's constant pollution of the environment, new diseases appear, eventually either directly killing everyone (and almost all the land animal life also) or rendering them sterile. One group sees a way to save humanity by using cloning techniques, with some promise that after enough generations of cloning, some sexual reproductive capability will reappear.From this starting point, the book is told in three distinct parts. The first section covers the period when the cloning facilities are being set up against a background of a world society in the throes of collapse. Part two is a look after several clone generations have occurred and an expedition is made to one of ruined cities to salvage needed high-tech supplies for the continuing cloning operation. The expedition exposes both the strength and the weakness of the clone groups, as they find it almost impossible to remain sane when separated from their clone 'brothers' and 'sisters'. One expedition member, Molly, grows so far away from her sisters under the stress that she really becomes an individual. Part three covers the final battle between clones and individuals, as Molly's son Mark grows up as the only 'single' in the group.Thematically, this book is tautly conceived and executed. The later generations of the clones exemplify the problems of extreme homogeneity, as they find themselves, though extremely intelligent and quick learners, incapable of creative thought and independent action. The down sides of the individual are also exposed, showing the limitations on what one person can do when separated from the group. All of this is displayed pretty much by the character's actions, though there is some exposition via council meetings that are more philosophical statements than planning sessions.Character development is reasonable, given that most of the clones must remain essentially 'faceless' and the time span covered means that no character lasts more than a third of the book. But this also means that no character is explored in extreme depth, which makes it hard for the reader to become emotionally attached to anyone.Scientifically, there are problems with this book. An ecology is an extremely complex intertwined entity. When all the land animals die off (including, by specific mention, bees), there will be large affects on the plant population. Many plants can't reproduce at all without the help of certain animal species. The grasses, without a large group of herbivores to keep them in check, would very likely choke out many other plant species. Pollination becomes extremely problematic without bees. Wilhelm attempts to get around this by stating that function is taken over by ants, which would be at best much less efficient than that which occurs with bees. But Wilhelm shows none of these foreseeable affects - the forests and grain fields continue to grow apparently undisturbed. None of these problems directly affects the theme of this book, but it bothered my suspension of disbelief, especially as it was only necessary to kill off all the people, she could have left the animals alone, to get the situation she needed.This book took the 1977 Hugo Award, and as well told exposition of one the major philosophical battles that man faces today and in the future, it deserved it. But it is a definite 'thinking' book, not one of action, grand drama, or deep psychology. Expect to do some internal reflection when you finish this book, and see how you stack up as an individual versus your place in and responsibilities to your surrounding society.",
            "I am not a big Kate Wilhelm fan, but she poured her heart and soul into this book.Although the book deals with the subject of Cloning, it is really about the triumph of individualism in a clone society.The story revolves around a little boy that was raised in secret by his rebellious mother, and the efforts of the clone society to make him fit in. Once discovered he becomes a big problem for the clone society, but the clone society also needs his unique talents. And as he grows into a man, the situation becomes worse and worse, until it comes to a head in the end.As a book about individualism, this book is even better than Ayn Rands Anthem. Anthem will leave the reader sing praises of individualism. While this book leave the reader with a heartfelt appreciation of individualism and a deep understanding of the tension between of individualism and collectivism. It will touch your heart, your soul, and you mind.I've read a lot of books, very few of them I'd rate as good, but this book is far better than good. Find this book, and read it today.",
            "American literature of the 60's and 70's has a distinctive flavour of individualism, partly as a product of the worship of the individual heroes (Washington, Davey Crockett, etc.) that explored and/or created the country, and partly as a reaction to the perceived \"homogeneity\" of communism. By definition, the theory went, a person could not possibly be happy unless he was first free. This award-winning book by Kate Wilhelm is a parable of the triumph of individualism over the collective.This is not a new theme for science fiction - the Original Star Trek series had a number of such episodes, and the Grand Master Robert Heinlein visited this topic numerous times. \"Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang\" has similarities to the Classic Trek episode \"The Apple\" and Heinlein's \"Farnham's Freehold.\" But mainly I was reminded of Robert Silverberg's \"A Time of Changes\" - in both tales a society is developed and then from within that society arises an individual who must destroy the complacency of the society to save its people. In Wilhelm's book, an ecological catastrophe (and a development of human infertility) destroys the human race except a group of scientists that propogate themselves in the only way possible - by cloning. Thus a society of clones: family groups are a batch of 6-10 identical clones raised as a unit. Wilhelm introduces the notion of genetic ESP - basically accepting the supposed (but unproven) link that twins feel for each other (e.g. when one is hurt, the other senses something is wrong). Unfortunately, by cloning the exact same genetic material over and over, subsequent generations of clones become more and more specialised (one group is doctors, one group builds barns, etc.) until no one in the society has any initiative or imagination.Into this society is introduced an anomaly - actually two. A woman has a traumatic experience that allows her latent individuality to surface. She is impregnated and gives birth to a son - the only \"singleton\" child in the entire human race. The book mostly follows the lives of these two characters as they rebel against their society and the fear they bring. They know, but no one else can see, that the society is a dead end and they must destroy the cloning system in order to free the potential of the surviving members of the human race.Wilhelm's book is not perfect - as others have pointed out, the science is pretty simplistic (if not wrong!). You also get the uncomfortable feeling that she hates her creation (the clone society), which leads to an overly \"black and white\" interpretation: individuality = good, collectivism = bad. But I think this book is meant to be a parable, and as such need not be realistic or subtle. Wilhelm's writing is concise, suspenseful, and very enjoyable. While I think \"A Time of Changes\" covers much of the same material and does it better, there is no doubt that \"Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang\" is an easier and more enjoyable read.",
            "Science fiction isn't really always about science. The best sci-fi is about humanity, and a futuristic or technological bent allows the author to explore particular aspects of humankind.Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang is that kind of great science fiction, focusing on humans in a sci-fi setting. The book is about cloning, more or less. But actually, the themes run far deeper than a mere op/ed piece on a technological possibility. Cloning is used as the vehicle to explore the meaning of individuality, the uniqueness of a person, and the consequences of complete homogeneity.If you like hard edge technological sci-fi, this book isn't for you. But if you're looking for excellent fiction that happens to be in the genre, I'd give this book a hearty recommendation.",
            "Pollution, industrialization, over population, famine. These are just a few of the causes that converge to doom most of the animal life of Earth. A few 'visionaries' foresee this apocalypse, including mass sterility of both plant and animal life. Their research leads to great advances in cloning, which they see as the only means of continuing many species, including man. Eventually, they realize that the cloned humans are more Clone than Human. Clones develop different mentally and emotionally, eventually creating an entirely different, even alien, society. A collective mindset evolves, only to be challenged by the introduction of a true individualist, a rare child of sexual reproduction raised out of the group culture for the first five years of his life.The scenario brings to mind some of Ayn Rand's work regarding individualism verses collectivism. However, Ms Wilhelm's work is far less preachy and much more gripping.Highly recommended for aficionados of post-apocalyptic or cloning fiction.",
            "Those familiar with Wilhelm's large catalogue of mystery novels probably don't even know that she won the Hugo Award for best science fiction novel in 1976/77 with this entry. Although this falls into the science fiction genre, it really is able to transcend all the normal SF stereotypes and ends up being a fantastic read.The book is about a post-holocaust community that aims to perpetuate the human species through cloning. The book is divided into three sections with the first being the best and this could stand alone as a novella by itself although I wouldn't say the book is entirely uneven.Despite what other reviewers have posted, I think there is some basic cloning science in this but its comprehension in needed to fully appreciate the book. Wilhelm is smart not to delve too hard into the science as capturing the humanistic side of her characters is clearly her strength.The book expounds on the individual vs. the collective theme and this is one of the reasons why it doesn't feel dated. With cloning on the technological horizon, this book provides an interesting fictional take on the pitfalls of scientific procreation vs. natural childbirth.Bottom Line: A short book about cloning mixed with a strong dose of humanity. A great book for non-sf readers looking to expand their horizons. A must read for anyone who likes to read the Hugo winners.",
            "I went into the reading of this book as a dreaded high school assignment some time ago, and came away with a haunting image of a society losing individuality and imagination. I was infuriated by the idea that the loss of the characteristics which make us unique was acceptable, expected, and desired. It made me think of what my own ideas of cloning really were, at a time when the subject was just becoming feasible. Have you ever pondered what a society of, say, ten people created over and over into hundreds would be like? This book gives just one view of that situation. As limited as that view may seem, it really opened my mind, and helped me to understand where I want to be in this issue. I HIGHLY suggest reading it, especially if you have followed any of the latest developments in regards to the subject of cloning.",
            "I searched high and low to find this book, and considering that it won the 1977 Hugo, I'm surprised it was so hard to find. I hope that word-of-mouth spreads for this book and that it is republished again soon.The book deals with many different themes and issues, and at times is reminicient of &quot;1984&quot; and &quot;On the Beach&quot; but at its heart it is a book about a society of clones. And as usual, in matters of new science frontiers, of what society fears and Congress outlaws, science-fiction bridges the gap and asks and answers the questions of ethics and morality that arise.Doomsday comes and mankind's only hope for survivial is to resort to cloning as its form of reproduction. But a society of clones becomes an almost entirely different species, who live as a collective. But among the clones emerges an individual who challenges the society that he lives in, and exerts his freedom to live and think as an individual. And the battle of collective minds against the individual quickly becomes the battle for the survival of mankind, once again.Considering the attention that cloning has been getting lately, I urge all fans of sci-fi to seek out old copies of this book, or to encourage the publishers to release a new printing. The book earned its Hugo Award, as twenty years ago it was raising the same questions that are being asked today. The first third of the book seems rushed, and is more of a long prologue than anything, but the last two-thirds of the book are as challenging a subject as any novel in the genre.",
            "&quot;Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang&quot; chronicles the post-holocaust attempts of humanity's remnants to combat sterility through cloning. The author, Kate Wilhelm, posits that multiple and simultaneous cloning of an individual prevents the development of separate egos in the clones, and results instead in the formation of a group identity. She argues this point and the consequent deterioration of the clone society quite convincingly. The successful execution of this idea would alone make a fine novel. When supported by Wilhelm's lush, vivid imagery and gripping drama it becomes a masterpiece.Damon Knight (Wilhelm's husband and himself a famous author) claimed that the best SF evokes in the reader a &quot;sense of wonder&quot;, a reverence of mankind's potential- and engenders despair in the bosom of the aspiring writer who can never hope to duplicate this feat. The inspiration of this awe is the greatest virtue of &quot;Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang&quot;, and entitles it to a position among the genre's highest achievements.",
            "Kate Wilhelm describes in this story a clone society, which some authors might make out to be a utopia, but which she makes it clear is far from being one. She employs beautiful, descriptive passages describing a range of experiences which derive much of their value from being experienced in solitude: a walk in the woods, drawing a picture, dreaming a lazy dream... Her story leaves one with an experience of the importance of privacy, of having an alone place in your life, and of turning, sometimes, away from the quotidian world of other people and even of sensory input, and finding out how to be still and centered. She seems to be implying that, in some paradoxical ways, the most powerful common experience we can share as human beings is the experience of reflective solitude.She sets all of this in the context of a society of clones. I should say that this society reminds me a lot of the &quot;Borg&quot; from Star Trek, while noting, of course, that Kate Wilhelm's story was written long before the idea of the Borg occurred to anyone. The clone society concept lets her do all kinds of complex, intriguing things with her ideas, but these actual ideas are quite simple in and of themselves. Simple, important, and worth reading. This book is terrific. Two thumbs up.",
            "This audiobook left me with a lot to think about. I would get home and sit in the garage for 15+ minutes after a 1 hour commute from work, just to finish a chapter. Read it or listen to it. Fantastic.",
            "Willhelm has written an interesting take on the implications of cloning and the loss of human individuality. Set in a world where environmental factors have forced a large extended family to create a kind of end-of-the-world compound where they can work on curing the eventual sterility of the entire human race by cloning, the author explores what it means to be human, and the importance of natural sexual reproduction. The 3 main storylines deal with subsequent generations of this family clone farm.Most chilling is her hypothesis on what status \"breeders\" will hold in a world where everyone can be genetically manipulated for a particular job (yes, there is a little Brave New World flavor here). Those who bear children are looked at more as cattle to keep the gene pool diverse than as the revered few able to reproduce. In the end even the clones become like cattle to those who can control human reproduction with a few twists of a dial and then use conditioning to turn them into whatever kind of human (or non-human) bests suits the needs of the \"community\".Overall Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang is an enjoyably quick and thought-provoking read, with a bit of a fable-like quality throughout.",
            "Kate Wilhelm sketches a very believable start of post apocalypic survival group that starts cloning themselves, because they no longer are furtile. And how these cloned descendends start their own type of society, in which individualism only exists in a few prosecuted deviates, people increasingly are breeded for special purposes and become more and more dispensable (there are always other copies left). The community cannot survive in the long run, because valuable human assets, such as the ability to have new ideas, and to reach out beyond what is teached, become extinct.The thing that bothered me a bit, was that the decline of the society was based on the above described premisses, of the lack of original ideas, and intelligence after several cloned generations. This is not 'logically' or 'necessarily' anchored in the story. There seems to be no real reason for it, except that it happens, which imvho does not qualify as a reason. It feels like a plot device.But, on the upside Wilhelm does a good job in dipicting the horrors of being a number, and the value of being an individual. The cloned society is believable, and engrossing. Wilhelm's writing style makes the book very accessible. Giving food for thought.",
            "Brillaint book especially when you consider when it was written. A great indicator of what can happen to society as the result of its dependence on technology.

            "In 1976 Kate Wilhelm wrote a science-fiction masterpiece that still delivers a powerful message to today's audience. This book details the end of our society in an incredibly prophetic voice. What works best about this novel, is the touching struggle of the three main characters as they fight to survive and to hold on to their own humanity.",
            "Great book, and everyone else who's reviewing here is right. However, the reader should be warned: This book does not delve into characters very well. Many are introduced, very few are explored. In hindsight, that was part of the whole point, that individuality is lost, but while reading, it was a little hard to get into. Still, I raced through the book and found it really wonderful once I got past the unusual technique.",

            "There are three classic post-apocalyptic books that keep ringing in my thoughts years after I first read them - Pat Frank's Alas! Babylon, George R. Stewart's Earth Abides and Kate Wilhelm's Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang.I read Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang when it was first published in 1976. I was a twenty-six year old housewife and mother with two small children at the time, and the world presented by Ms. Wilhelm was frighteningly prophetic to me. Rachel Carson's book, Silent Spring, was a must read, the cold war was in the news every day and there was a certain sense of doom in the air.So it was not a far-fetched thought that the world could end up much as the author outlined. I found it totally believable at the time, and on re-reading the book, still do. Other reviews have claimed that Ms. Wilhelm's science on cloning is wrong. I say, how do we know - we haven't done it yet, let alone continuously for generations. We don't know what would be created if we took that step. As for the question of what would happen if all the bees died, we may be finding out the answer to that question sooner rather than later.The book looks at society at three different times - at the time of modern's society's collapse, at the society built by the generations of clones, and at the beginning of the end of the clone's society. Each part follows one character, examining the thoughts, deepest emotions and actions of their lives and how it affects their society.I have conflicting emotions every time I read this book - which has been many times over the past forty years or so. I feel sad at the way our world ends, anger at the way the character Molly is treated by her fellow clones after her individualism surfaces, d&eacute;j&agrave; vu in reading about Mark and his fruitless struggle to fit in as a single with a crowd of multiples, and satisfaction at the end.I heartily recommend this book - it should be on every high school reading list. If we look around at the way we are treating the planet, at the experiments in genetic modifications, at the progress we have made in cloning, we may find this book to be more realistic than we would like it to be. But it might also make some of us change how we act. And maybe the sweet birds will continue to sing.Katy B. Allene @ Apocalypsebookreviews.blogspot.com",
            "The novel's somehow simplistic hypothesis that humans cloned en masse will act more like a flock of seagulls than humans is counterbalanced by a beautiful, inspired and bittersweet writing.Kate Wilhelm's dying civilization is remarkably convincing and she succeeds where dozens of other writers have failed: to make a post-apocalyptic society believable and operational.However, if you wanted to take away one thing from this book, it would be its key heroes. Roughly divided into 3 time periods, they are characters you find yourself to care about, they have complex emotions (a rare feat in SF) and unanswered questions. Actually, my only compaint is that as soon as I got accustomed to a hero, Kate Wilhelm took him out of the picture and went on to the next one, much like an anxious waiter taking your plate before you are finished.Worthy Hugo, 4 stars.",
            "A book about a post-apocalypse and cloning... and the rights of an individual, wilderness survival and justifying a means to an end- this wee 200 page book skillfully stacks topics like fragile dinner plates. Each matter is delicate in itself but when reinforced with the other themes and stories, the entire pile is dense and foreboding. Dig in!Story 1: Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang - 5/5 - The vague apocalypse inches towards in time and an affluent family decides to pull some strings to facilitate their survival through the dark times ahead. A rich cave system, a genetic laboratory and a well-supplied hospital are at the tips of their fingers. The problem with cloning clones is a junction which they'll pass when they come to it. The clones being made, the elders must cope with the divergence in the new humanity they have created.Story 2: Shenandoah - 3/5 - An outcaste clone finds her individuality and secretly bares a son who she raises in an abandoned house. Once their secret is revealed, her inclusion into the `breeding' caste is a difficult transition for both mother and son. The colony is probed to a darker degree and must deal with the consequences of its growth.Story 3: At the Still Point - 4/5 - The outcaste son from the Shenandoah story resists efforts to include him in the all aspects of the colony. His rebelliousness is seen as a nuisance but also one of opportunity, as he is able to teach some clones how to live in the wilderness. The closer he becomes to the clones the further away he mentally distances himself from their creed. The world beyond the colony is explored to a limited degree, truths about the destruction are being made clear and the future of the clone colony is seated in uncertainty.",
            "I read this book back when it was first published in the late 1970's and it has gripped my imagination since that time. I am an avid reader of all type of materials and few stay in my mind like this book. I have reread it several times over the years and currently am reading it again. It deals with what could happen after war/disease or some other disaster lays waste to most of the world and its population. The science is well done enough to be believable- but I think the best part of the book is the human interactions between the \"Elders\" and the Clones. I find it a very well written book and would highly recommend it to anyone. If you are hard core science then try to overlook the scientific portion about cloning and just enjoy the ride.",
            "I am no English major or literary critic. I know only that I either like a book or don't. Some books grab me so that I can't bear to put them down. This was one such book.It was not the characters or the technical accuracy of the science that drew me in, but the questions that this book left me with... Questions about our society and the struggle between the individual and the community. About the hubris of man in all his endeavors to control the future and his seeming blindness to his own failures until it is too late. About what is instinctual in us, what is necessary for growth and creativity and adaptability.These are themes (and there are many others not covered in this book) that seem to run through good and great novels from any era. We know them when we read them and they leave us feeling uneasy or thoughtful because we have more questions than answers.Pick apart the individual trees if you must but then you will miss the great forest and the voices that whisper words and call to us all if we would only listen.",
            "Dealing with the sensitive subject of cloning and its effects on an isolated colony of clones, Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang, is a continuous storyline separated into sections with many years in between them. Each segment, so-to-speak, has it's own protagonists and antagonists and crises to deal with and overcome.Even with the skipping of years in-between segments, the story-line stays pretty continuous and the reader is really able to develop a bond with the characters in a way that I wouldn't think possible with each segment introducing new individuals (or are there actually individuals in a cloned society!)Overall, this is a wonderful novel filled with adventure, mystery and tough questions regarding what it really is to be either an individual or part of a community. I would highly recommend, not only to science fiction fans but to anyone who wants to be able to have something to think about while also having an enjoyable reading experience.",
            "I really enjoyed this book. I would have actually enjoyed a bit more details in places, but at the same time, occasional jumps forward in time keep the pace of the book moving. A very interesting take on where cloning could possibly lead and the need for different view points and diversity in life. You feel for the characters who are outcasts. A short read but worth the time.",
            "On one level, Kate Wilhelm's Hugo-winner Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang is a brilliant and insightful musing on one possible set of implications of cloning. On another, it is an environmental/ecological cautionary tale. But at its heart, it is a family saga spanning several generations. I was immediately charmed by this story's warmth and humanity. The first few chapters perfectly set the stage for what is to come, introducing the central family at a time when things are mostly normal, a time before the world began to disintegrate and life took on a thousand forms of adversity and complexity. I liked this family, appreciated their strong loyalties and values. I wanted things to go well for them.But things do not go well, or at least not as planned. Ecological, economic, and environmental turmoil ensues, and the process is wholly believable to a modern reader. Wilhelm was remarkably prescient in her writing, and the book feels neither dated nor far-fetched in its allusions to these societal troubles. She writes as a realist, neither heavy-handed nor preachy. Yet she is unflinching in authenticity, and I was fully convinced that her future is not only plausible, but at least partially probable. This apocalypse makes a bang for the world at large, but in the microcosm of the world of the central family, the effect is more akin to a whisper spreading out through the generations, impossible to ignore, until finally it is the only sound left.Lest I spoil anything essential, I will only circle around the novel's plot beyond what is plainly told on a dust jacket synopsis. Due to the aforementioned worldly catastrophes, fertility is drastically impaired - both for animals and humans. One large, extended family, blessed both with resources and the ingenuity of a number of brilliant and resourceful individuals, devises a long-long-term plan to both allow the family to survive and to provide for the clan in the future. The result is the single most insightful, well-rounded, and horrific exploration of the wider implications of cloning I've ever encountered, (Kazuo Ishiguro's Never Let Me Go included) as well as a true-ringing exploration of one family's struggle in a post-apocalyptic world. Labeling these people \"tenacious\" only scratches the surface of their character. I kept hearing Robert A. Heinlein in my head, chanting a litany: \"Specialization is for insects.\" Indeed, specialization is what initially allows the family to survive, through their polymathic panoply of diversely-skilled members. But over time, an almost insect-like efficiency and homogeneity prevails and affords the family the strengths it needs to thrive. (Of course, as things tend to be cyclic in nature, what goes around comes around again...)The book is organized into sections focusing on successive generations of the family, and each is at once more alien and more familiar than the last. Wilhelm is adept at engendering empathy in the reader, coaxing you to understand the motives and choices the family must employ, even when those paths seem unthinkable or distasteful. Whatever gets to you on a personal level - a young man struggling with unrequited or lost love, a young woman determined to be independent even at the expense of her heart, a father figure making hard decisions for his family, a woman wanting something better for her child, a boy striving to fit in yet be different, a woman afforded no rights, a scientist desperately seeking solutions, an artist seeing the world differently, a youth determined to make his own path in the world...selfish, selfless, self-sacrificing, self-centered - they're all here, and more. In fact, nearly every conceivable facet of \"the self\" can be found in the whole of the entity of \"the family\", filtered through thematic lenses of adaptation vs stagnation, conformity vs self-determination, tradition vs innovation. This is social/anthropological/archetypal science fiction at its absolute best, exploring with unclouded eyes the ability of humanity to endure through adaptation, through re-inventing itself as something new as many times as necessary, to discover, re-discover, and explore territory both new and old, and to finally emerge from its chrysalis reborn, yet perhaps even more fully human than ever.I feel Kate Wilhelm (perhaps better known in some reader circles for her mysteries) has created an absolute classic of speculative literature which is tragically under-exposed. I was enormously enriched by this reading experience, and I know I will revisit this title again and again over the years, now that its seed has been sown in me. I enthusiastically recommend Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang to all fans of intelligent fiction.(Disclosure: I obtained my review copy of this novel through the Goodreads.com First Reads program.)",
            "In the not too distant future, sexual reproduction is compromised by environmental pollution, while at the same time artificial cloning steps in to take its place. Fast forward many generations and we find thriving cloned societies in full bloom. A society based on identical multiples evolves, with such groups of identical beings existing as a new sort of family unit. Such families of identical beings are extremely tightly knit--with an almost telepathic connection to one another. As a result even sex becomes a group activity, with neighboring identical families meeting to conduct orgies. Into this society stumbles the protagonist, a lone and genetically unique individual whose mother had chosen to separate herself from this cloned society--as at this point it seems that environmental pollution has abated to point where sexual reproduction is again possible. He finds the cloned world difficult to connect with--and a sexual relationship with a young woman from this society is undermined by the realization that such a relationship can never be exclusive (or classically romantic) when the young woman continues to indulge in the orgies that are an inseparable part of her world.The Achilles Heel of this cloned society, however, is seen to be the inability of its members to act autonomously, as well as the degenerating influence of genetic drift and a lack of genetic diversity. Not only is it difficult for members of cloned society to venture forth on the sort of routine exploration that would hardly challenge a Boy Scout troupe--each succeeding generation possesses less of the special abilities needed to advance and maintain the technology upon which artificial cloning depends. In the end, as cloned society falters under the accumulated weight of its disadvantages, a new and reinvigorated society of genetically unique and autonomous individuals is seen to surge forward and take its place.",
            "I am working my way through the novels that have won the Hugo or Nebula award since their inception. I've made it through roughly 25 novels and besides Ursula LeGuin's The Left Hand of Darkness, this is my favorite book from both lists by far. It's definitely light on the science fiction aspect, more like a Greg Bear \"lite\" book in terms of technology, but the subject and direction and characters were just beautiful to me. I loved it and I hope it doesn't go totally out of print.",
            "The book has an interesting premise. But it jumps around in time a lot at the beginning without any clear transition, so it's a little tough to follow. There's never any (or very little) description of how old the people are after the time jumps, either. But by far the most annoying thing is the names of the characters. Clones of a particular person all share, for example, \"B\" names. This might be considered \"cute\" in the real world - aww, look, little Johnny and Joseph and Jeremy and Jesse playing together. It makes for very annoying reading, though, and it's never clear who the F is talking. After a while I just gave up and didn't bother to try to understand who was speaking. The \"story\" is interesting enough that you can do that. It could have been written much better, though."

            "- Do houseguests constantly complain that you've got nothing interesting to read in the bathroom?- Do friends complain that waiting impatiently for you (as you try on your 33rd successive outfit while getting ready to go to the club) is boring because your coffee table contains only archaic episodes of the Onion and a few unpaid cable bills* to read?- Are you constantly searching for 'light' or 'light-hearted' reading material that won't suck you in to a plot-line and refuse to let you get to sleep until 5 minutes before your alarm goes off?Then go get yourself a copy of Field Guide to the Apocalypse : Movie Survival Skills for the End of the World by Meghann MarcoMost of the people I choose to spend my Saturday nights gaming, watching movies or even just socializing with, probably could have written this book. I probably could have written this book. You probably could've written this book** -- if we weren't so busy whiling our time away reading and writing things like Amazon.com Reviews instead, that is.But thank heavens that Meghann Marco did - because it needed to be written!! And she definitely did it justice. Don't believe me without thumbing through it yourself? &lt;A href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/068987877X/ref=sib_rdr_ex/104-1816661-9405525?%5Fencoding=UTF8&p;=S00I&j;=0#reader-page\">Go read a few excerpts.&lt;/a>It's a delightful little book - and if you keep it on the coffeetable, or in the W.C., it will amuse the crap out of you*** - presuming you have at least a passing knowledge of post-apocalyptic movies. It's good to be familiar with just about any Charlton Heston after-the-end-of-civilization movie (Planet of the Apes, Soylent Green, Omega Man...) It's good to know any Kubrick 'futurism' movies (2001, Dr. Strangelove...) It's good to know some of the more popular Philip K. Dick stories-adapted-to-movies (Blade Runner, Total Recall, Minority Report...) It doesn't hurt to have a healthy knowledge of the Classic-Sci-Fi-novel-turned-movies (1984, Farenheit 451, Brave New World...) in order to get a lot of the 'Cognoscenti' references. But even if your only familiarity is a brush with Logan's Run or the Matrix movies, you'll still enjoy the humor.Honestly, this isn't deep, meaningful literature. It's not groundbreaking - there are a slew of similar books on the same subjects, including those limited to just one genre of PA society (zombies, comets, asteroids, wastelands...)But it IS damn funny... and it's definitely worth the cover price.Even if nobody else ever stays in your post-apocalypticesque bathroom long enough to find out why &lt;u>you&lt;/u> kept laughing so hard while you were in there!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------* Which at least explains why they aren't watching pay-per-view adult movies on your TV instead** An assumption, given that you're literate enough to have gotten this far and clearly have at least a passing interest in the subject matter - or you wouldn't have kept reading*** The pun was unintentional when I wrote it, but then it amused me, so I left it in due to vanity (did you catch that one?) and because I can (can! hah... another bad restroom pun! I crack me up - not as much as the book does, but you get what you pay for)",
            "It's always inspiring when someone you know gets her very own ISBN, especially if it's for a book that's funny, even moreso if it's intentionally funny. After watching scads of end-of-the-world flicks, Meghann Marco (of MeghannMarco.com, wtf) has written the book that is bound to continue to inspire even after our planet's doomsday -- I predict it will inspire fights to the death among the coming apocalypse's more intelligent would-be survivors (i.e., those outside of Tim LaHaye's readership).Though it's inspired by films, Meghann's book is packed surprisingly full with Actual Information, some of which doesn't even have to wait for the Apocalypse in order to be true. For example, though she's talking about survival in Arctic conditions, \"a lot of work means a lot of death\" is undeniable by anyone who's ever done much of it. At least one tip has clearly been studied by the U.S. military:\"If you don't understand what the informant is saying, keep kneeing him in the stomach until he says, `Okay, okay, okay' and speaks English. Everybody speaks English if you knee them in the stomach enough.\"",
            "Actually, the hysteria was just me reacting to some unbelievably true little factoids I learned about our impending doom. I couldn't stop laughing-though at one point it turned to a nervous laugh due to the fact that the apocalypse is pretty much on its way and if we don't wake up, gear up, and put on our alien-seeing 80s sunglasses, then we're all screwed. The apocalypse is a scary subject, but it's a nice to know that if we should happen to come under an invasion from weird, green, anti-water alien people, we can always send Boy George to try to work things out. We'll probably be zapped to hell but at least we can go out with a smile. Good call Ms. Marco. Keep the good stuff coming.",
            "By Phil VillarrealArizona Daily StarIf the movies have taught us anything, it's that the apocalypse will most definitely arrive. When it does, we're going to need a 1970s muscle car to get through all the explosions and mad dashes against warlords.When the day is nigh, it will also help to acquire a canine sidekick and a cache of weapons.\"Field Guide to the Apocalypse: Movie Survival Skills for the End of the World\" ($10.36), by former video-store manager Meghann Marco, pragmatically guides you through the ins and outs of identifying and surviving false utopias, alien invasions and weather cataclysms.Under the guise of a how-to book, \"Field Guide\" emerges as rapacious satire that takes the whole of action and sci-fi film history and shapes it into an oddly constructed world with its own arbitrary rules and regulations, to be joyfully torn apart by Marco's snappy, fluid prose. A must-read for any film fanatic, the guide plunders contradictions and clich&eacute;s, taking preposterous movie science at its own level and holding it up for ridicule.A vein of hilarious nostalgia courses through the pages, as we learn how not to be replaced by a robot in the vein of \"Blade Runner,\" as well as how to identify if our food is people (\"Soylent Green\"). The gamut of popcorn movies is covered and comedically splintered, ranging from \"Metropolis\" (1927) to \"Signs\" (2002) and slapdown of the midlife crises by George Lucas and Steven Spielberg that caused them to re-edit their classics.With wit, intense observation, occasional flashes of raw anger and reserves of accessible film knowledge, Marco makes her points with a flourish in a page-turner that demands to be read in one sitting.- Contact reporter Phil Villarreal at 520-573-4130 or prv@azstarnet.com",
            "Ahhh, Meghann Marco, it must be crazy being around you. So the end of the world is coming (and it will come) so what are you going to do? Well, Meghann has given us some options based on knowledge-stealing from friends like 'Smart Neighbor', her own research, and piles of Apocalyptic movie scenarios. While this book isn't dead serious, it still provides some actual information yet in a highly humorous way. What do we have to look forward to - here ya go:1. The False Utopia where culture, emotions, and reproduction are controlled by the 'higher ups'. How to break free of those mind controlling drugs they have you on and how to hide your freewill so as not to be captured and 'recycled'. You learn how to tell if you're in a dreamworld and how to avoid the simulacrum robot replacement initiatives.Some at the movie references: The Island, Matrix, Clockwork Orange, Total Recall, Equilibrium, Stepdford Wives.2. Neo-Medieval World and how it's brought about through natural disasters (super volcanos, greenhouse effect, ice age, meteor strike), pandemic disease, robot revolution, and the massive co-ordinated animal uprising. You learn how to survive in the apocalyptic wasteland (remember Wardrobe, Firepower, and proper choosing of your Vehicle & Pet). How to become the Warlord. Converting your car to use alternate fuels. Some notes on zombies and how to make antiserums (along with who to save - hotness is a factor). And dealing with massive severe climate change.Look to movies like Mad Max, Army of Darkness, 12 Monkeys, Planet of the Apes, Terminator, Back to the Future, 28 Days Later.3. Advanced Technological Dystopia where computers and robots infest our world. What to do to become the heroic detective and how to talk in 'cityspeak'. Being the Hacker and how to dress for it. How to tell if someone is a replicant and clone (and using it to your advantage). Dealing with extra-terrestrials and robot uprisings.Movies: Terminator, A.I., Blade Runner, Fifth Element, Mars Attacks, They Live, and Alien.4. Lastly, Tips for saving the world such as how to stop the alien invasion, assembling the proper ecclectic group of people to save the world, beating the massive co-ordinated animal uprising, and dealing with giant insects and other mutants of radiation.Meghann gives us a great book to show how we can outwit and survive those less knowledgeable people that live down the street. Big influences on Mad Max movies, Matrix, & Blade Runner. Also, Meghann wants to make sure that anyone should be saving Jude Law for her (or George Clooney as a back up). She appreciates the undefined wisdom of Biff Tannen and most importantly... do whatever you need to to get a 1974 Ford Falcon 'V8 Interceptor' and you will be sure to survive.",
            "If, by some chance, I should ever survive an apocalypse, I definately want this book on hand. It is useful, insightful, and, oh yeah, hilarious. Having seen the movies she references makes it all the more fun. Read it for yourself, and pass it on to friends. You'll be quoting from it in no time.",
            "Freaking awesome book. Just finished reading it, and there's alot of good stuff in there. Good overeveiw on pretty any bad end of the world scenerio. Exept global warming, but lets worry about that later. Lots of movie referances (face it, that's where we really learn stuff) and great mood. There's even a section in there about how to jerrymander your car to be baddass. I found the \"Neo Medival \" section to be most useful, and could apply to a wide range of very possible disasters, from that terrible movie \"Waterworld\" to the desert wasteland that always comes with the end of a nuclear war.Also, the cover is bumpy wherever there are bulletholes. Feel the bumps, buy the book!",
            "I just finished reading \"Field Guide to the Apocalypse\" and it was as enjoyable a read as I have had in a while. Meghann has a wit and wisdom that exceeds what most people seem to have in their tiny little brains...plus she is cute as HELL! I had the pleasure of meeting her at a little get together at the Brooklyn Brewery on Sat. Aug. 27 and hearing her read from the book. It presents both fact and fiction, and Meghann's sense of humor makes the read that much more enjoyable. Some of the information within really made me think about how we've F@#$%! UP this world of ours. My favorite chapter dealt with \"those damn dirty apes\" from that planet visited by Charleton Heston. Although the author does an excellent job with the jocularity, some factoids made me a little nervous, but a little more aware of what we can do to save this little rock we call earth. Nice job Meghann. I can't wait for your next tome.",
            "This may have been the funniest book I ever have read. It was informative, humorous, and entertaining. I think any fan of scifi movies would love this; there were so many hidden pop culture references throughout, it was almost like a game trying to figure out what each movie reference was while rereading it (and you'll definitely want to reread it).On top of which, she mentioned Blade Runner, my favorite movie :) .",
            "Its fun, funny, and actually informative. I loved everything from the advice on making new leathers look worn, down to the how to make your own bio-diesel.",

            "Funny as hell, no funnier than that; funny as underwater basket weaving.",
            "This is one of those books.Unfortunately shorter than War and Peace or Brothers Kam... , something Cyrillic. We need more from this author. She is someone who has the wit to spit in the eye of the inevitable. You wouldn't mind striking up a conversation with her in the line at the DMV or waiting for that express elevator. If you guys have any pull, use it for our advantage. Please. This is a funny, insightful, useful book.",
            "My girlfriend bought me this and I read it over breakfast. It made me laugh so hard I splurted milk out through my nose and it ruined my CoCo Puffs. So I got another bowl, and laughed even harder and splurted more laugh milk everywhere. Meghann Marco is a hella funny comedian. And girls aren't funny so that's saying something. Her book is set up like a survival guide but it's really a subtle satire of dumb action movies. The girl has seen way too many movies but at least she has a good sense of humor about it. She tells how to determine if you're an alien, how to kick @ like Mad Max and the best part is how she exposes the Signs guy Shamlamadingdong and Spielberg for the stoopid frauds they are. A book has never made me laugh so hard and now I'm going to leave my girlfriend to live with it.",

To this I would add stylistic comparisons with the works of Aldous Huxley [Brave_New_World], Poul Anderson [The_Day_After_Doomsday], and Mary Shelley [Frankenstein]."

        "description": "Terrorist attacks. Natural disasters. Domestic crackdowns. Economic collapse. Riots. Wars. Disease. Starvation. What can you do when it all hits the fan? You can learn to be self-sufficient and survive without the system. **I've started to look at the world through apocalypse eyes.** So begins Neil Strauss's harrowing new book: his first full-length worksince the international bestseller The Game, and one of the most original-and provocative-narratives of the year. After the last few years of violence and terror, of ethnic and religious hatred, of tsunamis and hurricanes\u2013and now of world financial meltdown\u2013Strauss, like most of his generation, came to the sobering realization that, even in America, anything can happen. But rather than watch helplessly, he decided to do something about it. And so he spent three years traveling through a country that's lost its sense of safety, equipping himself with the tools necessary to save himself and his loved ones from an uncertain future. With the same quick wit and eye for cultural trends that marked The Game, The Dirt, and How to Make Love Like a Porn Star, Emergency traces Neil's white-knuckled journey through today's heart of darkness, as he sets out to move his life offshore, test his skills in the wild, and remake himself as a gun-toting, plane-flying, government-defying survivor. It's a tale of paranoid fantasies and crippling doubts, of shady lawyers and dangerous cult leaders, of billionaire gun nuts and survivalist superheroes, of weirdos, heroes, and ordinary citizens going off the grid. It's one man's story of a dangerous world\u2013and how to stay alive in it. Before the next disaster strikes, you're going to want to read this book. And you'll want to do everything it suggests. Because tomorrow doesn't come with a guarantee...",

            "I'm planning on applying to medical school so I am reading a lot of hospital-related books these days.I thought this book was a good read. It is definitely a page-turner. Part of the reason for this is that each entry or story is only a page or two in length with only one or two stories going on for more than a few pages. I was able to finish the book in a day.The first story grabs your attention right away as it is very sad. From then on, you read about more sad stories but some downright hilarious ones too. It takes a lot to make me laugh and I couldn't help but chuckle after reading some of these stories.There are two things that I liked about this book. I liked how most of the stories described procedures and gave you a general idea of how doctors treat patients with certain symptoms. Also, at the end of the book, there is a glossary that lists some medical terms that are worth knowing.I gave the book four stars because I felt that most of the stories were too short for them to \"stick\" with you. If they had been a little bit longer with more detail, I think you would remember them. There are a total of 98 stories here and only a few really stuck with me. Overall it is an easy read.I want to warn you that this book is \"R\" rated with regards to language and some scenarios. I wouldn't want a kid reading this book. All the curse words are in here and certain adult themes and situations. It's all professional but I don't think the younger crowd needs to read about it.Summary:It's a quick easy read and it was a fun read as well.",

I have told many of these stories to family and at parties. I have given many copies of the book as presents. It makes a great gift to those that enjoy the stories. ENJOY",
            "This book gives a good view from the MD's perspective. It is both funny, and at times, very reflective. If you are in the field or love the show ER, this is a book that you can very easily associate with. The stories are all captivating in its descriptive manner, you won't be able to put it down. If your stomach gets a little 'queezy' from the site of blood, maybe this book isn't for you. If you know what it's like to work, both in-hospital and pre-hospital fields, this book is for you. I loved it and so will you",
            "This is a bit different than I expected, as each &#34;story&#34; ranges from just a few paragraphs to a number of pages. I really enjoyed it however, and anyone who likes a glimpse into the world of emergency medicine will enjoy it too. Only downside is the lack of availability of a Kindle download.",
            "I am running the gamut of emotions reading this compilation. From the sacred to the profane, ER staff see it all. It is touching, scary, sad, and very very funny at moments. Nothing like life and death to wake you up. A great mix of crazy and varied stories from all over the country.",
            "This was interesting and heartbreaking. Reading it really gave me a good perspective of emergency workers and the types of things they see and go through.Do you believe you can bring things to yourself by meditating on them? I ended up in the ER 2 days after finishing this book, but got out okay (though loopy on pain meds). Now I'm looking to read a non-fiction book written by a lotto winner who is living in Fiji... If you know of a book like this, let me know.",
            "A large collection of mostly short but emotionally powerful accounts of happenings in the ER. I had to read this book lying on my back at times to keep the tears from messing up my reading glasses.",
            "A very funny commentary on the state of the human animal asseen in crisis settings. Entertaining and enlightening readingfor the adult. Not for the meek or timid. This is real life andnot a TV show!",
            "I have to say this book was wonderful! It would be great for anyone who is glued to the TV on Thursday nights. As I read the stories, I actually imagined the story taking place at Cook County General with Mark,Carol,Carter,Elizabeth,Kerry and the rest of the crew. It is also great for anyone who has no clue as to what I am referring to. After reading it, I bought a second copy for my cousin who is an RN. I highly reccommend this book!",
            "Emergency Room doctors and nurses share stories that absolutely shocked me in this book. Many of the stories seem too bizarre to be true, but then again truth often is stranger than fiction! These docs and nurses are surprisingly compassionate with people who have committed all sorts of indecent, sometimes ridiculous, often vulgar acts to themselves or others. This is a very original compilation of some of the best and worst case histories in the field of emergency medicine. Caution: Reading before bedtime may give one nightmares! Great Book!",
            "This book concisely describes the joy and sorrow of all Er personnel worldwide. More importantly ir reveals the true nature of Emergency Medicine / Nursing in the raw form and allows all of us Er personnel to reflect on our current practices. Sometimes, we are too caught up in the biomedical nature of emergency medicine that we forget our clients as persons. Er persionnel are humans too who have dedicated themselves to provide quality emergency care. This book also aptly describes the true context of our feelings, the problems we face daily in the Er. I find this book a source of inspiration for myself as i was feeling burnet out and it allowed me to get my perspectives back in the right place. I had to laugh, cry and cringe with all the stories which were related in this book. No other book has allowed me the joy of doing so. The best book i have read in a long, long, long time. I recommend this book for all involved in the Er and hope that ALL health care instuitions and Er personnel obtain a copy of this marvellous book.",
            "This book had me alternating between laughter and tears as I progressed through the stories... I just checked for other Mark Brown books, and was disappointed that I can't find more of Mark's compilations. This was one of the most entertaining, touching books that I have read in awhile.",
            "I enjoyed the book Emergency: True Stories From The Nations ER, since the stories were all based on actual events. There are some that will make you laugh till you cry and there is some that are real heartbreaking.But I rate this book five stars, and would recomend anyone to read it.",
            "This is one of a growing genre of \"true life\" hospital stories. Like fictional TV shows, these accounts tend to give a skewed view of what life in the ER is really like. This book is no exception and tends towards tales that shock, amaze and appall. The reader becomes a voyeur into the lives of medical and nursing staff of the department and sees the best and worst, though primarily the worst, that the job brings. Yes, this book has a frission of excitement and transports you to the centre of the scene, and there are some truly humorous segments, but overall I found that the balance was tipped to the depressing angle of destruction that people wreak on the lives of themselves and others. That said, and taking into account this caveat, I expect that most fans will find plenty of stories to entertain them and rather than being put off, will be drawn further into the ghoulish detail.",
            "Not in great condition, but then, I didn't pay a lot for it either. Arrived promptly. Thank you.",
            "Just like the tv show, some things it is best not to know.",
            "Parents Beware---Although this book was a blast to read, it isfor ADULTS ONLY!!! The content in this book constantly discusses casesof sexuality using words related to reproduction such as sex and oral sex and to the reproductive organs such as penis and vagina. It is my firm belief that the author was wrong in entering this kind of languange into this piece of literature.Thank you. END",
            "This little orange book has a lot to recommend it: The stories are powerful, sometimes for the hope they give, sometimes for the horror they reveal, sometimes for both. The writing is clear and easy to read, and goes by quickly. Perhaps most impressively, the pace and rhythm are such that in spite of the peaks of emotion achieved, burnout is avoided, with humor and hope slipping in to defuse the horror just when as it becomes too great to contain, and horror making its appearance just when we are so uplifted that we should burst. These are the best of the stories collected from over 15,000 ER staff members, so if you want to know the extremes of life at your local Emergency Room, don't bother with TV's ER, read this book instead.",
            "EMERGENCY! is nonfiction that reads like a page-turner novel. This book contains over 100 vignettes written by emergency room doctors and nurses all over the country. Some are dark and sad, some are hopeful and uplifting, most are gruesome, and all are so compelling that you can't help but go on to the next. I don't think I have a particular penchant for morbidity, but I read this book in one afternoon.There are stories of GOMERs (Get Out of My Emergency Room), elderly people barely hanging on to life who must be resusitated; patients with DSB (Drug-Seeking Behavior), who come in with an imagined complaint in hopes of getting narcotics; SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) babies; mothers having babies in cars; severed body parts; Code Blues; people with, er, complaints of a personal nature.We meet a young man who needs a blood transfusion thanks to a stab wound, but won't get one because he carries a card in his wallet that states he's a Jehovah's Witness. Gastroenterologists try out their new toy; interns try to intubate patients; lab techs faint in patients' laps; everyone works long hours.EMERGENCY! brings us straight into the ER, where we know the stress of trying to keep patients alive, and the anguish of family, friends, and staff left behind when it can't be done. You will cry, you will laugh, you will wonder why you are reading this book--but once you've started it, read it you will.Kimberly Borrowdale, Under the Covers Book Reviews",
            "I love a book that brings home the drama of daily life in a way that makes you laugh and makes you cry. This book of short stories from the nations's emergency rooms covers everything from everyday mishaps to monumental tragedies; from the guy next door, to human monsters. Perhaps before the advent of the TV show, it may have seemed a bit graphic. But now that we all know how to perform our own kidney transplants, these anecdotes seem fairly tame. Some readers may not appreciate the author's familiarity with various bodily orifices and the unusual things that some people have used them for, so the book may not be OK for kids. My own kids who are in their early teens, and undisturbed by the fact that there's more to us than our fingers and toes, really enjoyed the book and were quite moved by some of the stories. So were many friends. A perfect &quot;people-read.&quot; A great gift.",
            "I love stories from the ER, and this book is perfect. It has a wonderful variety of stories that range from hilarious to sad, and the length of each story also varies nicely. Some stories are only half a page long. Others are nearly 10 pages. It's a nice book to take with you when you want a nice collection of tales to read in a short amount of time.Highly recommended!",
            "I bought this book origanally because my husband works as a charge nurse in the ER with Dr Mark Brown (the Author) I wanted to see what all the hype was about. I was not dissapointed! The moment I started reading I never put it down.There were so many stories. I couldnt help myself, I read it from beggining to end without stopping! I myself, am in nursing school, after reading this book I have decided the ER is where I need to be. I found myself laughing out loud, tearing up and praying for a good ending... sometimes all in the same story. I recommend this book to anyone interestead in the true stories of the ER, and anyone wanting to know more about the differnt world in which Doctors, Nurses and Techs subject themselves to daily. Keep a box of Kleenex nearby for both happy and unhappy tears. I can't wait for Vol 2!!!",
            "Mark Brown has collected ER stories from folks around the country. During my first ER clinical I pulled the legs apart on a woman with a broken hip so that a catheter might be inserted, I listened to the ER head med complain that it was Saturday morning and you did not start the day with an MI, I listened to the PA joke about a patient with \"fibro-myassia\", and I watched the chief doc stonewall a patient because the patient seemed to think that his (the patient's) pain was all that mattered. No one ever died from pain, he said. Okay, think about it.Mark Brown would not have used one of my stories in his book. What he writes about is more outstanding. ER is the sadly tragic interspersed with the joyful or lovely. A vagabond who insists that she once attended Julliard returns with her violin and plays four hours of glorious music without repeting a note. On another night in another town, ER gets to deal with an unconscious male who had been playing sex games with his bound wife. When the husband knocked himself out, all the bound wife could do is hollar until the firemen broke in.I can hear Captain Picard from Star Trek issuing the command to \"Make it so.\" Gosh, I wish that the ER was the place to make it so. Sometimes it is. Sometimes it isn't. Sometimes it's the ER staff that survives.",
            "Excellent collection of short stories. Every one is so unique in it's presentation. Some will make you cry, smile, groan, and even make you angry. Couldn't put it down. You wil read this one over and over.",
            "- Most of the stories are only one page long.- A few of the stories are funny.- Overall, they're too short to stir up emotion.- In short, it's worth reading once.",
            "I've had this book for quite some time & have re-read it more than once. Each time I'm struck by how true to life most of the stories are & how many I've experienced in the time I've worked at my hospital ER. The only trouble? Some of these stories are known urban legends.This book collects several stories, some of which are sad, some infuriating, some hilarious. One of the stories that always seems to stick with me is the one about the insane violinist. It's a truly sad story, that one. Luckily there's just as many hilarious stories to even the book out.The only spot that marred this book was that there were a few urban legends thrown into the mix, such as the \"Superman\" sex fiasco. While I am willing to believe that there's people out there who might have gotten into a jam, the story given is pretty much identical to the one floating around on the internet. The story is still funny, it is painfully obvious that the person copied it off of the internet & it makes the many of the obviously real stories seem somewhat false by comparison. This isn't the only one in the book- there are several interspersed throughout the volume, some of which are ones that I've heard time & time again via various sources. How am I sure that these people didn't witness these? Because they submitted stories that have gone through several incarnations over the years, with the ones in the book being the \"latest\" versions. It just makes me wonder what type of screening & fact checking was done when this book was put together. Again, I just found that it made the true stories feel cheaper & faker just by being listed by those that were obviously listed so the submitter could see their name in print.Other than that, this book is definitely worth the time to read. It makes for a wonderful \"bathroom\" or quick read book for those times when you can't sit & have a lengthy read. (Although if you do have the time, it's fine as a continuous read as well.)",
            "&quot;Emergency&quot; is an easy-to-read book that gives you a fabulous insight of the world of trauma. The stories are uncensored and includes ALL the crazy stories one would face in the ER. You will definitely have a differnet outlook on life after reading this book. Recommended for ages 14 and older. Happy Reading :)"

        "description": "Terrorist attacks. Natural disasters. Domestic crackdowns. Economic collapse. Riots. Wars. Disease. Starvation. What can you do when it all hits the fan? You can learn to be self-sufficient and survive without the system. **I've started to look at the world through apocalypse eyes.** So begins Neil Strauss's harrowing new book: his first full-length worksince the international bestseller The Game, and one of the most original-and provocative-narratives of the year. After the last few years of violence and terror, of ethnic and religious hatred, of tsunamis and hurricanes\u2013and now of world financial meltdown\u2013Strauss, like most of his generation, came to the sobering realization that, even in America, anything can happen. But rather than watch helplessly, he decided to do something about it. And so he spent three years traveling through a country that's lost its sense of safety, equipping himself with the tools necessary to save himself and his loved ones from an uncertain future. With the same quick wit and eye for cultural trends that marked The Game, The Dirt, and How to Make Love Like a Porn Star, Emergency traces Neil's white-knuckled journey through today's heart of darkness, as he sets out to move his life offshore, test his skills in the wild, and remake himself as a gun-toting, plane-flying, government-defying survivor. It's a tale of paranoid fantasies and crippling doubts, of shady lawyers and dangerous cult leaders, of billionaire gun nuts and survivalist superheroes, of weirdos, heroes, and ordinary citizens going off the grid. It's one man's story of a dangerous world\u2013and how to stay alive in it. Before the next disaster strikes, you're going to want to read this book. And you'll want to do everything it suggests. Because tomorrow doesn't come with a guarantee...",
