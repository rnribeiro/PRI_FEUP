            "This book is an interesting combination of pacifist-Quaker tract, coming of age novel, and post-holocaust science fiction. The story is set in a near future after a nuclear holocaust-nuclear winter. There are small colonies of survivors in communities maintained by enigmatic aliens, whom some survivors suspect of triggering the holocaust. The main character is a young woman coming to maturity in a community of survivors in Pennsylvania, a community where many survivors are Quakers. The point of the story is the necessity of pacifism and Quaker respect for life beliefs. The characterization is convincing and the author's depiction of this future is equally convincing. The quality of writing is very good.",
            "The Wall around Eden is a cautionary tale that illustrates consequences of human tendancies to solve problems through violence. Joan Slonczewski spins the tale at leisurely pace and develops the cast of characters to teach lessons of utmost importance that face human survival. As a lover of Science Fiction, this is a worthy gem to appreciate.As a resident of Pennsylvania, this novel helps me appreciate the world view of the Quakers and the rationale of their practices. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is curious about the Quakers. Congratulations Joan on this masterpiece!",

            "is there hope? The Earth is recovering from a atomic war that was carried out twenty years earlier. And right after the missiles exploded the aliens came and protected some of the towns and cities with the Walls. The Walls kept the people in, while they watched the rest of the world die. The Walls kept them in but allowed the radiation in.But some babies lived and some animals and plants survived (inside the Wall). Now humans must try to keep living, planning for a future, a future for their children and mankind.To have a future, they must understand their past and also come to understand the aliens. Did they start the war? Why did they come and build the Walls? What plans do they hace for mankind or are they just collecting what is left of mankind for a zoo?A must for any sci-fi library.",
            "This story was well enough written, but it lacked some pizzazz or something.It told the story of a community after the nuclear holocaust, people are protected by some advanced species. The proctectors can only communicate in pictures and, therfore, not very complex ideas.The story revolves around a young girl, coming of age, who is rebellious, but can not really find anything to rebel against. The people are well enough off and have freedom within the confines of their community, but they cannot go beyond a certain distant away.The be all to end all is that she gets to know their captors better and grows to see them as protectors. I think there is an allogory to pregnancy and birth in here also, but I did not look or think too hard about it. It is a pretty good story."

The story centers around a family who returns to France after one generation's absence and must come to terms with themselves and each other. This book was written during the last part of the war and the sadness of the reality of the war is evident in the book. Don't let the slow beginning fool you, the rest of the book is worth your effort.",
            "I love this book. I read it many years ago...The beginning starts off peacefully, like a romance, you become part of the scenerios, you fall in love with the characters...Then all of a sudden there is war (World War 1)...This novel is about people in that epoch, about tango dancing, about France and Argentina. About money and the pampas...About Germany...In fact about all of Europe...It is about an epoch in which people thought the world would end in war and genocide and everyone was just trying to have sex and fall in love and live life to the fullest before it all came to an end...The name Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse which is a phrase taken from the last book in the Bible which talks about Armageddon (better known as \"the end of the world.\" This book is like a mix of War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy and Gone With The Wind by Margaret Mitchell, only better. The English translation of this book is so true to the original...nothing, absolutely nothing, is lost in translation here....Read this book if you want to read great literature.",
            "I was spurred to read this book because the 1921 film adaptation is so great; usually I read the book before seeing the movie based on it, if I see the movie based on a book at all. The book is even better than the already phenomenal film; since the film is only about two hours long, it obviously couldn't fit in everything that happens in the book, and there were some things invented, left out, or cut and pasted together (in a respectful tasteful way though). The book gives an even more complete and complex picture of the Desnoyers family and their circle of friends, like having a lot more details about their life in Argentina before Julio, the main character, his sister Chichi, and their cousins the von Hartrotts were born, as well as having more details about their life back in Europe when they returned there shortly before WWI broke out. Having the powerful images from the film in my head made the characters, plotline, and descriptions in the book even more powerful. There were also some things that the book made clearer than the film had, although personally I felt that the ending line of the book wasn't as powerful or effective as the final intertitles of the movie. Still, it's a great book, powerful historical fiction about WWI and the years leading up to it. My only gripe is that this translation is a bit dated, such as in certain words or turns of phrase that now have different connotations or have fallen into such disusage that the modern reader would have to look them up. It doesn't change the powerful content one iota, but it would still be nice to have an updated translation with more modern language and some explanatory footnotes where needed."

Traveler is just a an old army ranger and he is going thru the country just trying to survive. He has a problem being around other people as he was hit with a nerve gas that has hightened his every sense. Yet he finds himself being the good guy in many different adventures.It touched me so much that it took me 10 years to find and buy all 13 books but I did it. I am going to try and see if I can get it reprinted for a new generation.If I was stuck on a desert island and could only bring one book, it would be this book or the bible. That is how good it is.",
            "SPOILERS AHEAD!This book was my first post apocalypse science fiction experience. It may seem dated now due to the end of the cold war, but it's definitely worth a look.Our protagonist, Traveler, a former special operations soldier (possibly Delta Force from the vague description of his past) travels the post nuke wasteland in search of fuel, food, weapons, and ammunition. He runs into a small fortified town that has two competitive groups vying for control. He basically plays them both and liberates the town. Antagonists include ; Franklin Milland, former executive or Mafia Don, Captain Zeke Aikers of the Washington National Guard, insane andcannibalistic scavengers called Roadrats, and surprise Guests the Glory Boys, aka the remnants of the U.S. military with oneparticular officer a blast from Travelers past.

            "Maybe I'm addicted to violence. I don't know; all I know is that I love the action contained in this whole series. It really is just one long story here. Lengthwise, it's just right...the type of book that has you turning pages yet doesn't break your stomach if you like to read lying down.Some descriptions are so good, I wouldn't recommend it to those faint of heart. Sometimes you think everything is just like the first book...and it is in a way, but that only demonstrates the way of war. A whole lot of waiting and anxiety for two minutes chaos and death, very little glory for either side.",
            "Picking up minutes after the last book in the series (THUNDER FROM JERUSALEM) ended, Israel is still at war. The Jewish quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem is fighting for it's very life, cut off from the rest of the world. They are rationing food and water, but only fairing a little better then the New City, also under siege. While the defenders try to hold out, their commander struggles to get back to the quarter from the Arab controlled area. And others try to break the Arab blockade keeping the entire city from getting fresh supplies.The more of the Thoenes' books you have read, the more you will enjoy this one. Many of the characters have appeared in previous series, specifically the Zion Chronicles and Zion Covenant series. I also found rereading the end of the last book helpful since this one starts immediately after. Of course, reading the Thoenes' novels is a pleasure because of their skill as storytellers.I enjoyed this book more than the previous two in the series because the action takes place in many different settings. It moves quickly, and the authors do a great job of balancing the large cast of characters. The characters are also well developed, especially considering the book is set during a war. As always, the history presented is accurate as well.This book is a must for any fans of the Thoenes' previous work and people interested in the time period presented. I highly recommend this novel.",
            "The Thoenes are quite a team. The amount of research and detail that Brock's research brings to Bodie's talented writing is amazing. The combination is enthralling for history and fiction buffs. This book, like the others in the series, races from start to finish with tight plotting and razor-thin scenes. If anything, it can be overwhelming at times. Don't try to stretch this book out over a few weeks; you'll have difficulty keeping things straight. This story is meant to be swallowed and digested quickly.Which is not to say that it's a fast-food diet. Bodie Thoene delivers rich metaphors here. From the Khamseen winds at the opening, to the Hurva at the heart of Jerusalem, this story strikes deep into the struggle for Israeli independence and the personal struggle for salvation through the Messiah. Without preaching, the Thoenes tell of powerful grace and love in the midst of horrific bloodshed. The message of valor and courage rings true in light of the terrors the Jews endured.If you're a fan of the series, this book is a must. It'll go down quick and easy, and still leave you satisfied with the sustenance of good writing. (As a side-note, don't turn to the maps for help in deciphering the story...some of the major settings aren't even listed, such as Latrun.) With the secrets still waiting to be revealed at the end of this story, I'm anxious to plunge into the next, &quot;The Jerusalem Scrolls.&quot;",
            "Once upon a time, Bodie Thoene was my favorite fiction writer. After the publication of Shiloh Autumn, however, I found her subsequent books to be a bit dry and uninspiring. Even the first two books in this series, though good, lacked the passion and eloquence of the earlier Thoene writings. In Jerusalem's Heart, though, it would seem that the Thoenes of the Zion Chronicles, Zion Covenant, and Shiloh Autumn are back with us. This new book captures all the action, drama, spiritual depth, and character development of the authors' earlier novels. A wonderfully written and powerfully moving story, Jerusalem's Heart is a good read for anyone interested in middle east politics, good fiction, or vintage Thoene writing.",
            "I finished this book the same day the film \"Uprising\" premiered, and the similarities are striking. Once again, the Jews are outgunned, outmanned, and hungry. And once again, the Thoenes do honor to Jewish heritage and record little known stories--like that of the Jewish struggle in Warsaw--for a legacy of bravery.In this, book #3 of the series, the Jewish defenders try to hold the Old City, while the Jewish army tries desperately to give aid. It's classic Thoene, great action and passion, great writing, great material.The journey is everything. That's the shout from Warsaw, and that's the shout from this book. What stays with me are the words of a woman under siege in Jerusalem...\"Life is the hardest thing...that's where real courage is. Not in dying bravely, but in living bravely.\"",
            "Another thrilling installment of the Zion Legacy series. The Thoene's have a gift for putting their readers in the middle of their novels' fast paced action, and Jerusalem's Heart is no exception. Everything- from the characters to the dialogue to the non-stop suspense is carefully crafted and well executed. Whether read as part of the series or as a stand alone book,Heart is not to be missed.",
            "I love these series! I think they are even better than the \"Left Behind\" series, and I could not put those down! Again, the Thoenes do an excellent and captivating job of telling a great story and the history of the Israeal's beginnings at the same time. The characters' losses are your losses and their happiness is your happiness.For those of you who have read the other series though, the beginning of \"Prague Counterpoint\" involves events and characters in this series during this same time frame at a crucial moment. However, the event in question is not mentioned in this book (involving Jacov and Rabbi Leibovitz), and I am wondering if anyone else noticed that. The events in \"Jerusalem's Heart\" makes one wonder how the characters could accomplish the event in the prologue of the former book, unless the reader is to assume it was possible.Also, Jacob and Lori had no family members left in this series, but they both had younger brothers that escaped with Lori to England before WWII in \"Warsaw Requiem\". Do we ever find out what happened to them?Email me back if you also noticed it!",
            "I love the Thoenes, but I did not really like this series. While descriptive and interesting, the pace of the books are so slow (in time, not action--i.e, one book only takes place over only one or two days) that I did not make it all the way through the books. They are meant to be slow, but personally, I like to keep things moving. I would recommend Zion Covenant, Zion Chronicles, A.D. Chronicles, or, my favorites, the Galway Chronicles and the Shiloh Legacay over this series, especially if you are a first time reader of their usually wonderful work. (By the way, something I really like is that her series often overlap with characters. If you want to get to know all the characters, the order kind of goes like this: Zion Covenant and the Shiloh Legacy, then the Zion Chronicles, and then this series.)",
            "I love anything written by this author Keeps you turning the pages to see what's going to happen. Love the different series by this author also. You are missing out on a lot if you don' t read books by either of the writers in the Thoene family! Outstanding writers. You also learn a bit of history on the way with stories wound among the history. All of their books are great!",
            "This is a discouraging product to deal with. Apparently the publisher has labeled the \"abridged\" product with the wrong ISBN (cassette tape version). I wanted an unabridged edition, but when I ordered with the number listed, I received the abridged version. What is the publisher going to do about it? Or what is Amazon going to do about it? I now have three copies of Jerusalem's heart--all abridged. I can't really give a review of the story because there is too much left out in the abridged version. I like the Thoene's writing, BUT can't comment further.",
            "I liked how the characters are realistic and interesting. I find this period of history particularly interesting. Thoene did a great job weaving history in with the story. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series."

        "description": "Apocalyptic expectations of Armageddon and a New Age have been a fixture of the American cultural landscape for centuries. With the approach of the year 2000, such millennial visions seem once again to be increasing in popularity. Stephen O'Leary sheds new light on the age-old phenomenon of the End of the Age by proposing a rhetorical explanation for the appeal of millennialism. Using examples of apocalyptic argument from ancient to modern times, O'Leary identifies the recurring patterns in apocalyptic texts and movements and shows how and why the Christian Apocalypse has been used to support a variety of political stances and programs. The book concludes with a critical review of the recent appearances of doomsday scenarios in our politics and culture, and a meditation on the significance of the Apocalypse in the nuclear age. Arguing the Apocalypse is the most thorough examination of its subject to date: a study of a neglected chapter of our religious and cultural history, a guide to the politics of Armageddon, and a map of millennial consciousness.",

            "This book is one of the best novels I have ever read. The WAR IN 2020 is an honest book which does not try to pull its punches.Despite some of the themes being dated (written in 1990; the USSR exists in 2020 (sort of) AND the Japan as the enemy), the book was one of the first to take a hard look at the end of the cold war and its effects on islamic fundamentalism and the chaos in Central Asia (a common thread throughout many of his novels.) It also looks at the peace dividend and how these so-called savings get deferred to the butcher's bill.The WAR in 2020 strikes a somber tone and does not come off with a triumphant flourish where the heroes get the medals and all the bad guys get theirs. The ending leaves you wondering what the [heck] everyone died for--unfortunately, it ends like most wars. Don't get me wrong, this book is an exciting novel with its fair share of action, but it does not cop out with a comic book ending that wraps up everything in a neat package.This is a military fiction novel for thinking adults.A Personal Commentary:Ralph Peters seems to me, an under appreciated author. He is not as popular as Tom Clancy (they both showed up in the mid 80s) but I find him to be a literary and philosophically superior author. I think that Ralph does not constantly the sales Clancy does because he does not go near the nationalism trap that Clancy has fallen into. I hope that he continues to write more novels.",
            "I first picked up this book when I was in high school. Being a military junkie (the history, battles, weapons, personalities, etc.) I bought War in 2020 expecting the usual 'techno-thriller' fare - the genre where the practice of military hardware in action subordinates characterization and plot is an unfortunate occurrence. Don't get me wrong, I love the Cold War stuff churned out by Tom Clancy and Larry Bond but IHOP Peters outdoes them both.This novel was that and more. It was written by a soldier about soldiers. Peters effortlessly mixes the strategies of international geopolitics with the you-are-there immediacy of a desperate cavalry raid. You can feel Peters bristle with disdain when he describes members of the US President's cabinet while the troops from both sides (US/USSR vs. Japan, South Africa, Arabs) are men in honorable professions laboring in \"dishonorable\" times.The characters are particularly well-fleshed out, particularly US Army Col. George Taylor, the haunted commander of the 7th Cavalry (Heavy)and his loyal staff.The what-if global scenarios in the book offer tantalizing sub-plots as well - the US losing in a meaningless confrontation after losing their technological edge; the effects of a global outbreak of an incurable disease; Islamic hegemony leading to a genocidal war; the destruction of Israel and its subsequent relocation to the American heartland.The book might be dated but I feel that the timeline and real world chnages does not detract to the overall story - a great adventure that would make you think. I have literally read and re-read this book to pieces.",
            "...then he might write something like &quot;The War in 2020.&quot;Sure, Japan Inc isn't so scary any more. Yeah, we're proving now (January, 2002) that we can take on radical Islam and win. OK, so our military isn't quite as hollowed-out as we'd feared. And maybe we're still the tech kings of all the known universe.That still doesn't make this book any less scary or fun to read. The reason? It's just really well written, with living, breathing characters you really will care about. That's why Ralph Peters has a shelf life ten times that of Clancy -- and I'm a Clancy fan.Oh, plus a techno-thriller second half that will keep you up all night.",
            "For those Professional Soldiers that read, there is always one book above all others that means the most and connects most profoundly. It becomes an intergral part of that inner drive that sustains in times of frustration, hardship or danger. For me, War in 2020 is much more than simply a work of future navel gazing - LTCOL Peters has struck at the core of what it means to soldier in an uncertain future. Some commentators miss the point - decrying the fact that War in 2020 has not perfectly predicated the current reality(never mind that LTCOL Peters makes clear that that was never his intent - an impossible task for anyone). I have little sympathy for this unfortunate misconception, I firmly believe that this is a profoundly important work and transcends the limitations of the genre. For the Professional Soldier it examines warts-and-all concepts such as; inter service rivalry in a time of catastrophe, the nightmare of the future techo solution no one could predict(Nuclear weapons, nerve agents, and the horrible future of the Scrambler are weapons that no soldier could ever see coming) and the dangers of dedicating oneself to the profession of arms above all else. It is sobering, yet fascinating - and above all else profoundly moving. If you are a civilian and wish to have a glimpse at why people dedicate themselves to the profession upon which all others depend, read this important work.",
            "Should be manditory reading for future officers and US DoD personel.The biggest criticism of this book I hear is of the future history depicted inside. The future history in this book may seem implausible to many but some has already come to pass in one form or the other. This is a work of fiction and the 'history' is one plausible possibility out of many, not a prediction. Even so I didn't find it unbelivable, much is certainly still possible, and it is suprisingly often that the implausible does happen because no one is watching for it.That said, the military aspects of the first and the final battles, the future self imposed geo-political irrelevance of Europe, and the rise of new and old powers in both expected and unexpected places are good reading and stuff for good thought.Military types will like the technology, and the planning and the execution of operations.I especially like the fact that in the end it's hard to tell who won and by how much. No great march to enemy capital. Modern war seems to be like that. You'll have to come to your own conclusions.I didn't give the book 5 stars because it was a good story but a bit weak (flat) on characters.",
            "The War in 2020 has been called &quot;The military equivalent of Orwell's 1984,&quot; and it's hard to disagree with such a judgement. It is set in a nightmarish world where Japan has become a military threat once again, Russia has governed itself to the point of being reduced to figurative ash and has been invaded by Japanese-sanctioned Iranian forces and local guerrilla armies, and the US has become the last hope for Russia, in spite of the fact that the US military has been all but destroyed due to decades of neglect.Peters creates some fascinating characters and fleshes them out very well through the course of his story. Colonel George Taylor, the commander of the US Army's 7th Cavalry, is an officer infected with an AIDS-like plague, called Runciman's Disease, that attacks the brain. Shot down by Japanese gunships years before his duty in Russia, Taylor not only doesn't give a damn that the odds he faces are impossible, he almost relishes such odds.His m! en are loyal to him, for the very good reason that he has earned it. Major Howard &quot;Merry&quot; Meredith served with Taylor during rioting in California and a subsequent uprising in Mexico, and has only his wife in the States, and Colonel Taylor. Lieutenant Colonel David &quot;Lucky Dave&quot; Heifetz is Israeli, a refugee after Arab armies have incinerated Israel. Like Merry Meredith, he basically has no one else other than Taylor.One younger officer not immediately under the command of George Taylor winds up playing a decisive role with him. Captain Ryder works for Army Intelligence, and his Russian counterpart reveals an intelligence coup - a computer brain from a lost Japanese command aircraft. The Russian demonstrates a shocking truth about the computer brain that provides the Army with decisive knowledge of the Japanese-Iranian advance.Using advanced helicopter gunships with the most powerful electronic countermeasures ever conceived, George Taylor leads t! he 7th Cav against the enemy, and achieve complete surprise! - to the double horror of the Japanese commander, Noboru Kabata. A sort of Admiral Yamamoto of sci-fi, Kabata opposes the violence with which the Japanese have waged this war, and doubly opposes the terrible secret of the Scramblers, a weapon of unprecedented horror that he is forced to use.What results is a desperate final mission for the 7th Cav - a raid on the Japanese supreme HQ in Baku. But still more complications erupt, as the Russians commit a disasterous act against Colonel Taylor, and the raid must press on against odds that grow ever worse.Ralph Peters makes his scenario truly believable throughout the novel, and the allegories he draws are further worth a read. This is the kind of novel that warrants a full-scale TV miniseries.",
            "I was initially skeptical of this book (having first read it around the time of the collapse of the USSR; it seemed too far fetched) but it did not take long to warm up to the premises, the events and the author's take on various political/military developments.Though not a literary masterpiece, it is a great example of its genre, and I haven't encountered any books of this size that I was able to finish reading in 11 days (a personal record!)Now, if only Hollywood were to option the rights...",
            "Granted, this was written in the era when Japanese growth was projected as a fait accompli. In any event, it deserves to be read for its literary and political value. Tolstoy would envy Peters' ability to capture political realities as reflected in soldiers' eyes. On a purely literary level, the characters are compelling and sympathetic. Peters manages to shed light upon the dilemmas of Russian whores and Soviet apparachuks and humanizes them both.His American characters are tragically flawed in the best traditions of Shakespeare. Col. Taylor alone deserves a prequel or two. Peters, who has emerged as one of the few original thinkers in the US Army in the decade since he wrote this book, hits on the great Russian fear -- Arabs and Chinamen nipping at their \"soft underbelly\". While the author might (or might not, considering his views on the PRC in \"Fighting For the Future\") prefer to substitute the Chinese for Japan as his expansionist Asian power if he were to write this story today, he's surely correct in his main point that Russia -- with her declining birth rates and cultural torpidity -- will be challenged by rising Asian powers in the east and south. Hopefully, America will realize that, when all is said and done, she stands with Orthodox Christendom, and against Islam and the Asiatics. All in all, a page-turner on the first read and worthy of serious thought on the second!I finally got around to re-reading it. To butcher Faulkner, \"Everyone has a moment when they are Lucky Dave on the road to Damascus right before he heard the news.\"",
            "A definitive, first class take on the future of war and soldiers that fight them. Ralph Peters shows he has the expertise to create a believable, HUMAN character that one will actually root for. A haunting story of triumph and tragedy, &quot;The war in 2020&quot; is a must-read for all fans of the military thriller. Peters knows about what he writes, and has created a tale that really hits home. You may not like what happens, or how it happens, but you will definitely respect the realism and how it is played out.",
            "This was Ralph Peter's second hardcover novel, and it was published at the very end of the Cold War, when a rising Japan appeared to be poised to be the next superpower and the USSR seemed ready to explode into internecine violence.Give Mr. Peters credit for batting .500, if you ignore his timeline. The War In 2020 turned out to be The War In 1999, and we have yet to see the end of it.My biggest complaint with the story is the description of the Army and Navy as being self-involved navel-gazers, immune to learning lessons from even the most catastrophic defeat, and leaving only the Army seriously devoted to the art of fighting and winning wars. Ironically, as this book hit the shelves in 1991, the Air Force was showing us over Iraq that it had taken the lessons of Vietnam to heart.But that complaint is trivial. Many of the characters are drawn from history, and any ugliness in them is less an issue of Mr. Peters' beliefs and attitudes and far more a reflection of just how ugly we can be when we put our minds to it. The action draws, interestingly enough, on then-Captain Peters' visions of what future warfighting might demand in the way of equipment, doctrine, and soldiers. (Read his articles in The Military Review from 1986 to 1988 for more details.) It is a thought-provoking look at &quot;high-intensity&quot; war in an era advanced communications and sensor technology.And, just like real wars, the book leaves you wondering why it all ended up the way it did. It may not be as aesthetically satisfying as the rousing victory with the Forces of Darkness banished from the world, but it is certainly far more realistic.",
            "On my way to Orlando, I finished up a paperback titled The War In 2020 by Ralph Peters. It's a large paperback (607 pages) that tells a story of armed conflict in the future. Russia is falling apart due to factional fighting internally, and the Islamic and Russian rebel forces are being supplied by the Japanese. The US is no longer the leading world military power, but they don't want to see Russia overrun by Japan. They step in to balance the equation, but end up on the receiving end of a deadly weapon launched by the Japanese. Typical war thriller material.If you're a Tom Clancy fan, you'll probably like it. I'm sort of split on it. While there were some interesting parts, there were characters and subplots that had nothing to do with the main story. He has an explanation for that at the end, but I could have done without half of the book. Also, the book was written in 1991, so some of the scenarios are interesting in light of the last 14 years.",
            "I'll say one thing for The War in 2020: It's easy to read.It's also unintentionally funny, starting with the extremely dated plot. Why does every writer of espionage and military fiction assume that ethnic breakups must always be violent? Also have to love that 1980s-style &quot;Japanese Will Threaten The World&quot; paranoia? I'm sure we're all quaking in our boots as we watch Nippon sink further into its economic quagmire.Even funnier are Peters' &quot;characterizations,&quot; if that's what you want to call it. Just don't try to look at any of this book's characters from the side, or they'll disappear.I don't mind the flag-waving stuff -- there's nothing wrong with making your own country the good guy, after all -- but despite the author's insistence that he is not a racist, he certainly seems to enjoy broad, clumsy stereotypes: All Arabs are lazy and stupid, the Japanese (except for one guy educated in England) characters are arrogant technogeeks, Russians! are brave but incompetent in making just about everything from tanks to party canapes.But who reads these novels for literary characterizations anyway, right? Fine, I can accept that and enjoy the book as light entertainment if the story wasn't entirely composed of cliched devices, from the subplot involving the glory-seeking Major all the way to the inevitable suicide mission.And somehow, Peters manages to crank out a book that is hackneyed AND illogical. For instance: We're supposed to believe that the Japanese, with all of their technical prowess demonstrated in the book, will use network security protocols that were apparently created by a 9-year-old with a TRS-80 Model III. Oh, and forget redundant systems. At least the Japanese satellite and computer scientists seemed to.On the other hand, just forget this book.",
            "It starts of well with some good characters, interesting technology and fun geopolitics. However, it quickly becomes silly and implausible. A sad follow-up to Red Army.",
            "The story is fast to develop and is extremely easy to read. I find the book to be, well, too optimistic if you believe the hype that this is the equivalent of Orwell's 1984. As a matter of fact, it is not even close to matching the all-time classic. The characters are lame with too many heroic features and not enough flaws. The ending too is kind of lame so be forewarned.",
            "A good premise and many interesting conclusions about what war will look like then, but ultimately, the story is so hard to believe and to make us believe that it will hang together",
            "A real attention grabber. It is such an armagedon-like setting that I expected but didn't find spiritual value. Still, the writing of the tale gives excellent human interest views of the characters, though most of them are lost souls. A real page turner that left me wondering why God was left out.",
            "The first thing that comes to mind when reading this book is the worrying prospect that someone so prejudiced as Ralph Peters is working for U.S Intelligence! Heaven help us!This book has been criticised for portraying stereotypes and I would wholeheartedly agree. The Arabs are ignorant, uncouth slobs who do not understand technology and only live to destroy. The Japanese are cold automatons like the terrible machines they create. The Russians are sinister and slimy while tAmericans are brave and gung-ho.However, the Peters award for most insulting stereotype goes to Mexico. The bandit leader at the beginning is an unwashed, arrogant cowardly fool who despises America while spouting off 'gringo', and probably wears a sombrero and rides a donkey in his spare time.The portrayal of African-Americans is also depressing. The liberal Bliack family is shown to be naive and somehow less 'Black' than their presumably gang-banging cousins. The novel teeters on the brink of racism with every character portrayal.The collapse of order in the US also makes no sense. Runciman's disease wipes out order, everything goes to hell and then the Army moves in and clears it all up! In a flash the US solves its problems (not like all the other, backward freedom hating countries). This is an excuse to show the military as solving our problems.The book is indeed a fascinatingly gruesome depiction of an horrific worldview, but The War in 2020 is really a propaganda piece for Peter's prejudices and blind faith in the military to punch their way through to justice.",
            "Peters' works should be read for a view of the serving military. The devotion (and sometimes the self-interest) of the military. My father-in- law was USMA 1923; I so much admired him that I named my son after him.",
            "I first read this book when it came out in the early 1990's. Beyond its plot, with the Japanese being the bad guys, America falling apart, etc, it offers the interesting perspective of an author writing about the future from the past.If you are at all familiar with Ralph Peters fiction, the dour tenor of the book will not surprise you. Some of his fictional books are hit or miss (he writes excellent non-fiction as well) but this one is extremely good. The writing is lively, but dark, and the plot drips with a brooding cynicism.The imagination of the author is noteworthy. I had the chance to speak to him several years ago and asked him where he came up with the ideas for the some of the technology he used (e.g. the \"scramblers\" which destroy a person's nervous system with sound, leaving them alive but a vegetable). I figured being a military insider he was \"in the know\" ala Tom Clancy. The truth is he simply came up with it on his own. A testament to his creativity is that he told me numerous government types hit him up after the book was published, wondering where from where he was getting his inspiration as they assumed the same thing!I also admire Peters' thorough understanding of the Russian people and society. Peters is a Russian expert. I happen to know a little of them myself and I find our impressions of them are identical.If you are looking for a entertaining read, albeit somewhat depressing and fatalistic, this book is for you. I will caveat my rating in that if you do not like Ralph Peters' style, grade my review on something of a curve. If you DO like Ralph Peters, I can say this this is some of the best he has to offer.",
            "If you like fiction military books, especially with a little futuristic bend, then this book is a Great read.I purchased this book again and enjoyed it more the second time around than the first.Ralph Peters writes a easy reading book that is hard to put down.As many stars as available..",
            "Peter's tale of warfare's future--written in 1991--is excellent. In that it is now almost 20 years old, it's worth noting that many of his observations about warfare, and perhaps more noteworthy--society, have come to fruition. The book is also an excellent primer on electronic warfare.",
            "A 1990 vision of the future Intended as a cautionary tale about the end of the cold war and the peace dividend. In the War in 2020 a humbled America sends a small force armed with experimental weapons to try to save a collapsing Russia from an Japanese armed Islamic invasion. The world has been ravaged by a pandemic and has become a much more dangerous place.Peters works in several potshots at Weapons purchasing, the Air Force, Washington, and institutional insanity. Peters also works in some pretty philosophical musings about war and revenge.The book definitely shows its age. I'm old enough to remember the Soviet Union, apartheid South Africa, and when the Japanese seemed ten feet tall so the story works for me. Younger readers may be nonplussed by the State actors.The feel of the book is somewhere between \"Fields of Fire\" and a Tom Clancy book. Peters is allergic to happy endings. You have been warned.",
            "&quot;The War in 2020&quot; is one of the best books I've ever read. Very plausible geopolitical scenario: US engaged in Africa, then riots at home, finally US helping a beaten Russia. Vivid foretelling of the role of computers in near future wars.",
            "This book is set in the near future and reflects the changes in world politics as they are happening now. It is impressive in its detail and clearly the author &quot;has been there&quot;. His military history in military intelligence shows through and makes the plot much more interesting. The imaginative developments that lead to an exciting ending are a cut above the rest of the genre. He goes Clancy one better! His plot is plausible yet adventuresome! It is a book that is very difficult to put down.",
            "A good inside view about modern technics and old tactics, showing the Reader what's already possible on a Lab Bench today and will be standard in modern Weapons withhin the next 20 Years! Peters shows us that it will still be the Soldiers who will do the fighting. Modern Weapons can only be a tool. The Scrambler, which is not so abstract as an idea, will be for the 21 century what the A-Bomb has been for the 20 century.",
            "The story line and thoughts are taken from real world experience. While set in the future it is a lot closer to reality than most people realize. The employment of the aircraft as well as the use of computer software as an offensive weapon is not only well thought out but a factor under consideration today. As a former Army Aviator I can attest to the concepts as well as the validity of the story. Ralph Peters is well know in the inner circles as an innovative officer and free thinker who is a valued asset.",
            "The War in 2020 is a brilliant look ar the future of warfare, expecially the growing mechanization and de-humanization of warfare. Peters is a serving army officer, and the future weapons of war in his books are quite beliveable, and raise interesting questions about the human role in warfare.The characters in his book are not neglected in favor of the technology. The characters are well developed and the dioulauge is beliveable.All in all the book is an intellegent, if bleak, look at the future of war.",
            "Cavalry to the rescue. Riveting... exceptional; eye for detail. Clearer-deeper into the human aspect than say Clancy. Top notch writing; suspenseful-nothing missed in his human observations. Feels as if you are right there in the briefing room.Peters novel leads us up to the year 2020; not the war expected. We are loosing ground on the technological war. There is now plague, disease, and internal strife in the U.S. New technologies and weapons; impersonal machines that can almost fight on their own.His afterthoughts on the world are insightful. He believes the future is grim for Russia. There is a bigger message in the story he tells.\"Instead of becoming more worldly, I find that I only become more convinced that the United States of America is mankind's most perfect creation to date. Certainly, we Americans are not without our flaws. We have, at times, been mortally foolish. But it is only thanks to lust that even a small part of the world may live peacefully and decently today. There has never been a victor more benevolent, nor an ally so generous. Our errors were committed with the best of intentions, and our sacrifices redeemed the grimmest century in the history of mankind.\"Wish you wellScott",
            "I had never read any books by this author, and picked up the book in a pile of used books. I am not a big fan of fictional war novels even though I have read the works of Harry Turtledove including the \"Guns of the South\" and the \"Worldwar\" series. I found this book more belivable and readable than the \"Worldwar\" series.The book is dated, ( with recent events in terrorism in the world) but still comes across as a plausible story.I am looking forward to reading more of this author's work.",
            "I agree with an earlier reviewer who said Peters is Clancy's literary superior. Peters has become really my favorite living author, period. However lately I think all of us Clancy readers have been reminded of the dramatic extent to which Clancy, much more than Peters, is able to almost predict the future. The Terror War is almost something that could have come straight from his books. He's so accurate about everything that it makes me wonder...maybe he is right in his seemingly simple American nationalism as well.",
            "Yep: the theme is period oriented and that period in US history is basically done, but as a guy who was in his teens in the 80's, I can tell you that this book is flat out fantastic.I love Peters unapologetic descriptions of the flaws and greatness of America and her system. His fiction reflects well the way our government and soldiers move, think and react. I deeply enjoy the way he takes that reality and contrasts with our enemies in the book and reflects it within the heroes and their families. This, in my mind, is Peters at his best and that is saying something.I highly recommend this book.",
            "I read this book a few years ago and have never forgot it. Tried to buy it for a relative, and finally found it on Amazon. Ralph Peters is really an amazing Geo-Political author. He writes both fiction and non-fiction. I will never forget the weapon \"the scrambler\". Quite grim.Some books, once I own them, I will never get rid of them. I will keep them forever. This is one of those books.",
            "I first read this book when I was in high school in the 90's. At that time, the big worries were that Japan was going to \"Buy up the world\", and the fear of emergent diseases was pretty big.This book is a reflection of that time. A new disease that horribly scars the survivors blights the world, while Japan quarantines itself behind a defensive system. The US, as a declining is being eclipsed by the rising power of Japan, leading to conflict.The main character is a survivor of both the plague and the first lost skirmish between Japan and the US.Overall, I enjoyed this book and have picked it up from time to time over the years. I only rated it four stars because this novel reflects a specific point in history. Reality traveled a different path, but if you are old enough to remember what the concerns of the day were The War in 2020 is still a good read.",
            "\"Although Peters risks offense with his portrayal of Muslims as bloodthirsty savages\" Wow we had the blinders on in 89. Anyway... Peters writing and originality was head and shoulders above the 80s/90s techno crop. And it shows in War in 2020, probably the best of the bunch.",
            "This book, though pretty far fetched, is great!",
            "Ralph Peters skillfully gives different perspectives of a possible real-life situation. The war is believable, as are the characters. The developement of the charachers is perfect and appealing. The reader is drawn into their world and feels their pain and happiness.",
            "While this book won't win many awards for characterisationor technical believability, it does draw you into a worldwhere Europe is isolationist, the United States is indecline, and Japan is the world superpower, supplyinghi-tech weaponry to favored insurgent forces around theglobe.The heroics of the plague-scarred Colonel Taylor in actionas the last legitimate soldier the U.S. has is interestingenough to pass time and lead you to finish the book."

            "There can never be enough films or books about the dark drama of human conflict. In terms of tension, suspense, and relentless action, Standoff in the Ashes ranks right up there with the best of the genre, I put it on an equal level with classics like the Brotherhood of War books, Red Dawn, and The Triumph and the Glory.",
            "In the continuing &quot;Ashes&quot; series, author Johnstone has really issued a &quot;page-turner&quot; this time. It is all-out Civil War with the good guys being Ben Raines and his Rebel Army vs. a socialist/waco U.S. government. I could not put it down. I did not want it to end. The government that Johnstone has created, which the Rebels are defending, is a place that I would like to live. Too bad it exists only in Johnstone's mind and his creation. I have been following author Johnstone since the creation of this series, and he hasn't disappointed me yet. Great going Bill. When is the next book?",
            "I could not put this one down .Mr Johnstone keeps us on the edge of our seat with this installment of Ben Raines Rebels.This series gives his readers a little hope for what the future could be like,or might just be like if we keep letting things go the way we are.Raines REBELS all the way.",
            "What can I say. Another one of WIlliam W. Johnstone's Ashes books. I love the Ashes series. And this one is great too.",
            "As with other William Johnstone books, this book was well written and riveting. I was a little disappointed at how it ended, but that didn't keep me from moving to the next book in the series.",

            "I won't spoil anyone's reading, but this book had a cliffhanger style ending -- and I HATE cliffhangers! -- so that cost it one star.Still, an overall good read for the genre, in my humble opinion!"

            "Good book... well worth the read. This book is an interesting mosaic of genres - part (mostly) shoot 'em up war/western, part romance (read sex) and part political statement. Could this story really happen? Perhaps. Unfortunately, it would probably take an apocalyptic catalyst such as happens in this story to generate the public upheaval necessary for &quot;true patriots&quot; to make it so. Without that, Johnstone's societal vision wouldn't get off the ground. It may be tried from time to time, but only by cults, kooks and wacko survivalists. There is lots to learn from Johnstone's political statement in this book, but it IS fiction.",
            "Out of the Ashes Is a must for anyone who cares about the government, the law and what happens with a nuclear war. I started in the middle of the Ashes Series and went back and bought them from the 1st Out of the Ashes and just ordered (5) more. They are the best survival books I have ever read. They are the best books for people that are getting tired of the way the government runs our lives. They have great characters and very exciting situations in all of the books. I can only hope if this ever happens in real life we will have a Ben Raines to help us start over. I have told many people about this series and encourage others to do the same. If nothing else, the books gave me a sense of hope for our future if we wake up!",
            "At the time of this writing I have finished the first 27 books of the original series, and have started on book 28. I will not go into the premise of the story, that has been covered quite adaquately in previous reviews. And, I agree with many of the criticisms: Johnstone's writing is uneven. Most of his characters are 2-dimensional. There is much gratuitous violence and perversion. He goes over the top in portraying liberalism as BAD and his own flavor of conservatism as good. Anyone who has listened to the extreme Liberals in government with an objective ear, though, knows Kennedy, Carville, et al, go over the top themselves with their own - as Johnstone would put it - hankey-stomping snits. The major media, being the lapdogs of the Left, obediently report every word, every pronouncement while hardly ever checking the facts. I think Johnstone's counter attack of antiliberal rants echos what many of us who feel disenfranchised by the media want to say.Later books get strange, with the mutants, night people, and the Prophet's popping up from time to time. Some portions of the later books get downright boring. The series, as a whole though, is worth reading. Tri States, and the SUSA are places where I'd like to live. Johnstone gives us an ideal to look toward, in the world where even so-called Conservatives ignore the Constitution.Out of the Ashes opens the door to the Tri States philosophy. Maybe we can work toward that same return to common-sense government in the real world.",
            "This is really a rather good example of the genre. This is a post apocalyptic thriller were the bad guys take over after the collapse of civilization and the good guys, led by Ben Raines, are always outnumbered but rarely outfought.The story is not rushed and Mr. Johnstone takes his time telling the tale the way he feels it should be told. I found the pacing and narration to be thoroughly enjoyable. The politics of the main character, Ben Raines, feature prominently in the book. The politic theories held by Ben are rather interesting. Ben appears to be a kind of Social Conservative. In Ben's world if you killed your neighbor then that night your other neighbors would probably judge you and kill you. If you raped your neighbor's daughter your neighbor would have the right to take you out in back of the barn and beat you within in inch of your life. Every person would not only be allowed firearms but be expected to be trained in them and serve in the army. Men and women are treated equally in politics, familial structure and the military. On the other hand, capitalism is allowed but controlled as to make sure that money continues to flow through the system and wealth hoarding is discouraged.I really enjoyed this book. There are 25 other books in the series, thus far. The other books are also pretty good but after 26 books the plot is starting to get a tad repetitive. They are still good but it is very hard to maintain tension and suspense along with originality for that long.A good book. Read it not only for the action and battles but also for the interesting social, political commentary.",
            "This book is what started almost a cult following. It is definately not for the left wing portion of the citizenry.WWJ writes a pulp fiction style book about the obligatory post-apocalyptic world, and how a determined group of warrior idealists try and return to civilized society.The book isn't so much a work of fiction as it is an outlet for WWJ's political philosophies. Sadly enough, a large portion of what he says about the government is very true, and many of the flaws he points out are undeniable.The book is an excellant read, and the follow up books in the series are unnecessary, but decent reads nonetheless.",
            "This book makes you stand back and think about our current form of government and the way the people are treated. Also, is makes you think about how the people of the United States might one day be treated by our government that is &quot;for the people&quot;, and how the people would react",
            "For those fans of post-apocalyptic fiction, this book may fit the bill as long as one can overlook the ham-fisted dialogue and superficial treatment of complex political and sociological issues. The dialogue I found to be incredibly forced in many spots. The characters are mere caricatures, over-the-top extremists with little thought to complexities most people exhibit. Of course, perhaps the book is ABOUT extremism, but it doesn't read like it--the extremists on one side have found the \"one true way\" and everyone else is tragically, utterly wrong. Not a complex treatment of any of the topics presented. The description of the world blowing up, often the more gripping parts of this type of fiction, is afforded little attention.Merely average, basically.",
            "Ben Raines in the Ashes Series is the man that most men deep down want to be. Despite the liberal reviews it has gotten it touches a part of our ego in a way only Johnstone could write it. It is harsh and it is believable and that scares the hell out of most people. To all the liberals outt there watch out if the bottom ever does fall out. You would be lucky to have a leader rise up half as tough and compassionate as Ben Raines. For the Tri-States and the possibilites my hat is of to the authour. Keep them coming.",
            "Started to read the series in the 80's It was my first\" end of the world book\" I ever read. I never did finish the series because I ended up going overseas and couldn't find them anymore. I Look forward to finding them again & reading them all over. Great books loved his \"tri-states philosophy\"",
            "This series by William Johnstone is a must read. It was written (this is the first book) back in the 80's and depicts exactly what we are heading for and going through today! His ability to see the downfall of the USA is amazing. He's way ahead of his time.",
            "As the author of &quot;Strike Hard&quot;, I continually read books that piqued my interest. &quot;Out of the Ashes&quot;, the first of the Ashes Series, was one of the most enjoyable that I have ever read. Ben Raines seems to be a reflection of William Johnstone, thus adding a lot of depth to the character. Johnstone manages to put the reader right in the middle of the war, and its aftermath, plunging the reader into a world where chaos exists. However, there is a desire to see things set right, and Ben Raines is the man for the job. From punks to outlaws, Ben manages to strive victoriously to clear the way for the rebirth of the country, in the way it was meant to be. First of a series, &quot;Out of the Ashes&quot; is a terrific stand-alone novel, as well as an enticing beginning to a wonderful series. It is a book that I never tire of reading.",
            "America after a nuclear apocalypse? What a great idea! Not many writers are brave enough to tackle a subject matter like that, much less do it well. Sounds like an idea too big for one book? Have no fear, this is just book one in an ongoing series with continuing characters (currently 25 books and going strong!) If you don't agree with the author's political stance (an eye for an eye, let me live in complete freedom - the less government, the better), you might get annoyed with it. I rather enjoyed imagining a world where you truly get what you deserve. The book is chock-full of spys, action, twists, sex, humor, and moves very quickly. The simplicity of the writing didn't bother me, allowing me to finish it in 3 days. It also helps move it along.As for the reviewer from Chicago, I'm surprised (and confused) that even though you didn't like the book, you read &quot;seven other books&quot; in the series. I would think that (giving it a rating of 1) would have you staying far away from them... but 7 others !? I guess you are hooked - whether you like it or not - like the thousands of other &quot;Ashes&quot; fans around the world! As for your comments on people not joining the militia if they had problems with the government... it's already (and has been for a while) happening in the south, with certain groups having hundreds of members. Knowing about some of the battles in history, it is not unrealistic for a few thousand people to die on one side and only lose a few hundred on the other... great leaders win great battles.If you are tired of government and big business controlling 90% of everything in society, and would like to see what could happen without them, give this series a try. It's only in theory, of course, but it's a damn good one.",
            "I'm usually a romance book reader, but I was curious & read the back cover & decided to give it a try, something different...I found the storyline & the dialogue to be very easy-to-read & the story rolled as if written by a 'real' person (if a bit preachy, but the guy sure knows what he believes in!). It's a great 'what-if' story of the ever-popular 'end of the world as we know it by nuclear war'. What if some of the people who are left want to band together, rebuild, create a society that enforces law-abiding, the right to defend yourself & your family, & live in peace ? No racism, no sexism, everyone works somehow, no free-loaders, everyone votes on the basic laws & majority is 90%, not 51%. Anyone who doesn't want to live there, can leave. Must leave. The main character hates 'scum, thugs & slime' of humanity, rape & murder are not tolerated, for any reason, justice is swift, & everyone learns, & carries, firearms, everyone from childhood is taught self-defense. Strong emphasis on Education: if your raise children to be productive, law-abiding citizens, they won't grow up to be 'racists' or 'thugs', or will know the consequences in advance. Age-old question: Would you rob someone or try to hurt someone, if you knew that they & all their family are armed ? Parents are required to teach their children clear right from wrong, so that they are not in doubt, anyone who doesn't do that, are kicked out. These people just want to live in peace & rebuild, health care for all, everyone pulls their share, only wants people who WANT to live there, they don't 'recruit' or 'force' citizenship, they just kick out anyone who doesn't want to follow the rules. No crime, no poverty, no slums...interesting concept.& in the end, the 'NEW' government after the 'big bomb' that starts back up can't handle an independant society, living separately, prosperous, & in peace. The other side of humanity: the people who want to dominate & control, destroy for their own purposes....If you believe in the death penalty for murder, rape & child molestation; the right to bear arms; & that governments usually tend towards corruption, then you will LOVE this book. If you are a bleeding-heart that thinks that violent criminals should be 'rehabilitated' & kept in comfortable prisons with cable & access to law libraries to find a loophole to get out, then you will HATE this book. or you will cheer for the 'bad' guys in it.....The descriptions of the landscape afterwards, the effects of the germ warfare on the survivors, & how the people that are left behind interact are interesting....(it is fiction & what-if, but you never know -- possible)The weapons talk/descriptions was not as 'cumbersome' as I thought it would be, if you LIKE guns, you will like all their talk & comparisons on which is best for which situation, but if you are like me & not very knowledgable about guns in particular, you can still read without getting lost.The places that he visits in his travels have interesting back-stories.One cheesy point -- the phrase 'out of the ashes' occurs ALOT in the story...will make you roll your eyes a few times....The girl in me found alot of the parts very sad & depressing, especially the parts that are very common among people, even in this 'advanced' day & age. i.e. it's EASY to be racist & HARD to be open-minded & fair. & when some people will work hard to rebuild & help others, there are always other people who will want to kill & destroy & ruin all their hard work & good efforts.....stuff like that....Definitely worth reading, but I don't think I will attempt all 34 of them....(well, maybe #2, & remember, I'm a GIRL, ha ha !!) :)",
            "I like the post-apocalyptic genre. Like reading, watching, and writing in it. Unfortunately, a lot of it is pap. After hearing much word-of-mouth about Johnstone and his \"tri-states philosophy,\" I hoped this would be one of the better flagships for the genre.The nuclear war is triggered by a coup-gone-wrong involving rogue military hawks (think Jack T. Ripper with scads of accomplices). Ben Raines survives the dirty bomb holocaust, as do many others...inexplicably (at first I thought it might have something to do with the wasp stings). He begins touring the ravaged southeastern region, intending to document the nuclear devastation for a memoir, but is unwittingly crowned the leader of a new resistance movement. Idaho, Montana and Wyoming become his empire. But he and his followers are headed for a showdown with the other 47 states.The opening act was rather tedious to wade through. I suppose the convoluted, improbable conspiracy plot was supposed to rivet me to the pages with suspenseful intrigue as it unfolded, but I really wanted to just skim. Once the missiles struck home, and we got into Ben Raines' point-of-view, it was smoother going.If Johnstone ever explained why some people survived the radiation and some didn't, I missed it. I thought it rather unrealistic that electricity was still on for so long after a nuclear strike, and that Raines never had trouble finding gas for his vehicles. There is some mention of looting, I think, but our hero never had any trouble finding weapons, ammo, gear, food or clean water. Also, just like Captain Kirk, women throw themselves at him pretty much everywhere he goes. Nubile, supermodel-looking women, of course who \"don't like sleeping alone.\" All but twice, though, Raines and his current squeeze intuitively sensed that their affair would only be casual and temporary...and that was just okie-dokie with both parties. Such is to be expected from the genre, I suppose.I can go on nit-picking for a while, but I'll try to limit my exclamations of disbelief to just two more elements:1) His dialog is just outright painful in many places. I have come to expect this problem with inexperienced/immature (yet passionate) writers, but am REALLY annoyed when I see a successful, traditionally published author...of a popular series, no less...getting away with it. How did this ever get published as is?2) Raines is a Vietnam veteran from a super-secret elite unit which, I guess, would supposedly surpass Delta Force. But at the story's inception he is an alcoholic novelist. Almost everyone he encounters has heard of him, and read his books. And everyone is convinced he is destined to be the savior who unites freedom-loving folks and builds a utopia out of the ashes. Evidently his greatness is plain for everyone to see--everyone but his humble self. He ignores the pleas for his elevation to leadership, but is finally drug to his destiny, kicking and screaming (OK, perhaps I exagerate a wee bit). His greatness is so powerful as to inspire slavish, blind devotion in all the good guys he encounters. Apparently his alcohol-heavy diet and lethargic lifestyle have kept him in supreme fighting condition, too. I don't have a PHD in Group Dynamics or anything like that, but I've studied history, observed the surrounding culture, and worked in/with conglomerations of human beings both in military and civilian contexts. Unless God himself elevated someone like Ben Raines to power (as He did with King Saul and David), that person would never reach the top of any leadership ladder. People who rise to power...even in regulated structures...are shameless self-promoters; supremely confident in their own abilities (no matter how undeserved that confidence is); \"type A\" personalities; charismatic; ambitious; control freaks; opportunistic; remorseless; proactive and outgoing. They usually aren't the best choice for leadership, and many times are the worst. But they will beat somebody like Ben Raines in an election, mob takeover or popularity contest (which is what such things turn out to be, beneath the surface, anyway) every single time. It doesn't matter how many dead military officers have endorsed you, or even if the majority of the mob thinks you're the smartest guy with the perfect plan. The guy with the magic mouth and the zealous conviction that he is the best possible man for the job will climb higher and faster. I've taken pains so far not to be harsh or personally insulting to Mr. Johnstone, but this Reluctant Savior routine reeks of a misfit writer's closet egomania.Up to now, I've also avoided commenting on the author's political ideas, which he unabashedly rams down the reader's throat throughout the novel. I won't discuss them in detail, because they're at least as convoluted as his expository chapters. But even while preaching racial equality, Johnstone strikes me as a bigot. He also takes periodic jabs at his Religious Right Boogeymen, denouncing the cult of personality embraced by their respective sycophants (kinda like what I touched on above). Meanwhile, his own cult of personality is the driving force behind the Tri-States kingdom. Hypocritical IMO. And while pontificating on his love of freedom, Johnstone/Raines build a utopia which is, in most respects, a totalitarian regime. So while I see all the problems in the USA that Johnstone saw, our viewpoint on feasible solutions are often radically different.Plot, character(s), dialog, realism and (IMO) political savvy in Out of the Ashes is seriously flawed.Henry Brown is the author of TEOTWAWKI aviation adventure The Delayed Blitz(Krieg), as well as the military thriller Hell and Gone. He is the columns editor at New Pulp Fiction, and does some blogging of his own at the Two-Fisted Blogger.",
            "Johnstone is clearly a very talented and imaginative man. These books are truely invigorating. WWJ takes a single man from his imagination and turns him into a Legend. Ben Raines would be a true American Hero; strong, forceful, attractive and very sexy. Raines and his Rebels face danger at every turn and come out victorious almost every time. I am currently reading #9 &quot;Valor in The Ashes&quot; and I can't put it down. The excitement jumps at you from every page. And although it is something that may never happen, it is also very real. The way America thinks needs to change and Johnstone announces this in a very bold and caragious way. These books can be frightening to the left wing Americans because they don't want violence and guns in this world. But people need to wake up and smell the Willie Peter because we already have violence and guns!!!! Now all we need is Ben Raines and his Rebels to come to the rescue!!! Keep up the good work Johnstone. I'm on your side.",
            "Book 1 of the Ashes seriesPlot kernel - Rouge elements in the US Military cause world-wide nuclear and biological war - with absolutely no significant lasting health effects whatsoever for those that survive: the nukes were \"clean\" and the biological danger diffuses with the wind and time - any areas \"permanently affected\" are only briefly mentioned and then dropped from the story. It is said that 2/3 the population has perished.A writer of paperback action adventure novels, himself ex military special forces, survives the collapse of civilization. He travels about the states east of the Mississippi, meets many violent racists (he himself is not one) and generally very bad people, usually groups of men looking to rape women. He also meets the occasional woman, herself a victim of gang rape or a witness to it, who quickly and eagerly decides to sleep with him and stay, temporarily and with affection, in his company. (Rape and racism are referred to and talked about a lot in this story.)He eventually heads west and becomes the leader (the setup for this role is provided) of a break away, racially diverse, government comprising Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming: the Tri-States. Despite the (one would think) devastation of nuclear and biological war, both the Tri-States and the reconstituted US government now under the control of a radical left wing senator seem to enjoy all the conveniences of the modern world. (This is not a story about a survivalist or survivors of a world-wide war coping with physical hardship.)The Tri-States government is utopian, militant, communitarian (it seems), and judicially very severe, yet with a slight mixture of libertarian principles (prostitution, for example, is legal). Education, however, is state controlled, Biblical (the implication seems to be that evolution is out, creationism is in, although there is no explicit suggestion of anti-science) and compulsory. Those who refuse to work are deported, their children confiscated by the state, and adopted. The laws of the Tri-States are determined by an approximately 90 percent majority, and so regarded as the true will of the people. Anyone who disapproves is free to leave. Anyone who stays is required to obey or suffer the unbending consequences.The US government, now at its worst as a tyranny, will not allow the Tri-States to exist separately from the 47 other states. Complications arise.(The novel preaches against bad politics and the government which bad politics creates and then presents an alternative, utopian, society, which is not laid out well enough to really understand. The nuclear war occurs within the story merely to allow the author to clear some land, create conclaves of lawlessness to show human nature at its worst, institute a US tyranny, and set up this preferred alternative society. It is a story about tyranny and freedom fighters. This book is the first in a series that is currently 30 novels long.)",
            "A modern day retired Special Forces Soldier, Ben Raines, is certainly Smoke Jensen reborn. He certainly feels that his is the only one type of justice for evil people and that justice needs to be handed out swift and hard. In this story, after a germ and nuclear war, Ben gets to defend a Tri-State conservative area of the Rocky Mountains against the corrupt and liberal Remnants of what is left of the East Coast United States goverment.Good vs. Evil; right vs. wrong; it's all here with violence and romance. But the action really drags and the story slows with the describing of the \"perfect\" Tri-State government. If you don't mind skim reading, the ending is OK and good enough to get me to read the next story in the series; someday. \"Preacher\" is still my favorite Johnstone character with the early Smoke Jensen next.",
            "After reading this book and several others in the series, I have learned to treasure the rights I &quot;still&quot; have. The government is trying to take away our basic rights that the constitution gives us and there is not too many people who will speak up against this. However, William Johnstone is one of these people. In &quot;Out of the Ashes&quot;, Johnstone describes how the government's increasing control over us eventually leads to a revolution. Johnstone's main character, Ben Raines, is given the job of restoring america and he creates a new nation within a nation called the Tri-States. In this new nation, people make all of the laws, there is virtually no crime, and there is a plentiful supply of jobs for people who are willing to work.One thing I especially like is the fact that Ben Raines does not put up with crime or those people who are able to work but don't. The laws are straight-forward and easy to understand. The trails are quick and to the point, but fair. These are just some of the points that William Johnstone makes in this book. All in all, it will make you think twice about your rights and it will motivate you to defend the freedom's that we still have.",
            "If you are patriotic, and do not want to loose any more of your freedoms...this series (over 30 books!) is for you.This series has no middle ground. You will love Ben Raines or hate him so much you wish you could kill him yourself.Fantasic storylines & dialouge. Characters hold true to form throughout the series.",
            "I read this book more out of curiosity than anything else. I found the now 20 year old political views that swarm the book utterly fascinating, not always in a good way. The book is a not unusual (post) apocalyptic plot, flooded with political views interspersed with rather frank sex discussions. Rather too coarse to be interesting in my opinion, but I suppose that's personal view. No desire to read further into the series because the story line is not strong and not really what the author is bent on communicating. The author's website is kinda interesting, not seen anyone that prolific except certain romance authors. However, his stories are at that level... so I suppose it makes sense.",
            "this is probably one of the best books I have ever read. I love William W Johnstone, and he out did himself here. Everyone should read this book. I am now on book #8 out of 35.",
            "Awesome Book! I was introduced to the Ashes series a few years ago and read through them all in a couple of months. Out of the Ashes is book 1 and probably my favorite of all of them.",
            "Great book and great story with a great action sequence. Characters are well thought out and sequence of events is riveting.Hey, I am writing a few year's of reviews. This stuff is tedious, so give me a break.",
            "One of my favorite books. I am all for this concept of living, well later in the books. Great for trips, walking the dog etc. Just wish it was on CD or downloadable.",
            "This series is the most disappointing in my reading experience. After this book, which was mediocre, I started to read number 2 book in a lengthy series. The uncalled numerous foul language and lurid sex scenes detracted from what I thought was going to be a military thriller series. Needless to say, after the 2nd book, the 3rd was very similar and also repetitive in recalling scenes from the 1st 2 books in lengthy detail. I stopped reading the 3rd book after about 45 pages.Needless to say, I gathered up the rest of the 12 books I had purchased and not read, and put them out for recycling.In closing, I would like to state that this is my first 1 star review.Out Of The Ashes",
            "I read Out of the Ashes when it first came out and go back now and then to reread it. In fact, I've read all of Johnstone's books, since they're quick and easy reads, something for when you have time on your hands and want something to occupy your mind while waiting in, say, a doctor's office.For the most part, I agree with the TriState philosophy as regards big government, liberals and politicians; I just have a problem with how, whenever Ben Raines speaks, everybody drops what they're doing and listens to all he says with slavish devotion (what, there aren't any others around in his age group who couldn't expound on the same subject?). People, that's a cult, especially when Johnstone continually states that the movement will live on without Ben, yet whenever he's not around to lead, it all sort of goes to hell (none of them seems willing to follow Ike or Cecil unless Ben is there to enforce it).The inconsistencies in the series are irritating: Ben is 44 when the first Ashes book begins, in his mid-fifties when it ends, yet by the end of the series, he's described as being barely 50 years old. Even Lamar Chase manages to stay age 70; in fact, none of the main characters seem to age, or else age in reverse. Hmmm.Another inconsistency: In From the Ashes: America Reborn (my favorite book in the series), Ben talks about how morals were slipping and women were having illegitimate babies left and right; uh...I lost track of how many women Raines impregnated throughout the series, so either he wore alot of faulty condoms or else he always rode bareback (not smart, one would think, what with all the STDs around). And he has absolutely no interest in any of his children (a failing common with the main characters of his other books, think especially Preacher or Terry Kovak), other than Buddy. In fact, he cares more about his adopted kids than his natural ones.And finally 'all women love him desperately', especially his bodyguard Jersey. NOT a good trait in a bodyguard, since it clouds judgment. Always had me wondering if her ear was pressed to the keyhole at the bedroom door when he was entertaining a woman. Come to think of it, why did Jersey have to always be within 5-10 feet of him at almost all times, even at closed meetings with his most trusted advisors, weapon at the ready as if she suspected one of them would kill him?One more thing: That thing full of ammo that you insert in a weapon is a MAGAZINE, not a clip.In the end, I've enjoyed Johnstone's books as a momentary diversion, if nothing more, but overall, I much prefer the writings of his nephew, JA Johnstone, who's also a much better writer.",
            "Read this back in the mid 80's and still very relevant today with our skewed liberal parties. Will again enjoy the series.",
            "The main character (Ben Raines)is your typical retired 'super soldier' type that's already been done to death. The bad guys are too retarded to take seriously. The characters all behave exactly like bad Hollywood cliche's and there's a serious lack of action in the book, unless you count the constant sex Ben Raines has with every single female he meets. Roughly two hundred pages of it use the characters for social commentary; mostly anti racist critique. The author obviously did little or no research on the actual effects of NBC warfare since there are absolutely no secondary effects from the use of such weapons; no poisoned earth, no EMP,no radioactive clouds, no mutant bacteria, nothing. The author explains this away with so called \"clean bombs\". This book does not really belong to the post apocalyptic genre; it is really more the authors' way of telling everybody what he would do with America were he at the helm, and in that he repeatedly advocates invading the privacy of home so he can brainwash peoples' kids. So if you love political tripe you'll love this book, but if you're looking for a good post apocalypse survival novel you might want to avoid this. I'd recommend 'Swan Song' by Robert McCammon.",
            "After the bombs go off we have a new world but same types of people so they beginning warring all over again. Can't waIt until I get further along.",
            "I HAVE READ MOST OF THE OUT OF THE ASHES SERIES AND REREAD THE SAME ONES EACH TIME CATCHING A GLIMPSE OF WHAT THE AUTHOR WAS WRITING ABOUT. I STOP AT ALL THE BOOKSTORES IN MY AREA SEARCHING FOR ONE I DON'T HAVE.PLEASE DON'T STOP WRITING THIS SERIES ANY TIME SOON.THANKS MATT",
            "I picked up this book after a recommendation from a friend to read when I was finished with my other reads. He warned me, \"you'll be reading the rest of the books in the 32 book series\". I told him I had heard it before, but \"we'll see\". Well, this is an excellent start to a series and I hope it continues.Set in the 80's the USA is on the brink of nuclear war with Russia and China, no thanks in part to a government and military with their own vendetta's and agendas of which direction America should head. The story centers around Ben Raines, a former special operations soldier turned into an alcoholic. The book documents and parallels Ben's struggle and choices he makes as an author to travel the US and view and report the aftermath of the nuclear holocaust. Little does he know, he has been hand-picked by a former colleague to head the largest rebellion against the newly un-elected, self-appointed government hell-bent on toppling the Rebels and anyone who stand in the corrupt governments way.The novel is similar to a number of other post-apocalyptic stories out there, the big difference being this author focuses more on what he already had and not from the focus of a survivalist who had been stocking food, ammo, and supplies for years. The author uses what he has found or what he can scavenge from other areas with his focus being \"it would lay to waste and not be used anyways\".The story can be graphic at times with depictions of shooting, rape, sex, and torture; however, consider the state of mind of people at that time after a holocaust. Civility would be a thing of the past and it would become a \"dog eat dog\" world. His dream of the Tri-State \"oasis\" can be a bit difficult to accept; however, the goal of creating a utopian based society with few rules mimicking that of the 1880's wouldn't be totally un-ideal if people of like mind all sought the same goal. 65,000 people strong? I'm not sure about it, but over 9 years I suppose the possibility could exist.Overall, the book is an excellent read, better than a number of other post-apocalypse survival novels I have read in the past. I have begun his second in the series \"Fire in the Ashes\" and plan to continue with the series as I like his style of writing.My recommendation? Purchase a good condition used paperback from Amazon and enjoy your read. This is a good book that will keep you engaged within it's pages.",
            "There's a delightful touch of &quot;otherworldliness&quot; in the first few books. There's the Prophet and references to final judgement days. These topics made the series more than just a shoot-em-up bang bang men's action series. Then, alas, these references were gone: the series turned into another hum drum blase' standard run-of-the-mill blow up the bad guys standard drivel. Oh well, I still re-read the first 6 books every other year. They're great!!!! as Tony the tiger says.",
            "That's just the stuff I have been looking for 20 years to read and collect. Johnstone is a master of adventure and thrills. The main characters of the ASHES series are fascinanting - you like them from the first page. Ben Raines is not a typical hero - he is just a man who shares his vision with his rebels - and of course with the readers. I have the complete ASHES series and can surely say that Johnston loves his job. He is a natural born writer! ASHES is good entertainment and a true page turner. Those, who still do not know ASHES - please try it- you won't be disappointed. It's a dark picture of earth's future, but in a way very realistic and fascinating.",
            "So what if this could never happen, it's still good fun. Don't take it seriously and just enjoy. If you're not careful, you might find yourself reading the next book in the series, then the next, then the next, and......you get the idea. The plot is obvious, the characters cardboard, but it does have a way of pulling you in and keeping you.",
            "let me start by saying this, if the ever was or will be a Tri-States let me know. this is not a book for those panty waisted librales but a great book for a true red blooded american. From Mr. Raines veiws on crime, drugs, punks, relegion, the curent legal syestem, and even prostitution; he is an excpetional chacter and hero. In my eyes the wrold would be better off with more Ben Raines in it. Mr. Jhonstone, my hats off to you on the great writing in in this book. Also if i'd like to say that this book kicks of the series with a bang, with great chacters, &amp; events, and i hope they keep on coming back..... i know i will.",
            "William Johnstone takes an excellent and sound political philosophy and wraps it into an exciting novel.Liberals will squeal and moan when they read this book, which is good.We need the Tri-States philosophy.",
            "Johnstone's first book in the &quot;Ashes&quot; series is a survivalist's wet dream. It is chocked full of violence, stupid but sadistic bureaucrats and heroic rebels. The main character, Ben Raines, is a former special forces and mercenary soldier who has become an author. As the world falls down around him he puts his writings into practice in order to save what is left of humanity. He sets up his own country and then battles the resurected but evil US government.By the way, in all the &quot;Ashes&quot; books, all government officials are facists who sadisticaly rape, pillage, and plunder the countryside. Ben Raine's rebels on the other hand, practice what can only be called a kinder, gentler form of facism.Interestingly enough, the author's post apocolyptic world is characterized by nearly everybody but the rebels becoming sexual deviates. I don't know if this is caused by radiation or what but hardly 3-4 pages go by in &quot;Out of the Ashes&quot; without someone being raped or sodomized. By the fourth &quot;Ashes&quot; book it is difficult to find anyone left in America be it man, woman, or child who hasn't been raped and/or sodomized. Every other page is ripe with the vivid discriptions of these atrocities. Of course it is easier to justify the excessive violence in these books by the author demonizing the bad guys as sadistic rapists. It just makes it that much easier for the rebels to kill the dirty buggers.&quot;Out of the Ashes&quot; is classic pulp fiction. It is excessively violent, and has some form of sex act (mostly rape) at least every 4 pages. It is assinine in it presumptions about society and simplistic in it's assumptions of human nature. Ironicaly, it is just the kind of book to appeal to the ignorant masses that are so despised by the hero of the book. The fact that there are now at least 28 volumns in the &quot;Ashes&quot; series with an almost cult following merely proves the point.&quot;Out of the Ashes&quot; while not good literature, is somewhat entertaining in an excessively violent, sexual perverted and moronic kind of way. Have fun!",
            "I bought this book in '83 or '84. I have enjoyed them all since. I was especially pleased when Mr. Johnstone started adding new books to the series and rereleasing the older books. The first of course is the best. Thank you Mr. Johnstone for hours and hours of enjoyment and excitement.",
            "...headed in the direction the book states. I have read 'Out of the Ashes' several times and have found it not only intriguing, but informative as well. I would definately recommend this book (as well as the rest of the Ashes Series) to others. Want a look into the future? Read this...",
            "Knowing that this is a work of ficton one should not take the events of how America was brought to its knees. But rather you should look for the deeper meaning of what is actually wrong in our country. If you are happy with the direction that this country is taking,,, do not read this book because you will not understand what Johnstone is trying to say. As a person whom has read every book in the Ashes series this is a great starting point to better understanding current problems in America. William Johnstone has taken an issue that every American should take notice of, and has offered us an entertaining medium of getting that message across.",
            "I am not an atheist fundamentalist, or a political correctness freak. I wanted to preface with that. I also tried hard to view the book through the lens of the time it was written.It proved impossible. I like post-apoc fiction, but this book is easily among the worst I've read. It was a long Gary Stu projection by the author, where he gets laid every third page, all the women get raped and all the people besides him are immoral freaks. It was basically tired cliches from front to end, and I suppose that is to be expected when an author is a prolific in pulp as this guy is ... but if you want anything resembling a \"real\" fiction book, don't get this.It doesn't even hold up to mainstream stuff on the NYT bestseller list. Never mind actual \"good\" books. It seems very much like reading something I would have written in 8th grade in the 80's. which is fine, if you want your stories dictated through the eyes of a 15 year old boy in heat and whose literary experience entails reading reading fanfic on the imageboards. Not so great if you are over 18 and have half a brain.The book is among the worst I've ever read ... by far. How daft was I to buy the second one in the series as well before reading the first? Pretty daft I'd say. :(",
            "I think a previous reviewer put it best when he summed this book up as merely pulp fiction....good pulp, but pulp nonetheless.My first introduction to the Ashes series was when I was a junior in high school. As part of \"The Day After\" generation, I was always curious as to what would ever happen if....and this series of books piqued my tenth grade curiosity...Years go by and a nostalgic part of me vaguely remembers these books, but not the specific titles. After some research, I finally found them and as coincedence would have it, they are in re-print.But I digress, the storyline in the series is very basic. Ben Raines, the hero, survives a nuclear and germ warfare attack brought about by the diabolical machinations of extremists hellbent on destroying the present society to allow a better one to take its place. After some reluctance, Ben accepts his \"fate\" to re-build a society based on very strict values and he assembles together a group of like-minded individuals for this purpose. The \"good\" guys are Ben Raines and his rebels, the \"bad\" guys are the US Government, the press and any other citizen who disagrees with Mr. Raines' views.The plot is simple, the characters are even simpler and the writing is mediocre, at best. But the story is damn entertaining, assuming you can take Mr. Johnstone's over simplified social and political diatribes with a grain of salt. These books conceivably could have been made into top gossing action films (Hell, Rambo did)... meant to entertain, not elighten.",
            "This book deals with alot of problems in America today. Although it doesn't come right out and say that things need to change it does lead you around the edges of it. This book is fast-paced and full of action, It might start off confusing you but don't worry the book gets better the entire way through right up till the end.",
            "\"Out of the Ashes\" caught my attention immediately, being a big fan of apocalyptic novels and a closet fan of disaster novels. Although the Ashes storyline starts out typically, with nuclear war looming and double and triple crosses being played out all around the world, the novel slowly turns into a lengthy sermon that is likely to have political liberals fuming and conservatives and libertarians like myself hiding in shame.It's not just that the author espouses his views, it's just that the views are so one-sided and childish. The additional shame of it is that the author's attitude toward the political aspects of the story and one-sided mindset seep into every aspect of the novel. Everyone who agrees is angelic and justified, everyone who disagrees is stupid, savage and unenlightened.Paper thin characters and generalizations abound in this story, especially when the author writes about women. All women are either raped and helpless, sexually promiscuous and devious or just sexually promiscuous. If, as some have suggested, the author identifies himself with the main character, he must have an incredible libido and be irresistable to women. Or maybe just a case of extreme wishful thinking.The dialogue is weak and repetitive, especially in the showdown scenes between the main character and various bad guys.The only thing that saves this novel from a 0-star rating is that the storyline (when removed of the grade school ideology) is interesting (a splintered United States trying to reunite) and that it's pure pulp fiction fun. If anyone has seen Starship Troopers, you'll know what I'm talking about.So if you're looking for a well-written, thought provoking novel, this is not it. If you're looking for pure pulp fiction with a ton of sex and violence where good and bad are easily defined, look no further than the 25+ books of this series.",
            "Premise was good. But the thing that bothered me the most was the stupid \"sexual\" conquests. I was just put off with his hands \"going down the tangle of her pubic hair\" or \"into her wetness\". Heck this guy was the Terminator and Hugh Hefner rolled into Francis Marion and Thomas Jefferson. Then the stilted conservative speeches that passed for conversations and background made me cringe. As a believer in the free market and 2nd amendment I found this 7th grade writing project an embarrassment for \"my side\". I've read Lucifer's Hammer, Alas Babylon, Earth Abides... and many others. This was pathetic. I've finished half the book and can't get past the hand grenade trick in a Georgia roadblock. I haven't read it but I can guess that he's going to screw the liberal \"ACLU\" supporter over to the Libertarian side of life. I'll sell my copy and the two following books that were given to be as gifts when I mistakenly put this book on my wish list. How did this guy sell so many books like this? This is a great country. The author is a genius realizing that there is a market for this juvenile written cartoon.",
            "This is the first in William Johnstone's &quot;Ashes&quot; series. I've noticed it described as &quot;survivalist literature,&quot; which --though an oxymoron-- is probably as accurate as anything could be. I was surprised to find out that the author was an adult when this was written. The simple plot, the terrible dialogue, and the walking stereotypes that pass as characters made me assume it was written by a high school student... and not one from the gifted program. The scary thing is that Johnstone has written so many sequels. With the ultra-right element so vocal in America these days, I imagine it really does pass for literature among the militia types. Btw... I bought the sequel, thinking it might get better. It doesn't. It actually gets worse. And after reading this one, that's hard to believe.",
            "I really tried to finish this book, after all I paid good money for it and I like post-apocalyptic fiction, but this book is just ridiculous. I kept hoping that it would get better but by the time I was half way through I realized it was only getting worse. The author couldn't decide if he wanted to lecture us about the evils of big government and society in general or titillate us with second rate (make that third rate) smut. DO NOT waste your money on this drivel.",
            "I read this as a paperback many years ago, as well as many of the books in the series. I remember enjoying them. Not so much now. I have grown, my politics and my world view has expanded. My self awareness and training have reached an advanced level in many areas.This book is still a fun read, but the whole thing is a cliche. It would be the equivalent of the \"Commando\" movie while books along Patriots, Jarkata Pandemic and One Second After would win Academy nods.First the stuff that is not so good:The story is based on a military coup involving the USA, China and Russia that ends in biological and limited nuclear warfare. Special Forces groups discover this prior, but somehow let the war happen. The main character is former SOG that survives by being in a coma due to wasp stings during the exchange.Then he happens to bed every lady he meets. Even the ones that hate him, and they love him for it. Yeah, right.His choice of weapon is a Thompson .45, even over M-16s (the book is a bit dated). His ideas on combat and self defense are suicidal.Now the things I like:Ben is a cool character for this type of fiction. He is a typical macho my way dude.Not someone I would get along with for lenghts of time, but fun to imagine in the situations presented.The action is evenly spaced and fun to read.Politically and socially I agree with a good portion of the main characters motivations and words.Save your money and borrow this from the library. If you still want to read about Ben, then come back here and get the rest.",
            "I was really looking forward to reading this book but it disappointed me. The plot and charaters at the begining are hard to follow. Then the book degenerates into basically the sexual exploits of the main charater and unprobable gun fights. This book is really adolescent and appears to be written by a teenager. I got about halfway through the book and it did not appear to be going anywhere getting any better so quit reading it. Maybe Amazon will buy it back slightly used.",
            "While this is the first review I have ever wrote I'm sure my opinion will vary. I am a sci-fi, post apocolyptic, TEOTWAWKI, SHTF, kinda reader. For ideas and for enjoyment.The scenes are well played out and have a very possible distinction. Not very many far fetched ideas or acts that seemed stupid. The \"sex scenes\" were too graphic for younger crowds. I look forward to the next book in the series. I just hope that they don't get stretched out for to long and start to fade.YMMVJohn",
            "I've read all of the Ashes series, as well as every other book by Johnstone. The author is not trying to win an award for literature. His purpose for writing his stories is a warning to the reader about the inevitable results of the direction of our country.The most harsh critics of Johnstone's books attempt to dismiss his warnings as something only simple-minded extremists would seriously consider. These critics are in denial; they are fearful that there really is a group of Americans who would break away and start their own nation and establish their own set of laws. These critics have reason to fear. Johnstone's Ashes series is prophetic in the sense that we have no leadership with vision and we have a citizenry without the backbone to stop the government from creating such an outcome.When it comes, I will be with SUSA. There will always be critics and whiners. I would rather be part of something great that has no chance of winning than to lie down and let the left turn our republic into another failed socialist experiment.",
            "This is by far my favorite novel of all time. I have two copies, one which I have read over and over again, and one which I am saving in mint condition. The themes helped shape my views when I was a teenager, and offered some sort of moral and politcal focus as well. I have given it as a gift to friends and family in the past. I whole-heartedly recommend this book.",
            "This book brings Americas troubles to the forefront of our conciousness. Mr. Johnstone uses so many tools to get the point across to us the readers, it's truly amazing!!",
            "The beginning of the book is excellent; with a rebellion brewing and nuclear apocylpse approaching. The story continues with the day-to-day survival of people across the country. Ben Raines eventually ends up recruiting a base of survivers and sets up a new state- Tri-State. This is where the book goes downhill; it goes downhill fast, in a very short period of time. He sets up his state and turns it into a conservative-utopia (an oxymoron in itself). A barbaric society results. A society with very few morals. A society that at times reminded me of Orwell's 1984. It almost seems as if Johnstone attempted to make more of a political statement than tell an entertaining story. If you are a good true blue American liberal, such as myself, don't bother with this book.",
            "I have read this and seven other books of the &quot;in the ashes&quot; series. Frankly I just don't like them. They are pretty poorly written and are not something that looks like it will happen. Ben Raines and his army go around America distributing Uzi's to farmers and telling them to fight. Yeah, right. Johnstone seems to think this SUSA army is invinvcible, going around America killing hundreds of thousands of criminals and losing something like a few hundred Rebels. He seems to think everyone is fed up with the American goverenment. While we may have our problems with it, we would not just go and join some Soldier of Fortune militia. If a real life &quot;Raines&quot; ever took his army and formed a new country he would be smashed by Americans who wouldn't put up with that kind of crap. &quot;Raines&quot; real army would be filled with a bunch of military rejects. This series is one of the worst I have ever read. Don't waste your time looking at it.",
            "This book got to me because we are so close everyday to being destroyed by nuclear weapons. The character of Ben Raines reminds us that every American should be Free.",
            "Ben Raines...retired Soldier of Fortune, writer, patriot. He's the one to lead a decimated nation OUT OF THE ASHES! A very readable and entertaining novel, and also a critique of how empty-headed liberalism (redundant) is destroying society. Ben and his Tri-Staters tell the Federal Government to kiss their collective tookus (would that we all could do so). I have *every* ASHES book, and the first,as always, is the best....give this one a try, and you'll be hooked! I guarantee it! :)",
            "Regardless of your political leanings, this book is an ill-conceived mess. The writing is barely above the fourth grade level, the characters are cardboard cutouts and the kindest thing that can be said about the plot is that it's absurdly choppy and uneven. The political views espoused by the author are so bizarre as to define explanation. The protaganist is presented as a far-right conservative who proceeds to excorciate the rich for failing to support the poor and seems to champion near-communistic wealth redistribution. Huh? Despite a right-wing, 'superpatriot'-initiated, worldwide military coup that has brought on armaggedon, every character is happy to blame the evil liberals for everything that has ever gone wrong in the history of the world. But it's not just the politics that make no sense: picture the scene where the protagonist calmly loads up on .45 ammo at a sporting goods store after complaining loudly several pages earlier that those damn liberals outlawed all personal firearms over three years ago. Johnstone creates such a lame apocalypse that the electicity is still on and his characters can cheerfully get gas at every gas station a full ten days after the nukes landed. If you absolutely must read right-wing, post-apocalyptic survivalist paperbacks, do yourself the favour of checking out James Axler's Deathlands books instead of this irredeemable drivel. Still, I have to give credit when it's due: most of this book is unintentionally hilarious.",
            "This book is beyond description. It reads like an eighth grader wrote it, but without the deep thought of said middle schooler. The action is jumpy, the text almost pure exposition, and over half of the book is devoted to an extended rant/diatribe. And even the diatribe is unorganized, jumping from &quot;get tough on crime&quot; speeches to the main character's desire to &quot;screw&quot; a reporter he sees on television. All this being said, I couldn't put it down because I couldn't stop laughing. If you've ever wanted to look at truly bad pulp fiction with no attempt at organization or editing, be sure and pick up this book. I also enjoyed the author's musings on the coming race war. Thanks for the info, Johnstone! You are truly the greatest American hero.",
            "Back in the mid 50s, Director Ed Wood made \"Plan 9 From Outerspace\" which has been called the worst movie ever made. Despite its glaring problems, the movie has become wildly popular. This book has lots in common with Mr. Wood's opus.I wont detail all the problems with \"Out of the Ashes\". The writing is shoddy, the plot is silly, there are tons of logical errors and the political/moral philosophy Mr. Johnstone seems to advocate is disjointed and childish. The action sequences are often decent but you have to put up with multi-chapter rants between scenes. All this makes for a novel so wretched and horrible you just cant put it down!A word of warning though. This book is actually the first of a series that tells the tale of super-patriot Ben Raines' effort to rebuild America as it should be in a post-apocalyptic world. Ive read a couple of the installments. The strange charm one can find in the first book does not carry on to later novels in the series. Dont bother with the rest of the \"Ashes\" series. They have absolutely no redeeming qualities.",
            "I read \"Out of the Ashes\" a long time ago and could not remember much about it, so I ordered it on Kindle. Right now I am burning through various \"apocalypse now\" novels, and I wanted to see how this old soldier stacked up. The answer is, not well. This novel has not aged well and was not very good when it first came out. First of all, there is a lot of racist language in the book. I understand that the author was trying to be authentic and that some people really do talk that way, but it got so bad that I could not deal with it. That and long diatribes by the book's protagonist, Ben Raines, on his theory of how the various ethnic groups in America can, should, or cannot, get along are pretty awful. About 2/3 through this novel I realized that I was not enjoying it and was in fact completely put off by it.Even for readers who are not bothered by the constant ethnic diatribes, this is not much of an \"end of the world as we know it\" or \"survivalist\" novel. There is almost no detail in here about how people might survive a nuclear war (the cause of the apocalypse in this particular novel.) Basically, if you believe the author, people quietly die, there are lots of cars, gasoline, grenades, guns, food, and other goodies left around for the inexplicable survivors, and everyone can just get down to the serious business of killing and fornicating. Pretty dull really. \"Patriots\" and other novels of this genre are infinitely better than this one. There is almost no \"survivalism\" in this novel. Everything is just there, including bad guys to be killed every 20 pages or so.I know that there are almost countless novels in this series, so some folks obviously like it. I tried to like it but cannot, hence this negative review. RJB.",
            "OK, so this story doesn't have the most original or deepest plots in the world, but what it does have is a strong political and social philosophy, and presents it in an interesting fashion.Mr. Johnstone's protagonist, Ben Raines, leads the way as a warrior-philosopher fighting the human scum rising to the top after World War Three destroys the world. Along the way, he hooks up with a group of survivors, and together they form a nation without crime, poverty, or injustice.Of course, the Washington liberals can't tolerate that, and destroy it.The book is over the top and sometimes thin, it's still a good lead into an exciting series.",
            "This book makes an attempt to validate the most exasperating elements of the far right and far left. Taking children away from their families because they don't agree politically with Johnstone's utopian government and a sliding tax rate that places an extreme burden on the wealthy are just some examples. On the plus side, not a bad survivalist fiction.I would instead recommend PATRIOTS; Surviving the Coming Collapse by Rawles as an all-around better book with more palatable politics and solid survivalism information.",
            "Enjoyed this book very much. Premise based on a WWIII scenerio, with Germ warfare as well as Nuclear. Hero is Ben Raines, a &quot;Hellhound&quot;, turned soldier of fortune, turned writer. Set in a decadent America (much like today), story portrays development of &quot;Tri-States&quot; philosophy of government--government truly by the people, with simple, easy to understand laws, enforced to the letter. Book details development of this philosophy through the destruction of Tri-States area by a reconstructed federal government which tries to be everything for everybody, and winds up satisfying nobody. Tri-States philosophy emphasizes personal responsibility/accountability for ones actions, which seems quite refreshing. Heartily recommend this book and all others in series...",
            "This is one of the first post-apocalyptic series of books ever published. This book preaches self reliance, common sense government, a unified health care system and I almost forgot the Right to Bear arms. The stories revolve primarily around the adventures of one Ben Raines who I have to admit kicks more [bottom] then Dirty Harry. The series is primarily his own personal Eden The \"Tristates\"(a cool name). I can agree with enough of what these books are saying(and the action scenes) to enjoy them. If you want to read good pulp fiction go ahead and read these books.",
            "The first 10 of the ashes books with all the side line storys are the best, yet the others stand on their own also. Tri States.. Hell yes, we need that kind of law and order.I dont agree with every thing he says but &quot;William J. Johnstone &quot; sure has some good ideas. All of his Adventure books are good, even the two that he wrote under another name. Check out Eagle Down and Dagger by William Mason and you'll see what i mean..",
            "Check out the one star reviews of this title: virtually all of them were written by people (like myself) who are fans of post-apocalyptic fiction and widely read in the genre. This book is among the worst I've ever read, not only of that small sub-genre, but of books in general. Why?-the dialog reads like the fantasy of a teenager c. 1979-the plot is even worse-it slides from \"gun porn\" (boring, needless details about the internal workings of the Thompson sub-machine gun) to some of the worst sex scenes written since the script for Barbarella-it's sexist (and not in an interesting way)-it's racist (and not in a provocative way)-it's deeply hypocritical in its politics, ethics, and morals-it's so poorly written it will make your teeth hurtI stumbled on this book by accident (by searching the keyword \" apocalypse\" at the public library). I was surprised to find not one, but a whole series of books that I had never encountered, especially since I was deeply into this genre when the book was originally published during Reagan's first term. The fact that there's an entire shelf of books by William Johnstone in the public library is testament to the fact that you can't go broke selling crap to Americans.Bottom line: if you like teenage libertarian sex & gun fantasies there are better ones out there. Out of the Ashes offers up all a fifteen-year-old Ayn Rand reading, Call of Duty playing, never-dated-a-girl-yet boy could want. But if you're 16 or older, have a thing for quality writing, aren't into rape, or think certain ideas about the separation of races went out of style in fiction before the original Star Trek was on TV, this is one you should pass by.Really. It's that bad. Save your time and go re-read Lucifer's Hammer instead.",
            "I love survival fiction, and i can almost always make it through a book, however bad. This one was just too painful, and I gave up halfway through. I won't go into plot, others have done so already. It sounded good from other reviews, so I gave it a try. Big mistake.The book reads like a high school creative writing class assignment. The main character is two dimensional and an obvious fantasy the author wishes he was. Each of the female characters encountered turns out to be beautiful and sexually interested in the main character. Apparently all the ugly women died when the world went to hell. The writing style is abrupt and juvenile, making it tough to get into any scene as it takes place. Predominately the author describes action, and even that poorly. It is also hampered by the fact that he is writing about a military character and coup with little apparent knowledge of the military, those who serve, or firearms. While I, myself, have never served, I'm embarrassed for the men and women of our armed forces by this portrayal of them.The author's fantastic approach to firearms is obvious by the continual use of full automatic weapons by a \"special ops\" character. Denigrating the M-16 (admittedly not always liked by vets) by refusing to have his character take one, instead favoring a pistol, submachine gun, and explosives goes against the common sense of everyone who seriously knows firearms. A pistol is for when you don't have a rifle, and a submachine gun is a short range solution. Why not take a rifle, even a bad rifle, when in a survival situation? Points like this populate the book.Additionally, the book comes strongly across as conservative propaganda. Issues like racial tension are handled as if violence between races is inevitable, slightly veiled by the fact that the main character doesn't quite agree. And while I, personally, may agree with some of the political stances of the main character, the way they are presented and pushed makes the whole thing feel preachy and contrived.Short version, save your money",
            "From the first page this book will put chills down your spine. This really could have happened a few years ago during the cold war era. People living in their &quot;dream world&quot; now could learn alot about how the government works. We would have a lot less problems if justice was served the &quot;Ben Raines&quot; way. Thanks Mr. Johnstone",
            "I would recommend this to anyone who has every played Fallout 3. Quick read with a long series, couldn't have asked for more for a 9 month deployment to Afghanistan."

            "This is a fine exploration of the various ways the world could end. I disagree with the other reviewer here for the stories are about people coping with disaster, trying to find ways to salvage something out of the wreckage. The stories are divided into two categories. The first stories in the book are about how man brings disaster on himself (nuclear war, overpopulation, etc.) The last half is of disaster coming upon the earth (asteroid strikes etc). What makes the stories enjoyable is that they are about survivors, not victims. In fact, one story details a desperate plan to avert the threat of overpopulation -- at a terrible cost. Most of the stories really fall into the action/adventure category with the stakes being extremely high.",
            "This is the perfect book for people who see the human race as the Earth's cancer. If you think the human race deserves to be wiped out, you'll be in for a treat.&quot;Armageddons&quot; is a collection of twelve short stories about the end of the world, imagined by some of science fiction's best known writers. The twelve stories are imaginitive scenarios that describe how the human race could become extinct, whether it be through nuclear war, plague, pollution, or natural disaster.It's amazing how pessimistic some people can be. You wonder if some of these writers are really telling stories or setting down prophecies.Anthony Burgess once had something to say about apocalyptic stories. He believed that so-called &quot;warnings&quot; about the end of the world were really just wish-fulfillment. There is a part of us that deperately wants the apocalypse to come. That's why it captures are imaginations so much. Burgess was mainly referring to stories about the third world war. Still, there could be something in what he said.If you ponder things like the end of the world then &quot;Amageddons&quot; will definitely whet your appetite.",
            "Were 13 stories picked for this collection because Western culture associates the number with bad luck and surely the ending of civilization as we know it is &quot;bad luck&quot; in the extreme? Regardless there are both really good stories and really boring stories in this collection -- I use boring purposely because the writing isn't bad, some of the stories are just boring. Normally I like Nancy Kress but her piece &quot;Evolution&quot; was slow and it wasn't clear what disease was being fought. Frederik Pohl's &quot;Fermi and Frost&quot; was a bit hard to follow as we jumped from one character's view to the authors. Gregory Benford's &quot;A Desperate Calculus&quot; wasn't well-paced and it seemed like a surprise when the cause of it all was revealed. Richard Cowper's &quot;A Message to the King of Brobdingnag&quot; lacked characters I could relate to though the idea of advancements in agriculture ending the world was new for me. &quot;...The World, As We Know'T&quot; by Howard Waldrop had both interesting characters and an intriguing replay of 19th century theory. Both Gardner Dozois' &quot;The Peacemaker&quot; and Raccona Sheldon's &quot;The Screwfly Solution&quot; look at doomsday cults and the horrorific spread of them. The characters which grabbed me most were in Fritz Leiber's &quot;A Pail of Air&quot; -- I wasn't expecting it to grab because I normal hate his work. Allan Danzig's &quot;The Great Nebraska Sea&quot; reads like a history book. &quot;Inconstant Moon&quot; by Larry Niven was also unexpectedly good and positive. Geoffrey A. Landis' &quot;The Last Sunset&quot; was too short to get me involved much. And finally &quot;Down in the Dark&quot; by William Barton was so long and so paced that I gave up on it.",
            "For those not familiar with the format, Jack Dann and Gardner Dozois have compiled a large number of themed anthologies each of which contains a number of stories dealing with a single topic. This book fills its 269 pages with twelve stories on the subject of the end of the world. They date from 1951 to 1998. Five of those stories are well worth reading but the rest are filler.The finest story here is &quot;A Pail of Air&quot; by Fritz Lieber. It tells of a dark star passing through the solar system and dragging the Earth away. Without the sun it gets so cold that even the air freezes. How can people survive in this world? The other truely outstanding tale is Frederick Pohl's &quot;Fermi and Frost&quot; which describes a world slowly freezing over in the wake of a nuclear war. If you have not read those two stories before, they pretty well justify buying the book.Gregory Benford, Nancy Kress and Raccoona Sheldon (aka James Tiptree Jr.) merit mention for their three stories all of which deal with the potential of advanced biotechnology to finish us off.The remaining stories do contain some interesting ideas but in general, they are just not very well written and I think that the editors could have been more critical in the material that they included."

            "I tend to get bored with books within the first twenty pages, but the book grabbed my interest and didn't let go. It read pretty fast which is both a good and a bad. But the book itself was interesting.A few people mentioned it was pretty dated. The book is set from when it was written - don't be surprised when certain things are described differently than we really know they are. Think of it as a look from what someone in the '50s thought the world would be like. Likewise, don't be surprised at the tones that make any of the women seem like not a valuable character. For instance, I couldn't find myself liking the main character's fiance just because of how she was written, as a feeble and temperamental woman. She was supposed to be about his age but read as if she was 60.I don't want to spoil anything and so I can't give much more of a review, but the writing is great. A few things were either overlooked in the proof reading or were typed up wrong when it was converted to an eBook but aside from what I mentioned, I loved it and couldn't put it down.",

            "Yes, I have. Finding this book on Kindle transported me back to my youth. I picked up my first copy of Astounding Science Fiction at a drug store in Cicero, Ill. in July of 1947. Imagine, up til then my only touch with SF was Buck Rogers and Planet Comics. Imagine my glee when I went to a large magazine store and found Amazing Stories, Startling Stories, Planet Stories, and many others. I began collecting back copies of ASF and now have an almost complete collection though 1970.I can't remember where I first read this story, but I've thought of it many times over the years. Sadly my copy disappeared over the years. The reviews brought the story back to me.I must thank Amazon for bringing out so many \"Oldies\" on Kindle. I look forward to saving many hours going through my old collection looking for stories that popped into my mind.My first read will be \"Despoilers of the Golden Empire\" by Randall Garrett. If you haven't read it, be aware that it is a great example of the old \"Space Opera\" theme of most old pulps.Happy reading!",

            "A solid science fiction effort. Certainly no classic, but generally well written and interesting. The story unfolds nicely as the residents of a small city try to find out why the world around them has changed so much (and why they are still alive!) after a nuclear bomb hits their town. City at World's End is 1950's science fiction and not for all taste. It will probably be enjoyed most by those who enjoy Ray Bradbury or the original Star Trek TV series.",
            "This book's strong opening chapter confronts scientists with the unthinkable: a superatomic bomb has fallen on Middletown, a small American city hiding a secret antiatomic laboratory, servering it from its surroundings; the sun is now red and drawn out, the moon is unrecognizable, the temperature is low. Various hypotheses are considered to explain all of this, and the most unlikely might well be the one closest to the truth. After the initial event has occurred, transmission of knowledge proceeds in a myriad of interesting ways: between scientific and non-scientific Middletownians at first, but then between strangers from the future - some apparently human, some not - and scientific Middletownians (who take on the role of their non-scientific peers because of their relative ignorance). Even though they generally remain on the good side, the 20th century humans' role is decently complex and shows a nuanced way of approaching the space opera subgenre of science-fiction: they frequently reverse roles with `the other' and even become an historical curiosity under the eye of an historian from the future. This novel's structure is careful, every step being taken with a studied internal cohesion and sense of pace. Its position on science remains ultimately optimistic, but it does acknowledge some of the dangers it could cause and offers an original kind of civilization shock.",
            "A small town in the mid 1950s, population about 50,000, is suddenly displaced through time and finds itself on a dying planet that circles a dying star. Soon it becomes clear that they are still on Earth, but are millions of years in Earth's future. The problem: survival.Although I found it a little predictable in places, this novel held my interest and is well written and well formated for the Kindle. The writing is in the 1950s style, so a few of the author's facts are a bit dated. Overall, however, the story line holds up well.",
            "The thing about going back and reading old SciFi is to keep in mind that this was the beginning of the modern genre and you have to keep your expectations at a reasonable level. Hamilton, like many authors of this era, had abiding faith in technology, a lack of understanding of the basics of ecology, and a generalized belief that all government was, in the end, incompetent at best, venal at the worst. Of these the last remains a worthy theme of SciFi.This book is highly recommended as a good, short SciFi novel with a very interesting story. The other reason is that for Kindle readers you can get it for free, or close to it! Hard to pass that deal up.",
            "I read this book in my early teens in the 60's, and then lost it, and have hunted for it ever since. At last, a friend found it and sent it to me, and last night, I read it again and held my breath to see if it was as good a story as my younger self thought it was.To my surprise, it really was. It's obviously very dated, and there's some sexism in there that made me grit my teeth. (Especially the bit about the main [male] character's frustration with the inability of the female mind to grasp scientific concepts! Grrr.) And then there was the people's unquestioning faith in science to solve every problem, so that all the scientists had to do when people were panicking was assure them that the science was reliable, so therefore everything would turn out okay. That made me smile a little fondly, at the good ol' days.But apart from some of those things, the story really does stand up well. It was an excellent examination of what might have happened to people whose entire town had been thrust far into the future of an almost-expired earth. The story poignantly conveyed the loneliness of the arid world, and the deep loss felt by the people, yet it also portrayed their resilience and the power of the human spirit to adapt and bring good out of something terrible.It definitely resembled the first Star Trek series, in the way it had such faith in that resilience and human spirit. In much the same way as many Trek episodes, you got that scene where the undaunted human being stood alone in front of a galatic council, reminding the star-flung descendants of his world that they owed all their high principles and peaceful lifestyle to the struggles -- and yes, wars -- that the people of his time went through. Very rah-rah humanity.And yet, the book brought great sensitivity to the question of what it means to have roots. What would it really mean to a community to be wrenched out of the world they knew, with all its interconnections and its known history? And then to be told that what was left of their world was so uninhabitable that they'd even have to leave it, and move to another world altogether? Where is the breaking point, and how much of your own genealogy/history can you leave behind without becoming another type of being altogether?What struck me as I considered this question was that it would have been harder in the fifties, when the book was written, than it is now. To this author and his characters, the thought of going to the stars induced panic, because the earth was what grounded people, and once they'd lost that foundation, they'd be totally lost. Yet now, after a generation or two of science fiction books and movies and television series, the idea of being a galactic citizen rather than solely an earthly citizen isn't the fearsome thing it used to be.Or rather, it's not as fearsome for a large number of people. I suspect there are still a lot of people who would feel horror at the thought of stepping off the earth and having to broaden their world so much. It may just be psychologically impossible for some people. And that's one of the main points of the book.So aside from a few of the things that date it, I'd say it's still an immensely relevant story.",
            "I first read this one in the mid 70s. I enjoyed it then and after digging through my storage rooms (I never throw anything, in particular books away), I found it and read it again. Certainly different than the standars SiFi we get today. Anyone interested in tracing the evolution of SiFi would certainly be interested in this one. The book is well written, well crafted. While, as one reviewer put it, it will never be a classic, it certainly is worth a second look. Recommend it highly.",
            "I really enjoyed this book. For only 99 cents I wasn't expecting much, but was nicely surprised. I really liked the main character and was really drawn in to the story. I would recommend this to sci-fans.",
            "I discovered this book thru John Byrne, a comic book artist who had created a few concept sketches for the characters. He said it was his favorite scifi book, and being the John Byrne fan I am, decided I would probably like it to. And I did--a lot!This book begins in a small town during the mid 20th Century that is sent millennia into the future by the blast of a super atomic bomb that ripped the spacetime continuum. The book follows the journey of one scientist who helps the people discover where they are, when they are, and what to do about it. They discover a domed city long abandoned by humans who have fled to the stars. They meet aliens and learn how laws and government haven't evolved after countless years.What I liked about the book was the journey you follow along with the main characters. You discover the future one piece at a time. You also see how people don't seem to ever evolve-they're just as conniving, scheming, and treacherous as ever. I also enjoy the characters and how you get to know them thru their reactions to what's going on.This book was written half a century ago so some of the science isn't current, but that won't stop you from enjoying the book. It's a very good piece of speculative fiction.",

            "This book was pretty good - not great, but it's a pretty good story, and also interesting as a glimpse of sci-fi history.The setup of the story is like something straight out of the Twilight Zone - quiet middle-American town, transported in the blink of an eye into the distant future. The inhabitants quite naturally have a whole range of reactions to this, mostly quite provincial, which sets up the first half of the story: how to survive in this far-future Earth.The second act brings in more of your classic space opera stuff: far-flung galactic federation, faster-than-light travel, aliens, and all kinds of far-out technology, with a conflict that is essentially the little guy vs the big institution. As it plays out, I couldn't help be reminded of all of the original Star Trek episodes where Kirk et al run into various super-advanced races or all-powerful computers, which nonetheless have very human failings, and Kirk makes inspiring speeches pointing out the depravity of the supposedly advanced race or infallible computer (Kirk had a way of getting computers to self-destruct with speeches like this). Or put it a different way, the humans of a million years in the future are ultimately still human. So this is one part of the social commentary of this book.The other part of the social commentary surrounds the reactions of the townsfolk, and the general fear of change, which may manifest as swagger and belligerence. I couldn't help but think of Sinclair Lewis's \"Main Street\", with the smug, self-satisfied townsfolk who are quite happy with things the way they are and endlessly suspicious of things that are presented as improved or advanced - what do I want with a starship when I've got me a Chev-ro-let, that sort of thing. I probably drew the connection to \"Main Street\" because of a couple of the main character's names: Kenniston, and his girlfriend Carol (cf. \"Carol Kennicott\"). Maybe just a coincidence... Anyway, fast forward to the 21st century, I would like to think a lot more people would be open to change. When presented with the choice between a dying earth with a dying sun, and a whole universe teeming with life and advanced technology, I'd go with the latter.An interesting point, which is somewhat common to sci-fi of this era, is rather unflattering portrayal of women. The female characters, such as they are, are rather flat and thinly drawn, and not very likeable. Probably intended for a primarily male audience.",

            "This Kindle reprint of the classic early science fiction novel THE CITY AT WORLD'S END by Edmond Hamilton appears to be an illegal violation of the rights of the author (or their estate) and is a clear violation of Kindle and Amazon policies and terms of service. The book itself is vintage Hamilton done in the pulp magazine style of the 1940's and is a good read if you like that sort of thing. This novel, along with much of Hamilton's other work over many decades, inspired and influence a lot of modern science fiction authors. However, because this particular Kindle edition has clearly been published without permission of the author's estate, I have to give it 1-star and urge people not to purchase this edition, but to go look for a legal edition.Copyright Citation: Del Rey Books (a division of Ballantine), re-issued THE CITY AT WORLD'S END by Edmond Hamilton in 1983. I have a copy of that edition my own bookshelf. It clearly has a valid copyright statement inside it, proving the copyright *was* renewed and in effect in 1983. If it was valid in 1983, it would still be valid today under current law. The ISBN number for this edition is 0345309871 (10-digit ISBN) or 0-345-30987-1 (13-digit ISBN). Just plug either number into a Bing or Google search to confirm it. Anyone can find out information like this by going to Abebooks dot com and doing an author & title search. It is not hard to find out copyright information on a book -- but you do actually have to try and do so -- you can't just sit around and say, \"Hmmm... it's old, the author is dead... it's probably not copyrighted...\"A lot of people are now putting out Kindle editions of copyrighted material and simply not doing the due diligence the law requires and are just assuming that because a book is 'old' or the author is dead that its copyright is no longer valid.Bottom Line: The law puts the burden of determining if something is covered by a valid copyright on the person who wants to reprint it. It is their responsibility to find out if the book or story they want to publish is in the public domain or not. If they don't do this and publish copyrighted material without permission -- as is the case with most of the people putting up these Kindle reprints -- that ignorance does not excuse them or protect them from a lawsuit if the copyright owner finds out about it. Actually, Amazon is also exposed to liability because Amazon is an active, participating accomplice in these criminal activity -- I am amazed their lawyers have not made Amazon do something to stop the runaway copyright infringement which has become widespread in the Kindle Bookstore over the past year. Legally, Amazon is enabling this pirating of copyrighted material and Amazon makes about makes about $1.00 on each and every pirated copy sold!If the publisher of this edition of THE CITY AT WORLD'S END by Edmond Hamilton did actually have permission from the copyright holder to publish the book, he obviously would have included it on the copyright page of his Kindle edition. But this publisher has included NO copyright page of any kind in his Kindle book, much less anything stating it has been \"reprinted by permission of the estate of Edmond Hamilton\" or their agent. This Kindle edition of THE CITY AT WORLD'S END is clearly a pirated version of a copyrighted novel, plain and simple.This review serves as a notice and warning to potential buyers about the nature of the book -- and if they should buy it or not -- just as any comment on the plot or writing would do.I have to urge buyers to avoid Kindle editions of modern science fiction classics by well-known authors from the 1940's through the 1960's -- unless it contains a valid copyright statement (which you can see by using the \"Look Inside\" feature. Virtually all classic science fiction books had their copyrights renewed and have had copyrighted mass-market paperback editions published by commercial publishers in the 1970's, 1980's and 1990's. Because a book is 'old' or the author is dead does not mean it is no longer copyrighted.People should start posting 1-star reviews of these illegal publication to alert potential buyers what they might be considering purchasing. If Amazon will not act in their own defense and the defense of the entire Kindle concept, then apparently the users must do it for them.Based on the Kindle reprints I have checked copyright on, I estimate at least 80% of the 'classic' science fiction books being offered right now in Kindle editions are copyright infringements. Most of them contain no copyright statement of any kind or a statement they have been published with permission. The fact that Amazon does not seem bothered by this is a scandal.If you want to see how widespread the problem is, just run a search in the Kindle Bookstore for \"Phillip K. Dick\" -- all those Kindle editions, and almost none of them reprinted with permission. Does Anyone seriously believe the copyrights on all these works by Phillip K. Dick have 'expired'? Yeah, sure, that's why Hollywood producers pay Dick's estate millions of dollars for the rights to make films from them.",
            "I liked the beginning of this book. I was hoping for another Alas Babylon or Earth Abides. Nope. I never really believed it, not a word.

Yawn.Let's look inside this far future abandoned city to see what lurks there. NOTHING lurks there.Lets meet the menacing aliens and see what happens. NOTHING happens.

            "I can appreciate that the writer broke ground in writing one of the first future-war novel, but I just could not get into the story. With much pulp fiction written during the time that this was, the work either has good character development or it doesn't. For me that was the case with FINAL BLACKOUT. It was entertaining enough, but I have read better books. I am reading FEAR by the same writer; that book is better.",
            "I think that L. Ron Hubbard is an amazing author. Battlefield Earth is the greatest science fiction novel I have read. The Mission Earth series was a great read. Hubbards command of the english language and the cadence of his storytelling is that of a master. It is too bad that so many people seem to avoid his work due to Dianetics and Scientology.Final Blackout was written nearly 40 years before Battlefield Earth. His growth as an author during those years was painfully apparant after reading Final Blackout. His description of events and depth of character are scattered and weak, and I often felt lost in the stories path. I can see some early examples of his style that become perfected in his later works, but in this novel it really didn't quite work and I was disappointed.",
            "This is a pulp fiction, sci-fi novel. Kind of comic book stuff, which makes it an easy read. There is no suspense, clever plots, internal dialogues or character development.I liked the book for its simplicity and concept of a post World War II. After years of fighting, Europe is covered with roving bands of soldiers, who take food and weapons wherever they travel. They eventually re-conquer England and set up a prosperous and fair government. After a few years, their peace is disrupted by an invading force from the U.S.A. under the pretense that they violated some international law. (This is really Deja vu regarding the Middle East and several of the U.N. Peace Keeping \"Humanitarian\" missions.)While Peace Keeping, in Croatia, (former Yugoslavia) I heard reports of the same roving kind of private army bands, pillaging across the country. So, this scenario is very possible. Any history buff or soldier can also relate to concepts of the \"field soldiers/officers\" and the lazy, self-serving bureaucrats that make up \"the brass.\"While this is not great book, it is thought-provoking to what could have happened in Europe or Asia, if the west had not intervened.Doug Setter, author ofOne Less Victim: A Prevention GuideandStomach Flattening",
            "It seems that every time I find one of Hubbard's fiction books they're full of blurbs from famous authors praising them. \"Fear\" was called a \"classic\" by Stephen King and the Galaxy edition of \"Final Blackout\" has a long introduction by Algis Budrys saying how great the book is. Somehow the books never seem to be able to live up to their hype. One exception may be \"Battlefield Earth\", which I really liked.Anyway, \"Final Blackout\" was written in 1940, and its set in the future, the Second World War having never ended. \"The Lieutenant\" leads his soldiers in battle, exiled from his native Britain, and when they get to the headquarters somewhere in France, military bureaucrats takes his troops away from him. But his soldiers stand by him and they invade Britain, which has been taken overy by communists.It starts out with rather tedious battle scenes, gets better somewhere in the middle, then more battle scenes. Then there are some political ideas I found rather questionable, and a \"clever\" ending.There are some similarities with \"Battlefield Earth\", but \"Final Blackout\" never gets anywhere near as good as that novel. It's a quick read. Will be interesting for Hubbard fans but most readers needn't bother.",
            "I have read many many books over the years and have found that the type of book I like best is one that entertains and teaches without preaching._Final Blackout_ is such a book. The protaganist (known as The Lieutenant) teaches us a real lesson in integrity while the story is set in a classic Science Fiction manner &quot;after the war.&quot;The auhor's style is extremely easy to read and displays the ultimate test of good writing -- when I was done reading the book, I found myself wondering how the sequel could have been written.I think you'll like this one ...",
            "Recieved in less time than was told it would take. Brand new and excellent price.",
            "When you consider that this was one of the first things that L. Ron Hubbard wrote, way back when he was nineteen (I believe); you can't help but be astonished at its intelligence and wisdom. A powerful story, combining elements of science fiction with values and great action; I consider this a must-read.",
            "Hubbard, in this book written BEFORE the end of the Second World War shows what might have been. This book was writen when he was very young and that is shown in the writing style, which is very straightforward and well done. It is relatively short and an excellent read for anyone who enjoys books of the genre by a master of Science fiction.",
            "You know one should be used to the Great Man takes on the system book by now. They are so numerous that they shouldn't even annoy anymore. Yet this book takes it to the extreme. The Lieutenant is the great one, the grand poobah, the rebel leader hero. Everyone else is either a loyal follower or an evil petty bureaucrat. Sadly Hubbard spends many pages reinforcing these thin characterizations.Yes this book was written when he was young and it wasn't meant to endure. Maybe it can be read as a hokey 1940 pulp and a testament to the paranoia of perpetual war. It almost belongs more to the Vietnam era than WWII since all the generals and upper level military guys are selfish fools ready to sacrifice a million lives for their own glory (there's even the American Imperialists at the end) but I doubt the unadulterated praise for the Lieutenant would fly any better in Vietnam War America.Either way it's a dull book full of cliches that would have been long out of print without Scientology.",
            "This is a margainly interesting book about apocalyptic war. Its main attraction being that it is one of the first of the genre. Its worth a read, but its nothing to get excited about. The writing style is a very straightforward unimbelished style charicteristic of the writer.",
            "Okay guys, I regret to say that although I found the morals and certitude of the Leutenant admirable as well (there's a pun in that statement somewhere, I just know it), I found the apparel and demeanor of the character to be laughably amateurish. What with the Leutenant's sullen, tight-lipped, Napoleonic-loner demeanor, coupled with his Shakespearian cape and facially obscuring helmet, along with a psychotic dedication to some obscurely delineated ideal, my overall picture of the man was lamentably reduced to some laughable cardboard stage character that, say, an eight-year old kid might be forced to play in some dippy grammar school play. This sense of the tale coming from some unconscious memory of a dull grammar school play, is also a less than savory element that I also found as an all too pervasive flavor in the story itself. I mean, come on! You've got this taciturn twit wandering around the countryside, wearing a melodramatically long cape, and with the full complement of his merry, mindless, homicidal band of ragtag soldiers. This is almost too rich for the Monte Python crew to chew on as well! All I can say to the late LR Hubbard about this novel is this: &quot;Blow it out your ___, Ronnie Baby! This Leutenant character actually belongs in an institution for delusional buffoons, or retired clowns, take your pick. Certainly not a character anybody should model themselves after, that's for certain.&quot; Cheers!",

            "This is my favorite science fiction book of all time. The Lieutenant is an awesome character - today's leaders could surely learn a thing or two about leadership and honor from him! Great story, well written, suspenseful and makes you think.",
            "\"Final Blackout\" was written in the 1930's, and it is an adventure story written for fascists, by a fascist. Here's the set-up: a world war, started by weak, democratically elected elitists, has been dragging on for decades. A courageous soldier known simply as \"The Lieutenant\" overthrows the corrupt military power structure and takes matters into his own hands. He defeats all challengers and installs himself as a military dictator, bringing peace and prosperity to war-ravaged Britain. This new regime's torture and execution of dissidents is mentioned only in passing -- but I guess you can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs. \"Final Blackout\" is sneeringly contemptuous of democracy, and the character of \"The Senator\" is one of the most ridiculous straw men you will ever find within the pages of a book. This is an interesting relic, but not much more. I don't think Hubbard's defenders ought to be crowing about this one.",
            "I am not a Scientologist, but I do like pulp fiction. FINAL BLACKOUT was an innovative tale for its time, and does a fairly good job standing on its own today. The story's general cynicism towards governments seems rather atypical of the patriotism in pre-WW II America. The characters are interesting, but a little stiff. There is a fair amount of action; the main character's strategies make for interesting reading (although some of the Lieutenant's tactics are a bit of a stretch). Final Blackout's main strength is its &quot;post-apocalyptic&quot; scenario, written well before that genre was synonimous with apes and Mel Gibson. Not the greatest pulp novel ever written, but a good, solid read. Even if you disagree with Hubbard's &quot;religion&quot;, the man could spin a decent yarn.",
            "This is a gripping tale about a man known only as the 'Lieutenant' as he leads a small band of loyal followers in an apolocalyptic world war setting. It portrays the inhumanity of war, and exposes the character of those who create and prolong them. This early Hubbard novel is an expose' on the insanity of war, and deserves it's rightful place in history as classic novel. It should be recommended reading to all, who desire to prevent this kind of future. This one is a great SF classic in the spirit of Hemmingway's 'For Whom the Bell Tolls' and 'A Farewell to Arms'. Read it and enjoy.",
            "Most of us today cannot help but evaluate L. Ron Hubbard without thinking of him in terms of his connection with Dianetics and Scientology. My view of Hubbard in this context is generally negative.But Hubbard wrote a lot of fiction before the days of Dianetics in the early fifties. Much of it was bad, but some of it was quite good. _Final Blackout_ (1948) was first written in 1939 and serialized in _Astounding_ in 1940. In a preface to the 1948 book, Hubbard notes that when he wrote the novel \"there was still a Maginot line, Dunkirk was just another French coastal town and the Battle of Britain, the Bulge, Saipan, Iwo, V2s and Nagasaki were things unknown\" (5). Many gentlemen still wondered \"whether or not it _was_ not possible to do business with Hitler\" (6).Hubbard's novel, written in \"that quiet world of 1939\" (8), generated a lot of controversy, both as a magazine serial and as a book. Hubbard imagines a Europe ravaged by so many wars that almost all traces of civilization have been wiped out. Against this background, a military genius called \"the Lieutenant\"-- he has no name-- bucks his incompetent superior officers and launches a series of campaigns that begin to win the war and unify England with himself as dictator. The country that is considered to be the main villain is not Germany or Russia. Rather, it is a decadent United States of America.The novel is violent and grim, and the scenario of the Benevolent Dictator rescuing Civilization is a bit on the fascist side. (Though the novel goes through the motions of attacking fascism.) But these qualities are consistent with Hubbard's premise of a war-torn continent. And it is to Hubbard's credit that the violence is not sensationalized and the characters are not glorified.Sixty years after the book publication, the faults of the novel are more obvious. The style is competent but pulpish, and its theme is sometimes a little too obvious. It is not as good as some of his early fantasies like _Slaves of Sleep_ (1948) and _Fear_ (1957). But it still has a certain power to it that wears well.",
            "This book in some ways reminds me of Fatherland in the fact that WW2 lasted longer (a great HBO movie btw) It also reminds me that WW 1 would have lasted probably into a good amount of the 1920's if the US hadn't came in. Anyways the book is good...a great description at the beginning of how he was brought up. Also the fact he methodically plays solitare over and over to pass the war. Surprisingly this reminds me of the Vietnam conflict except this was written almost 20 years before Vietnam started.",
            "This book was something I picked out at a bookstore when I was given a gift certificate. Reading it each night before I went to sleep gave me such realistic dreams, that I could actually picture the battlegrounds, massive destruction, and faces of the Lieutenant and his crew. I am not an avid reader, but this book opened the way for me to start the Mission Earth decology which is of an even higher quality. I am presently on book number 4, and loving it. The only book I liked even better than these was &quot;The Contender&quot;, the story of a young, black boxer living in the tri-state area, something I can relate to.",
            "As this book demonstrates, before he turned to Dianetics and founded the religion of Scientology, Hubbard was a pretty good science fiction writer. Originally written in 1940, this book is a dark and prescient tale about a general European war.The setting is decades after the start of the war, it started with the use of high powered weapons of the 1940 era, but after the involvement of atom bombs, biological and chemical agents, the war continues but the quality of the weapons has declined. Airplanes and all other mechanized weapons of war are no longer, along with nearly all of the people. The soldiers continue to fight on, but now a large unit is a few hundred men. They are called the \"unkillables\" because they have managed to survive the biological agents, war and the chronic lack of food. Most of what they eat is the remnants of what was packaged years ago, so nearly everyone is on the edge of starvation. The industrial base is gone and there are few civilians and even fewer pockets of civilization.The lieutenant commands a small British unit that has been in constant warfare on the European mainland for years. Since they are infected with a biological agent, they are forbidden to return to England. The lieutenant is an extremely skilled commander, so as they move around the countryside they easily defeat any opposition they encounter.Eventually, they come across a unit commanded by British political generals, sent by the British Communist Party, now ruling Britain, to make contact with all remaining British units. The goal of the generals is to strip these units of their distinctive structure and incorporate them into a political fighting force. However, since the generals are militarily incompetent, it is easy for the lieutenant and his unit to defeat them and take over the command. Knowing that it is now biologically safe to do so, the lieutenant and his forces return to England.Hubbard demonstrates his knowledge of the current status of science and a degree of predictive capability in his use of biological and atomic weapons. However, as dark as the story is, it has an even darker ending, for despite all of the death and destruction; as soon as it is possible, imperialism arises once more in a terrible but predictable way.",
            "The &#34;Lieutenant&#34; is one of my favorite characters of all time, as a great example of leadership before and during combat. When you read biographies of the great generals of modern times I am always struck by how much of their work is done before the battle ever starts. Patton's biography is just full of that. The battle of the bulge was a miracle of the leadership in pre-planning, not frantic mid-battle decisions.A great leader inspires confidence by his calm handling under stress, while still being fully aware and responding correctly to each change in circumstances.The book also has some great combat sequences- you can really see the strategy and troop movement. Great book.",

            "This book by L.Ron Hubbard is a dark and fairly bleak novel. It endorses the idea of the beneficent dictator, It's style reminded me of the writings of Ayn Rand",
            "I read this book many years ago and have read it over again. It is a great story and is a bit of a warning. Definitely worth a read."

This is a gritty realistic western that is refreshing as the main character actually gets hurt, he isnt immune to bullets like some westerns i've read. He even misses his shots occasionally! The author doesnt use excessive detail on surroundings etc., enough to get his point across. I highly recommend it, as this book is a very realistic portrayal of how the west really was. Not everyone liked everyone, people die, good and bad! If you like happy endings, this isnt exactly the book your looking for. I hope to see more books from Mr. Laing. The main cons about this book was it seemed to end to soon. :-)"

        "description": "Biblical texts create worlds of meaning and invite readers to enter them. When readers enter such textual worlds, which are strange and complex, they are confronted with theological claims. With this in mind, the purpose of the IBT series is to help serious readers in their experience of reading and interpreting by providing guides for their journeys into textual worlds. The focus of the series is not so much on the world behind the text as on the worlds created by the texts in their engagement with readers. Nowhere is the world of the biblical text stranger than in the apocalyptic literature of both the Old and New Testaments. In this volume, Stephen Cook makes the puzzling visions and symbols of the biblical apocalyptic literature intelligible to modern readers. He begins with definitions of apocalypticism and apocalyptic literature and introduces the various scholarly approaches to and issues for our understanding of the text. Cook introduces the reader to the social and historical worlds of the apocalyptic groups that gave rise to such literature and leads the reader into a better appreciation and understanding of the theological import of biblical apocalyptic literature. In the second major section of the book, Cook guides the reader through specific examples of the Bible\u2019s apocalyptic literature. He addresses both the best-known examples (the biblical books of Daniel and Revelation) and other important but lesser known examples (Zechariah and some words of Jesus and Paul).",

            "Paul S. Minear presents a method for interpreting apocalyptic literature that is both biblically sound and relavant to persons today. Distinguishing this genre from that of prophecy, Dr. Minear explores in detail the forces and events that gave impetus to the apocalyptic movement. He then focuses on eight key texts from Revelation, 1 Peter, Romans, and Hebrews, and shows how the apocalyptic writings can be effectively used in modern teaching and preaching. He discusses the dramatic resurgence of apocalyptic thought in a fascinating overview of the modern charismatic movement.For those students, preachers, and teachers who seek to use this often controversial material in sermons and lessons, Dr. Minear's excellent book makes a most welcome guide. -- from book's back cover"

            "I was very torn when figuring out what to articulate about this book. On one hand, nothing happened, with the highlight being the submarine trip to Seattle. On the other hand, the nothing was somehow interesting. I won't say I walked away invested in the characters, but they were enjoyable enough to watch move about their lives. I agree with other reviews that say the world was very oversimplified -- crime would be rampant and hardly anyone would have any motivation for going to work -- but at the same time, their actions planning for a future they didn't plan to live spoke volumes about the necessity for hope within humans.Overall, worth the read for post-apocalyptic or old science fiction fans who aren't expecting a great deal of action.",
            "Very dark story about the end of human life on earth after a nuclear battle. I saw this as a movie when I was maybe 10 or 12 back in the 60s, when the cold war was raging and everybody was into bomb shelters. Very good cautionary tale.",
            "First, I'd like to mention the condition of the book I purchased. Amazing, as if brand new. Moreover, it was an edition limited to 80 (eighty) copies and I'm sure it has never been read before. The four outside corners (front & back) of the book are protected by a brass leaf ornament. I have been collecting books for 40 years and I have never seen this before. The seller sold me a book which far exceeded any of my expectations. I was just looking for a copy to read, now I have a collector's item. Thanks.Many of us know the story, it is the end of the world and people in a small area of Australia are waiting to die. The book begins with the population expecting to have up to six months remaining before they are poisoned by radioactive illness. Do they sit around and wait to die? Are they in denial? Do they do that one last thing in life that they always wanted to do? Do they drink themselves to death before the illness strikes? What if the timing of the death cloud changes and they only have three months to live? The book follows four or five main characters and we are the observers of their destinies.A very good read. Interesting and compelling. Since the book was first released in 1957 it has remained timely and something we should all consider. What would we do? How prepared are we for a death that we know is coming? More than just a story of a nuclear holocaust, there is a very strong philosophic subtext within the story.If you haven't already done so, READ THIS BOOK!",
            "This book, even though it was written in the 1950's resounds today with the world in turmoil. Set in Australia in the early 1960's after a devestating nuclear war wipes out the populations of the Northern Hemisphere with radiation being carried by wind currents and ocean currents to the Southern Hemisphere and giving Australians less than six months left to live; it shows what people can (or sometimes doesn't do) when they don't have long to live. I recommend this book to serve as a warning as to what happens when nations don't try to find peaceful solutions to problems and to prepare for if the worse happens.",
            "This is a strange and morbid tale - but it hits home for those of us who grew up in an era when we really did fear and expect a nuclear holocaust (hopefully that fear and those days never come again?). Here we don't have the cataclysmic descent into the horrors of The Road - instead, as the story progresses and each dim hope of survival sadly evaporates, there is a resigned acceptance as to the end of all human life at a known (and rapidly approaching) date. We follow the characters through their different ways of coping with this fate and supporting each other to the end - while some strange but plausible behaviours and events unfold. Depressing? Certainly. Nevertheless it does reflect the world when it stood on the brink of destruction in the late 50s and early 60s. It wasn't all rock and roll - there was a very dark side to life at that time too. Let's not go back there ...",
            "This book is excellent! I am amazed that it was written in 1957 because it seems so realistic. After reading it I was left with alot to think about - not always true of books I read. I would recommend On The Beach to everyone.",
            "An interesting insight into how Australian society was perceived during that time period, the threat of nuclear devastation, and how people react in particularly difficult and unique circumstances. This novel made me think on so many different levels and question how I would handle the same or similar situations.",
            "Nevil Shute's On the Beach is a post-apocalyptic novel written in 1957 but set in 1963. The worst has already occurred. The majority of human life has been destroyed by nuclear warfare before the narrative begins. Only people living in the farthest reaches of the the southern hemisphere remain alive. They too will all be dead in a matter of months as the unstoppable cloud of deadly radiation ultimately covers the entire planet.The novel features a number of Australian characters as well as an American submarine captain. As doomsday approaches, their lives are touchingly described. On the Beach contains some interesting scenarios and there are many moments of poignancy especially in the final pages.Much of the narrative contains accounts of everyday life as the characters strive to go about their business as if the end weren't just around the corner. Since everyday life isn't all that exciting, these portions of the book may be seen as rather dull. It's just very hard to write about the mundaneness of day to day existence without being a little bit boring.All in all, an interesting and thought provoking take on the doomsday novel. Haunting in its simplicity.",
            "This was a very special request for my Dad who passed away a few years ago. It is his favorite novel and his own was very ragged and falling apart is why I bought this for him. This arrived in a plastic bag and was found to be in fair condition.The spine was a little stretched but seemed to be holding up fairly well.I understand this is a very old science fiction story so that could lead up to why the book itself was old and worn.",
            "Nevil Shute's \"On the Beach\" is a classic book of a world on the brink of nuclear destruction. The story is still completely relevant today (decades after it was written), and it allows the viewer to note the societal differences between today and the culture of the 1950s.",
            "I really enjoyed this book even though it started out pretty slow. As you get into the book it shows a struggle to escape the fallout and survive. Eventually everyone has to accept their fate that their shortened lives will come to an end, including Dwight and Moira. This book kept me interested to keep reading until I came to the end which I knew was inevitable and sad.",
            "This is not a post-nuclear adventure book-- nothing here for Mad Max or giant mutant rat fans. It is not even an up-to-date reading of what post-nuclear earth would look like; much more recent scientific speculation contradicts some of the picture here.But it does give you what Shute does best-- ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. What would you do if you knew that you, and every other human around you, were about to relentlessly, unavoidably, painfully die? This is a powerful haunting hopeless book, but for my money the most realistically frightening picture of the end of human life ever set on the page.",
            "I read this book many years ago and was reminded of it recently. While it was written during the cold war and some of the characters might seem dated it is as relevant today as it was when it was written. It is a compassionate credible story of the end of the world. It should be mandatory reading for every politician and every person so that the apocalyptic vision portrayed in this book never comes to pass.",
            "Some of the science in the book is not valid, but if you remember how long ago it was written, it can be overlooked. Besides that, though, the book is very interesting. It succeeds in being sad and frightening. I enjoyed reading it. If you want a happy ending, this is not your book.",
            "On the beach is a novel set in the late 1950's about the end of humanity following a nuclear war. This type of story always brings to mind horrible tales of mutant and roving gangs of looter. That is were this book differs from most shock tales of it's kind. Simply put, it's the story of the last survivors of a nuclear war as of yet untouch by the devistation, waiting for the deadly radioactive fallout. To the end they try to put thier affairs in order, prepare for thier fate and maintain thier dignity and humanity.",
            "I am re-reading this book and had to put it down. Everytime I read this book I end up in tears from the pain. It isn't a book that you can't put down because you have to put it down. It is far to powerful to take in all at once. You are left instantly without hope, yet despite that he causes you to hope beyond hope. As well as being an excellent read it carries a powerful and important message that this world may too easily become our own.",
            "Shute makes his depiction of daily life after a nuclear holocaust (in our current back yard) clear and compelling. A must read for all levels of reader.",
            "I know a book is good when I come to the end of it and I can't rid myself of certain feelings the author is trying to convey to me through the characters. For example, when I read the Grapes of Wrath I felt tired and hungry like the characters in the book! After reading On the Beach I felt the horror the characters felt knowing the world was coming to an end. I have re-read this book several times and would recommend it to anyone. Shute is an exceptional storyteller.",
            "&quot;On the Beach&quot; has haunted my nights and my days since I read it. The war that caused Nevil Shute's nuclear holocaust began in Albania, a fact not lost on readers today. It should be required reading not only for all students, but for all politicians.",
            "I first read this book after my friend sugested it. I was reluctent at first but was soon caught up in the tail.as the story gets nearer and nearer to the end you start to realize that there is no way of getting out of it. the carecters are domed. shutes book makes that a reality.This was an exillent book.",
            "This book was one of the worst books I've read. Actually I couldn't finish it. It was very slow and there was no action. Not what I was looking for in this type of book. I left it on the last plane because I didn't want to waste the space in my bag.",
            "This book had the most BS I have ever read. Cobalt bombs only exist on paper. Frankly, I think it is wholly unrealistic and dangerous for it turns people away from civil defense measures which could save their lives. Mr. Shute was a great writer of fiction, but this book, as far as realism is concerned, completely missed the bullseye.",
            "This book is such a bore! I took the book on a 5-hour flight, looking forward to be entertained. I threw it in the trash on arrival, after painstakingly reading my way through it... since I had only one book! It has been written a few decades ago and it really shows. Most of the book is spent describing the nascent love between a submarine captain and a young Australian sassy airhead drunkard, through frivolous 2-cents dialogs they have in bars and parties. Half of the rest describes Australian social life. The other half recounts how the war happenned. No adventure, no action, no thrill, no discovery, no exploration, no mystery... Nothing... Certainly not the book I ll take on desert island or in an anti-atomic shelter!",
            "This book was horrible and boring. I was very disapointed in the aweful writing and sexist comments coming up often while i was reading the book. I do not recommend this book to anyone. It is one of the worst books i have ever read. ...",
            "This book was absolutly bad, bad, &amp; bad. I would recomend this book to NOBODY. This book was the biggest waste of time! Don't even bother!",
            "This book was very intertaining. It is one of the few books that kills off ALL the main characters(and minor ones) and is still good. This book would be good to read for anyone who is interested in how things were during the Cold War.",
            "This is an astonishing book; somehow it rings just as true today as it must have when it first came out in the late fifties.I have read it a number of times, and each time I find myself praying that it will turn out differently for the people in the story.This is a MUST READ!",
            "I was amazed by the quality of this novel. Though I never really care for science fiction. I was impressed by the validity of Shute's nuclear war. It is explained subtly and you get a chill realizing in fact that if it was going to happen this is exactly what it would be like. For a few bucks and a quiet evening you can't beat this book!",
            "I just finished this novel several minutes ago and am completely shocked. It's not very often a book or movie can make me cry, but this did it for me. It's nothing like the 'disaster' stories of recent years, which have very little in charactization. Instead, this novel focuses on the last few months in the lives of the characters, which are well-presented and realistic. The scary thing is, the scenario presented in this novel is quite real and could happen at any moment, and almost did on several past occasions: a full-scale world nuclear war. This is a must read for anyone.",
            "When it is considered that this book was published in 1957, its meaning takes on added significance. At that time there was no ban on atmoshperic testing of nuclear weapons. Radiation actually did circle the globe when large nucelar weapons were exploded. Those families who could afford it really were building fallout shelters.It was a chilling time and this novel may well have helped the world's leaders get the prespective needed to move on toward a nuclear test ban treaty. It could have given them a sober dose of sanity that ultimately led to rational co-existence between East and West.While I agree that the writing at times is slow, the complaint from another reader about gender treatment is annoying. The young mother's sentimentality underscores the tragedy of a nuclear holcaust. The romatic angle with Towers and Davidson reconciles the the straight-laced with the foot-loose during the final moments of truth.I also found it interesting to note that the author was a successful aeronautical engineer as well as a novelist.",
            "\"On the Beach\" follows a US submarine captain who's found his way to Australia after an all-out nuclear war has decimated the northern hemisphere. Global winds slowly carry the deadly radiactive waste towards the Australian Continent and people there come to terms with their impending death by undertaking various hobbies such as race car driving and gardening.I give it only two stars. One of the most disappointing aspects of the story is that no one TRIES to survive. No one builds a radiation-proof shelter, stores food or does anything to extend their life even one single day. Every character in the book just accepts their impending deaths as an inescapable certainty.The will to survive is imbedded in our genes. Our adaptability and ingenuity have carried us through the last 50,000 years as a species. Accepting the end of mankind, as one might accept a dull, rainy day misses the point and promise of post-apocalyptic literature. Instead of the will to survive, we are shown a pathetic, poorly-imagined end to humanity. \"On the Beach\" fails to inspire or entertain.",
            "I fancied myself well-read. I also thought I had felt it all and conquered it all. But when my English teacher made me read this book, my universe was ripped into two pieces and forced down my throat in a way that hurt. I had to stop and look at what I held dear, how fragile it all really is, and my own mortality that I thought I'd accepted. It's impossible for me not to admire the characters in this book: facing their deaths, agonizingly slow in coming, with as much dignity as each individual could muster. Dashed hopes, dreams cut short, beauty that was never to be...innocent victims, and nothing left in the end but the waves sighing along the rocky shores of a nation that was nothing but a Dreamland to me before. Thank God something opened my eyes before I let them be closed by my own ridiculous faith in my own ability to fight and win invariably.",
            "I bought this book after reading: \"The most shocking fiction I have read in years. What is shocking about it is both the idea and the sheer imaginative brilliance with which Mr. Shute brings it off.\" --San Francisco Chronicle\"The most haunting evocation we have of a world dying of radiation after an atomic war.\" --The New York TimesSeriously? Whoever is at the Chronicle and the Times needs to be fired. The book paints a picture of a world decimated by the after effects of a nuclear war. Yet what does the remaining population do? Prepare? Try to survive? Hell no. Calmly wander around in blithe denial of what is coming.Is there mass hysteria? Is there the unraveling of the fabric of society? Hardly. As this book would have you believe, the remaining population has resigned itself to denial. The most that society has degraded to is drunks passed out on the street and nobody caring.I suppose I should be easier on the writer, this was penned back in the 60's, and for all it's unbelievability, it was a good read and I did enjoy myself.Haunting? Hardly. I couldn't help feeling like radiation death was nothing more than something the characters in the books would say \"Tut Tut, Cheerio. Time to die old man.\" Puke/Crap/Puke/Death. But, that's just my opinion.",
            "One of the most uplifting books I've ever read: belongs on the same shelf with \"Jonathan Livingston Seagull,\" \"Siddhartha,\" and \"The Prophet.\"I was really at a low point in my life when I read this. But, miraculously, this book put a spring in my step and got me right back on track.Guaranteed to dispel even the blackest mood. This is a book to read just after you've been divorced, you've been paralyzed, your children have died, etc.Truly inspirational!",
            "No giant rat creatures or bands of ugly-chic warriors. No heroic action sequences. No great battles for humanity.Just the end of hope, the end of the future, the end of life. This is a depiction, stark and realistic and unromantic, of how humans deal with the knowledge that the end of life on Earth has come, that they are going to die and leave nothing behind.Quite possibly the most depressing post-apocalyptic work of them all, but a real tour de force. A vivid work that stays with you long after you've finished.",
            "Years ago I saw On The Beach on TV. It was a good movie but not a great movie. Worth seeing. I wondered how the book would compare.In 1957 at the height of the cold war between the USSR and USA, while both countries stockpiled thousands of megatons of nuclear weapons, Nevil Shute wrote a classic novel about the end of the world after a major nuclear war. Basically the small country of Albania started the nuclear war. China and the USSR exchange nuclear devastation. One plane gets through and knocks out a US city another 2 planes bomb England. The USA retaliates and launches a massive strike against the USSR who did not bomb the US. The USSR retaliates with a massive strike against the USA. Over 4000 North Hemisphere detonations.The innocent Southern Hemisphere did nothing and does not get Nuclear strikes. All human life and most animal life in the Northern Hemisphere is killed by radiation.We see a US Submarine crew in Australia and Australians awaiting the slow drifting of nuclear fallout and death to all coming into the Southern Hemisphere. I wont ruin it for you by telling too much of the story.Parts of the book were poor...like calling baby Jennifer \"it\" who is dying of radiation poisoning.Lots of red suicide pills given out. The last Grand Prix auto race in Australia is won by a scientist who monitors radiation from the last US submarine. He wins driving a Ferrari he got for next to nothing as its the end of the world.There are really great parts to the book and it is well worth reading. This is a historic 1957 classic sci fi end of the world book. . There are lots of great parts like the race car and the submarine crew finding what is causing a CW transmission in dead Seattle.I found the book kind of depressing. The reader wants to help these people escape approaching death. Death for all is inevitable. There is no escape for anyone. Nevil Shute had the main characters leading a semi normal life to the bitter end. The vast majority of the people did not behave crazy with rape, robbery and mayhem. Of course there is some but the majority of people just wanted to spend their last days with their families and loved ones. Basically Australia went out with a whimper.Just remember that this is still possible. Some little county like North Korea or later Iran could start a nuclear war that gets out of control. We may not have to worry about \"Nuclear Winter\". The nuclear fallout in the stratosphere could be spread worldwide and if the half life of a cobalt bomb is 5 years we probably could not escape radiation poisoning worldwide from 4000 plus H bombs going off. A frighting book. Read non fiction The Cold and The Dark by Paul R Ehrlich ,Carl Sagan, Donald Kennedy and Walter Orr Roberts about the non survival after a global major nuclear war. An even more chilling \"true\" book. There would be no long term survival for mankind. Nevil Shute hit it right on in 1957.On The Beach a good book, with a strong story where the reader develops much empathy and sorrow for the dieing characters. Would of given On The Beach 5 stars but it is depressing and I didn't like dying baby Jennifer called \"it\". Gets you to thinking... this could really happen to us in this crazy world. I pray for peace before its too late. 4 stars and recommended.",
            "I read this book over 10 years ago and it is still one of the few books that I can honestly say left a mark on me. I remember finishing it in my english class and bawling my eyes out. I would highly recommend this book.",
            "First, the bad news. Both the dialogue and--albeit to a lesser extent--the depth of emotion is a bit stilted. Shute often finds himself relying on the same descriptive words or phrases, sometimes in adjoining paragraphs, no less. In my opinion, this prevents the characters from ever becoming truly three-dimensional, though others may disagree. Also, the language used by one of the protagonists, Commander Dwight Towers, is firmly rooted in the fifties, and becomes monotonous after a while.Having said that, what I admire about this book is the relatively matter-of-fact way in which Shute presents the material. What distinguishes this book from others of its ilk is the lack of any legitimate hope for survival or a happy ending. By making the characters' fate clear from the beginning, Shute frees himself to deal with elements that usually go unadressed in &#34;disaster literature&#34;--the effect of that fate on the players' everyday lives. In fact, Shute goes so far in the direction of incorporating the inevitable outcome into everyday existence that, on more than one occasion, I wanted to grab the characters by the lapels and shake them into reality.On balance, this is a recommended read if for no other reason than for its uniqueness in the way in which it deals with the subject.",
            "Had been looking for this book for quite some time, without knowing a lot about it, other than the most basic description of the plot. Found it to be a page-turner, and finished the whole thing in two days. Like others have said, it's very emotional and I cried like a baby, which I don't think I ever have before with a book, which says something. Excellent warning of what could be, without being overly preachy, and harrowing to read. Highly recommended!",
            "The transition from night to day begins each morning with a gentle sunrise insidiously piercing through the unwilling blanket of darkness. Eventually the colossal battle becomes fruitless and night gives in to the increasingly unrelenting pressure of sunshine. In relatively little time the seemingly insignificant temperature rise becomes substantial, creeping its way into life, permeating throughout all that doesn't wilt before the sun's potency. The changes are both irrevocable an inevitable.The atrocities and horrors of war, specifically the aftermath, are just as apparent as that sunrise. Similarly, the nuclear fallout and resulting widespread death is agonizingly slow.On the Beach is a tale of the realistic horror that could eventually destroy our planet. For those near the epicenters of full scale nuclear war, death is painless and instant. Those not fortunate enough to suffer a sweet, immediate death, face the realization that death approaches at a snail's pace. As the poison of radiation drifts across the ocean southward towards Australia, a U.S. submarine commander named Dwight Towers has to carry on with his mission, and make sense of the world's military actions.Dwight meets Moira Davidson, a frisky Australian girl with a wild streak, and along with their married friends Peter and Mary, they go about the gut-wrenching final days of their lives. Dwight holds on to the memory of his life, seeking solace in moderate denial, buying gifts for his wife and children who have no doubt already succumbed to the poisonous radiation. Similarly, Peter and Mary plan a garden for future seasons they will never see. Meanwhile, Moira faces death with a slight chip on her shoulder, and a scowl at what could have been. Eventually the four find a dichotomous comfort in knowing that they have no recourse for survival, living their final days with as much vigor, generosity, and soft smiles as possible.The real strength of this novel is the character development. By learning about the characters' lives and insecurities, strengths and flaws, as well as their likes and dislikes, a great deal of empathy is elicited. Following their depressingly mundane last days during humanity's failing health and infrastructure sheds light on that which we all take for granted, like the simple pleasures and beauty that can be gained from a good drink, an exhilarating race, or a relaxing day fishing.Humanity should hope that nothing remotely similar to this novel actually occurs. And, even though I'm sure there would be considerably more chaos than represented in the characters' dignified approach, the slow, somber story development accentuates the truly dreary prospect of a slow helpless death.",
            "It's impossible to say that I enjoyed this book. How can one enjoy a book about the end of humanity? Most of the people in the world are already dead when the book begins and those remaining in southernmost Australia, South America and South Africa are just waiting for the inevitable fallout to get to them. They know it is coming and there is nothing they can do about it. This is the depressing part. The upbeat part, if you can really call it that, is the way the inhabitants of Melbourne go on with their lives - working at jobs that really don't matter anymore, planting gardens they will never be able to harvest, building fences to keep in livestock that will soon be gone, going to school to learn skills they will never be able to use, etc. They don't just roll over and play dead. They don't go looting all the stores and stealing everything. If fact, merchants more often than not just let people have what they need without payment at all. To me the best part of this book is the grace with which most of the people accepted their fate. Though I still like 'Alas Babylon' better, this is a very good book too.",
            "Other reviews give a synopsis, so I'll skip that and go straight to an analysis/critique.I first read Nevil Shute's On the Beach when I was a teenager--about the same time as I read Pat Frank's Alas, Babylon--and I've retained a morbid fascination with it ever since. As science fiction it's not all that great, since it isn't really SF at all. Instead, it is more of an allegory with a heavy touch of absurdism thrown in. Think about it: the denizens of a functioning civilization go about their business with near-normality, behaving one minute as if everything is fine while in the next acknowledging (usually with a large degree of detachment) that a sword is hanging over their heads. This description fits both the book and the actual nuclear/Cold War world of the late 1950s. The only difference is that in the book the blade is already, and inescapably, whistling downwards, while in the real world (and this is Shute's point) the danger might be avoided, if people act right away.Indeed, Shute goes to great pains to get his original readers to identify with the characters and civilization in On the Beach. The Australian setting is accessible to the English speaker, as a South American or African setting wouldn't be. Aside from the gasoline shortage, which he mentions cursorily on occasion, the characters seem discommoded almost not at all by the war (Moira has to darn Dwight's socks; Dwight has to drink Australian whiskey), and Shute greatly downplays even the travel problems, making them seem only a modest inconvenience. Government and the market both appear to function normally, only beginning to falter a bit at the very end. In fact, most people behave even in the final days as if everything were going to continue. A clerk insists on giving Peter Holmes a receipt for a purchase even though the store is about to shut down; the admiral discusses in some detail the reimbursement procedure that an admittedly-nuked Washington, D.C. will follow for the Australian upkeep of the U.S. submarine even as radiation sickness forces him to bolt for the bathroom. These people know the end of the world is days, even hours, away; they aren't deluding themselves; but still, they can't let go. This fabric of functionality and forced normality makes the world of On the Beach resonate with the real Cold War world: in each the danger, while quite real, is remote from everyday circumstance, leading to an almost schizophrenic existence. (Think \"Duck and Cover\" commercials airing during a \"Leave it to Beaver\" episode and you get the idea.)The characters' ultimate, and universal, reaction to the approaching end of the world further strengthen the allegorical nature of the book. British apocalyptic fiction has always been more fatalistic and pessimistic than its American counterpart, and in no case is this more true than in On the Beach, which is perhaps the most devastating work of its kind. Shute's post-holocaust characters--in fact the entire civilization--simply give up. From an American perspective--the sort that produced the contemporary Alas, Babylon--this is frustrating and unrealistic. To paraphrase a statement of Colonel Graff in another famous American SF work, Ender's Game, our genetic heritage simply doesn't allow us to give up without a fight. But that's exactly what Shute's world does, without even any show of resistance. In the entire book there are only two, or perhaps three, real outbursts of emotional reaction to what's happening. No drastic mobilization to prepare a bunker to wait out the twenty year period of radiation, no desperate attempt to continue the species at any and all cost, as in When Worlds Collide (\"Waste anything but time!\"); just passive acquiescence and, in the end, mass suicide. This fact--this long, drawn-out, and ultimate loss of hope, which few other works can match--is what makes the book so important. In sum, Shute asked the Cold War reader how s/he will respond to a threat that, unlike the one in On the Beach, was still only potential. Peter Holmes, in his deathbed speech, suggests education. The book's meaning and purpose is best summed up in the closing shot of the original film; the banner proclaiming to an empty Melbourne \"There is still time, brother.\"On a literary level the book leaves much to be desired. Particularly grating to this American is the terribly contrived American dialect of Dwight Towers, the American sub commander. But despite this, On the Beach is a classic of the genre--if you can stomach it.",
            "As a child of the 50s and 60s, I found the book very credible.The most powerful thing in this novel is its immediacy to our own lives.We exist in an age when nuclear warfare is an immediate possibility.I was touched by the captain's insistence on thinking of his family in the present tense, and refusal of the woman, Moira's advances, in deference to his obviously married state (despite his awareness of the reality, the captain continues to think of them as he left them).As a person who, as a child in the 60s, learned to jump under my desk in school, during air-raid drills, I was profoundly affected by this story.Furthermore, I was very moved by this author's vision of how people might hold on to hope, at the same time that they accept, on various levels, the inevitability of destruction.I have read thousands of books in my lifetime, most of which I recall only slightly. I will never forget this book.",
            "The beach, when one beholds it as such, is the end of the world.Nevil Shute's incredible novel is not about surviving a global nuclear holocaust. The reader will follow the lives of several people, some of whom are related, some who are friends, and some who have been brought to Australia by inevitability. One of these strangers, Dwight Towers, is an American commander for the U.S. Navy who oversees a vital submarine mission to the United States' western shores. And there the servicemen will observe, on the beach, the unsettling lack of human life.When not commissioned, Lieutenant Commander Peter Holmes lives with his brand new family, Mary and his young baby Jennifer. There they spend their days living in labored bliss, on the beach, and frequently visited by family friend Moira Davidson, a young blonde in her 20s whose hobby was once gin, but is now brandy. She consumes more liquor than even Alistair MacLean can wave an empty glass at. Though her disposition is one of genuineness, she begins enticing the submarine captain Dwight into falling in love with her. By the end of the tale, Moira becomes the most beautiful and haunted character and her faithfulness and loyalty brought me to tears more so than any other character.Shute's novel frightened me. We are, all of us, led to believe that much of Fate is in our own hands. Every day we make decisions that affect the rest of our lives, and this we do not need to be reminded of. What we forget, however, is how fragile and ephemeral our lives are, and at any given moment, our lives are not necessarily in the hands of God, but very possibly in the hands of other human beings. It is worthwhile to remember, lest we forget, that all humans err.It is only at the very end of the book that some of the characters, who have been living a life restrained, must finally accept the truth. Peter states, \"[I]f a couple of hundred million people all decide that their national honour requires them to drop cobalt bombs upon their neighbour, well, there's not much that you or I can do about it\" (229). The small matter of pride is what tears marriages and friendships apart. Unfortunately, it can also destroy the world.It is so subtle, it is easy to overlook, but Shute's motif with beaches pervades the story and ultimately becomes the one thing that never changes.I read the 1963 Signet edition. My dictionary dash consisted of \"sedulously\" (31).",
            "A great, simple book very well written and poignant. What's interesting about it is that as we enter the story, the nuclear war that will eventually doom the characters in the story has already occurred and is over. They are simply awaiting the lethal radioactive cloud to move down to the southern hemisphere and begin to kill everyone off. The people carry on their daily lives as if nothing has happened. But we see in several key scenes early in the book how painfully, heartbreakingly aware they really are. And that's the key power to the story. These people know they're doomed but what choice do they have except to continue on with their lives. The most painful scene I found in the book was how the young couple with the baby begin to plan out their garden for the next year knowing full well that they are not going to be around to see it. They're fooling themselves, obviously, but how else to cope with the inevitable.In the end, the book has the same effect as a movie called &quot;Testament&quot; with Jane Alexander. You'll be depressed and feeling a little scared and hopeless.This is not light reading.",
            "Nothing much happens in the way of action in &quot;On the Beach.&quot; The bombs have already dropped and the human survivors are mearly waiting for the end. As a reader, you know they are all going to die, which makes them even more compelling. This is apocalypse fistion at its finest. Shute doesn't cop out and give the story an artificial happy ending. I first read this book while in high school nearly two decades ago and the ending still haunts me.",
            "This is a poor effort by a very good writer. Leaving &quot;On the Beach&quot; to one side, Nevil Shute is a writer who does a tradesman-like job, and can normally be counted on for a good story with an interesting background to it. This book must have been suggested to him by his publisher or something of the kind. Perhaps he was obliged to write it, for some contractual reason or other. It does not even come close to his other books, some of which are minor classics of mid-twentieth century literature (although usually disdained by the intelligentsia as not being literature of any kind).I suppose the subject matter is such that the book is worth reading anyway. If you are willing to fumble and stumble along with the ups and downs of the writing, the story is not, historically, without interest. Yet I don't think many readers will be terribly convinced by the poor plot and simplistic characters. It's a facile book that I can't imagine Shute himself being very proud of, in spite of its relative success (due no doubt, to the film).",
            "I read this about 45 years ago. I was in my late teens. At the time, I thought it was extremely profound. I read it a couple of weeks ago, I'm now 63. I now regard it as so so. The characters were unbelievable. with a years warning they did nothing to prepare for the survival of the species.John Beyerlein 23 Nov 2010Liz & Dick",
            "Nevil Shute started out writing this novel working backwards, knowing what ending he would have, the end if humanity (which you know if read any of the other reviews here), then decided to emphasis that by making it as mournful and utterly morose as possible, then fit the events of the story to them, so it's almost laughable to consider that this is how reality could have played out when it's Shute pulling the puppet strings on the characters to achieve his desired ending the way he wanted to achieve it.Written during the cold war of the 50's, this novel was supposed to highlight the futility of nuclear war. So this was supposed to let those that somehow didn't understand the power of nuclear weapons, that the Soviets, and others, now have the bomb (which they obtained from American citizen spies working with nuclear secrets) and that nuclear war was un-winnable. Now highlighting the horrors of nuclear war and the hideous death toll it would incur on people, let alone the threat to the human race is commendable, but it's the general philosophy of the book that, OK, there are two or three superpowers that have nuclear weapons, making them equal in cruelty, democracy, and liberty so that's it, no point in having a nuclear weapons and that absolutely nothing justifies their use in any way whatsoever. It sidesteps the reality that one of these superpowers, the Soviets, murdered 20 million people, put countless numbers into labor camps, and was an completely oppressive totalitarian society. Put it another way, consider if the novel had the Nazi's winning WWII, that the Nazi's had nuclear weapons and were continuing the huge murders of people, sending people into labor camps, and repressing democracy, would you then have such qualms on the US having a stockpile of nuclear weapons as a deterrant? Would you then think, as the characters in this novel do, that ah well, we all did this to ourselves and thus deserve this outcome? If you answer differently they maybe you should brush up on history. Sure enough one totalitarian society is marketed as more evil by popular culture, but that doesn't change the history books documentation of the horrors by both the Soviets and the Nazi's. One questions if the author would have written the ending different if it had been a nuclear war with the Nazi's as the survivors \"remarkably\" fighting for humanity and for the future of mankind rather than accepting going out with a whimper.From reading the other reviews there are two types of basic readers that would find this novel of interest: those that would use it as a political manuscript of how humanity ended (although we're still here) and those that have gone through some traumatic experience in their life. For everyone else, sure you can find something appealing in the story, but it's dated, just reading the first page of the poem by T.S. Eliot gives you the theme, and in this day and age it's just average. If you're an average working person you have a job, busy, have friends, maybe family, and have to parcel your time that you invest in reading a book. You don't have to read this. End of the world novel's are quite compelling, and there's many of them, and more to date, out there. If you want an end of the world novel written around the same time, George R. Stewart's end of the world Earth Abides was a more interesting read, and I would recommend that over this novel.",
            "The mystery of the broadcast from no-man's-land is solved by page 174. That leaves about 110 more pages of melodramatic romance and a a somewhat shallow description of how the people end their lives as the inevitable radiation poisoning takes hold. I would have liked more treatment of submarine operations--one of the cruises only takes about two pages. If you're looking for a maritime mystery story this isn't it. The romantical treatment of the young family might be a culture difference--Shute repeatedly refers to the infant as \"it.\"There are some continuity problems, as Shute was evidently unfamiliar with radio terminology despite years developing \"secret weapons for the British in World War II:\" in two facing pages, the frequency of the mysterious transmission is either 4.92 megacycles or 4.92 kilocycles. Similarly, the descriptions of some of the dead (falling out of a latrine, sitting at a year-long cocktail party) are also puzzling given the nearby blasts. More curiously are the dead people in the American town whom the deserted sailor found poisoned in their beds but that in that area death would have been very immediate and not as convenient as the slow, anticipated deaths in Melbourne.I rather disliked the bland story of the scientist-turned-race-car-driver that was seemingly bolted into the book about halfway though. I suppose the author wanted to stuff more pages or perhaps an early reading of his manuscript left out some crucial third-party character.Still, I haven't read a book in three days' time in many years. It's a compelling page-turner, but after page 174 I had a hard time dragging myself through the rest of it.",
            "I purchased this book after being told it was similiar to \"Alas, Babylon\", which I thoroughly enjoyed. However, I found it to be quite different than what I expected. The overall premise was pretty good, but the behaviors of the characters and some scientific elements were just plain off. For example, would people really go on chatting about milk and planting flowers when the whole human race is going extinct? In reality, there would be rioting, price gouging, and so on, but this book implies that life goes on as normal until the very end. I was mildly frustrated with the fact that, with this impending cloud of radiation that's on its way, the government wasn't building massive fallout shelters. Come on, if a submarine could stay underwater and be protected, surely a sealed shelter could be built. Granted, they would need to stock 20 years worth of supplies and house a set number of people, but it is not an unreasonable project to undertake, even for the 1960s.Given all these unrealistic elements, I give this book 3 stars. An alright read, sure, but not very satisfying.",
            "The premise of this book is a fascinating one: How people are living after a world war that took place between the US and China.The stories of each character were explored very well. The gripping part was when the subs search around the Northern Hemispheres for survivors. When they found none, everyone accepted the inevitability that the world would end.It was interesting to read Shute's idea of how the general population would act when they all knew that they were going to die. I think the movie better portrayed the anarchy that was going on around the major cities of Australia.",
            "I think this book just doesn't stand the test of time. It is such a praised classic that I had to buy/read it. Wish I saved my money and got it from the library. If you like \"literature\" this may be for you, if you like to be entertained skip this and read another classic \"Earth Abides\"",
            "Basically I will keep this short and simple for all of you... the story is about basically Russia and the United States going to war and they start using nuclear weapons and soon everyone dies on earth... the book ON THE BEACH then explains what it was like for four survivers who were underwater in a submarine when this takes place come out onto the world and basically what life is like for them. They know the war is taking place so decide to stay underwater and know everyone dies... but they hear a taping noise on the radio... it was an excelent book I enjoyed every chapter of it... and for once I actually liked a book I read for my 11th grade English Class... I recomend it, its idea is great behind it and just a must have",
            "I've read the other reviews. First It is scientifically accurate based on verifitcation from my physicist husband. Second cutting a 120 pages, would leave you with what? Third boring? I read the story in two days, gave up a weekend, and I don't do that anymore. Now, if you read this YOU MUST read Larry Niven's Rainbow Mars collection, particularly the last story, Death in A Cage, which covers this book also. I came upon it surrendipitiously but now I recommend it highly as a great one two punch. Now to On the Beach. I did not know what the storyline was, except my husband recommended it and referred to it often. I was stunned and shocked to find out in Chapter 1 that there had been a Nuclear War started by small powers -- not China, Russia, USA but little one's like Albania in the story or Iraq, now... The spoiled child who if he can't win no one does... I find this plausible. It is well told and romantic -- very romantic and yet...If the bombs get dropped, Shute is right, it goes this way....",
            "This book, written in 1957, has not lost any of its shocking power.It tells the tale of a diverse, doomed group of people in Australia, after a nuclear war leaves them in the only safe place in the world. They know they are to die soon, and how each person copes with the situation is the core of the story.How mankind got to this place in history is also explored, and the quote from T.S. Eliot's \"The Hollow Men\" (used on the title page) is right on the mark:\"In this last of meeting placesWe grope togetherAnd avoid speechGathered on this beach of the tumid river...\"\"This is the way the world ends--This is the way the world ends.This is the way the world endsNot with a bang but a whimper.\"Powerful stuff. A must-read book.",
            "In my opinion, this book is, today, wrongly classified as \"science fiction\". Being written in 1957, and a product of an incipient Cold War, maybe it was science fiction back in the fifties, but now \"On the beach\" is more like \"apocalyptic fiction\".The story is about what could have happened if the northern countries decided to strike nuclear attacks on each other in 1961. Two years later, the whole upper part of the globe has fallen under the radioative cloud, ant there's no one left. Because of the wind patterns, this dooming cloud is slowly reaching southern countries like Brazil, Argentina, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.Dwight Towers is the commander of one of the two remaining submarines existent in the US Navy, now based on Melbourne. There, he meets Moira Davidson, a young alcoholic woman, and her two friends, Australian navy-man Peter Holmes and his wife, Mary, and they have to cope with, literally, the end of the world.\"On the beach\" is not an action book, and it's not about heroic achievements to save what remains of Earth. This is a book of sorrow and regret. Nevil Shute's characters can be divided between those who have accepted their terrible fate, and those who will deny it until the end. That's what is most interesting, and most depressive too.Not a long book, \"On the beach\" seems to drag on for the first three-quarters, only setting a gray but necessary background, but the final chapters are like the water running down the drain in an emptying sink: twisty, fast-paced and hypnotic. Yes, hypnotic is a good word. The reader will keep reading, trying himself to look for ways out, only to discover that sometimes reality is more powerful than imagination.\"On the beach\" is sad all the way. In fact, the title alone is very depressive, once the reader understand its meaning, disclosed on a poem in the first page, and in the very last line. But it is also a powerful reading, one that will stick to the reader's mind after the book is finished. And, after all, this surely could have happened; in fact, Nevil Shute could have been a prophet. We all have to be grateful that he wasn't.Grade 8.8/10",
            "Nevil Shute's On the Beach was written in 1957 amidst the Cold War fears of nuclear annihilation. It has been made into two movies, one in 1959 starring Gregory Peck, Ava Gardner, and Fred Astaire and a smaller budget film in 2000. Shute was a bestselling writer in his time. \"In 2007, Gideon Haigh wrote an article in The Monthly arguing that On the Beach is Australia's most important novel.\" (From the Wikipedia article on Nevil Shute.)It's now probably categorized as science fiction, but there really is no impossible or futuristic science throughout the book. At the time it was written, it was an expression of the fears of many. Now, it is more of an alternative fiction, which is really what all fiction is anyway, of what the world would have been like if a nuclear war had broken out. To not get into the details too much, the story centers on Australia after a nuclear war had totally destroyed the northern hemispehere. Slowly, the radiation spreads south. Shute focuses on a group of people located in Melbourne who know that they are going to all die soon from radiation poisioning that is spreading south. It sounds bleak and depressing, which it is. The sadness of the book is the only reason I did not give it a perfect rating. It is excruciatingly sad.As for the themes, the book tackles suicide. The government manufactured pills for people to take once they began to show signs of radiation sickness. There would be no possibility of recovery once the radiation started poisoning people; nobody could win this battle with death. Through the story, Shute asks, \"Would suicide in such a situation be okay?\"The book made me wonder (not that my little bout with cancer hasn't also done this) if I am doing what I would like to do if I knew that I would die in three months. The people in the book were forced to ask this. In the book, most of the people just kept on doing what they had already been doing. I think I would do the same.In the end, the book really caused me to examine what should be valued in the world we live in. I think I am a better person for having read this book.Entertaining: 4/5Inspiring: 5/5Ethical Thinking: 5/5This book was so depressing that I do not know if I will ever read it again. I will definitely keep this book. It was great to read and challenging to my thoughts. It would also be a great discussion starter.",
            "I generally avoid books like this because they depress me, but I finally gave in after a family member brought it home. No matter how sad, I never cry over movies and books, but in order to finish this book I had to lock myself in the bathroom; I've never cried so much in my life. I finished it yesterday and I can't stop thinking about it. Regardless of whether or not it was scientifically accurate, it drove home the futility of nations building up nuclear arms against each other. Shute's characters have dignity to the end - and his mention of how newspapers would rather have stories of (I'm paraphrasing) \"pin up girls and indecent assaults\" than stories like this was amazingly prescient and ahead of its time. This book broke my heart. Read it, read it, read it -but have a very large box of tissues at your side at the end.",
            "Nevil Shute offers us a grim picture of nuclear apocalypse - but then again, is there any such thing as a picture of nuclear apocalypse that is not grim? \"On the Beach\" was written in the late 1950's (Shute, himself, died in 1960), but the action in the book apparently takes place in the mid-60's, a year after the final war has been fought in the northern hemisphere. The southern hemisphere now waits for the inevitable arrival of lethal fallout, which will complete the eradication of all life on earth.A novel of deep irony, \"On the Beach\" deals with the inhabitants of Australia after the war, who are waiting for the radiation sickness to set in and hoping (though not too deeply) for some kind of reprieve. It is ironic, of course, as we discover that the southern hemisphere never joined the fray - however, it is an effective reminder that in nuclear war, what side one is on or whether one wins or loses are irrelevant questions. We are all on one side, and all of us lose in the end. Although I've heard it billed as a tear-jerker, and I myself did shed a few, it was not an overly emotional book. Mainly, it dealt with the reality of the situation in a matter-of-fact manner - in the end I felt mainly dazed and cold.I'm not in any way a scientist, nor do I have any particular education by which I can judge the accuracy or merit of the story that Shute paints. Perhaps \"modern\" science has a different prediction of how such a scenario would unfold and end - almost certainly it does. Also, I question whether such an all-out event could likely take place - the events leading up to the war seem contrived and unrealistic. Yet, the point of the novel is not to provide a plausible adventure, but rather to emphasize that we don't know what will happen if the bombs ever fall. At the end of the book, as a father applies a cyanide injection to his child - and as I shed my tears for that - I was reminded that, at the very least, I never want to find out.",
            "Nevil Shute wrote this novel 50 years ago, and it is as powerful now as it was then. This story of the last people on earth is simply devastating--in every sense of the word. It amazes me that Shute, an aeronautical engineer who helped Britain design and build nuclear weapons, would sit down 10 years later and produce this horrifying account of the possible effects of his own work. His change of heart is our great gift.As I write this, Cormac McCarthy's novel, THE ROAD, is at the top of the bestseller lists. Read both masterpieces and compare Shute's vision then with McCarthy's vision now, half a century later. The basic premise of both novels is the same: nuclear war, if it comes, will have only one outcome. I hope we will continue to have great artists like this to constantly remind us of that fact. As long as we can still read ON THE BEACH and learn its message, there is still hope.",
            "I enjoyed this book although it was sad. Mankind's swansong if you will. The characters are well written and engaging. I would recommend \"Alas Babylon\" to go with this. I think I enjoyed Alas Babylon more because there was a defiance in the characters that said that mankind will continue and the best will rise to the top and ensure our future.",
            "When he wrote this novel the end of the world in a nuclear holocaust was a very real prospect. Time has passed, and the nuclear threat has receeded. The expectation is that &quot;On the Beach&quot; would become terribly dated as a result.But it is not. The reason may be that Shute concentrated his novel on the people, on how they cope with the end of the world, rather than on the technology, the how and the why.As time goes by the radiation spirals further and further south to threaten the Australians. In response they attempt to go about their business with what normality they can muster. The book raises the interesting questions over how each of us might act when death comes knocking on the door. Do you want to go out in a blaze of glory, vent your anger at fate, or curl up in your own bed and sleep the end away?A great read, it stands the test of time.",
            "On the Beach is a book about good people caught in an impossible situation. Set in Australia, it tells the story of a diverse group of characters who are waiting to die. The whole Northern hemisphere has been obliterated by nuclear war and the clouds of fallout are drifting slowly southward. While they wait, their characters are gradually revealed, like a painting appearing as years of accumulated grime are carefully wiped away. When this book was written it had an enormous impact. People really believed that a nuclear holocaust was likely, if not inevitable, in their lifetimes. For some years, the threat receded but the events of September 11th 2001 have brought those fears back. The weapons are still in their silos, the submarines are still on their stations. We can but hope that sanity will one day prevail. In any case, this book should be read for its poignancy, its beautiful yet simple plot and its optimism in the face of tragedy.",
            "Although the movie is also great, this book remains one of my alltime favorites, first read 40 years ago. There's no time gap - it still seems current and still as real and touching. Highly recommended, as are most of his books",
            "This will be the most desolating, tragic novel you'll ever read. There's no happy ending: everyone dies. Hero and heroine, they both die. Supporting characters, they die. Everyone--and that's *everyone*--else, we all die, too. Let's get that out of the way. No extraterrestrial rescue-ships, no juvenile wish-fulfillment Tom Clancy endings, no elegant James Bond saviours, no immaturely puerile left-wing/right-wing nonsense. Just the bleak fact that everyone dies in the end, leaving only human structures to moulder into complete decay--which is going to to take a long time as the radiation from the northern hemisphere thermonuclear war has killed most of the decay bacteria. Sure, you can quibble about the science of the radiation transport-mechanism, but that was the thinking of the day, and the nuclear winter which would ensue would be just as lethal. Because everyone dies, even the sense of tragedy seems sterile and wasteful.Human civilisation isn't replaced by barbarism, but vanishes entirely. This is the story of the last people to exist in the pathetic ordinariness of their last days. And that is where the Shute novel enters greatness: describing their stories. You can make allowances for fifty years' worth of changes in attitude and world politics, but the theme remains current: even if the end is marked six months from now, we each still have to live life one day at a time, filling those days with the familiar and habitual. It is the divergence between the day-to-day and the ever-approaching inescapable doom which gives this novel its main impetus and power, and Shute is unflinching in his regard of it. So, by making the abstract actual and day-to-day, Shute has written perhaps the bravest novel ever written about the possibility of nuclear annihilation. As I said, no Tom Clancy here.Shute's characters are decent, stoic 'stiff-upper-lip' characters because that's what was the Brit ideal of the time, and it wasn't too far off the truth of the time, that to be decent and accepting was more important than an undignified hysteria. That's how most Brits (who had just survived a murderous war) actually *were* then. Second, there's not much action because Shute was a member of the old school of story-tellers which believed in craft rather than jolts (maybe the difference between British and the more excitable American readers). When reading a Shute novel, typically, you can spend the first twenty pages wondering why you're bothering, and the next hundred pages trying, unsuccessfully, to put it down--that's called storytelling, folks, and Shute, for all his potboiler plots, was a master of the innocent-seeming spinning of webs which eventually bound you to the characters in his plots, which almost invariably presented ordinary people with extraordinary circumstance, so closely that you had to finish the book.On The Beach is no exception to Shute's usual subtle entrancement (one reviewer at the time said the novel held 'a cobra fascination' for him); also, I found it fascinating that the greatest book about thermonuclear war was not, as one would expect given the large number of doomsday novels published at the time, a US or Brit science-fiction writer but a 1950's British professional romance-writer. A bleak, desolate masterpiece.",
            "This book brought me the closest to tears I've been in sooo long. This book...affected me. I've been pacifist for two years, now (I'm in 8th grade,) but...geezYou must read this book. Trust me.",
            "What a disappointment!I love the movie starring Gregory Peck, Ava Garner and Fred Astaire. Itwas atmospheric and scary. I figured that such a good movie must come from agood book. Wrong!The book is poorly written, full of unlikeable characters-except for the captain-andit's full of Australian slang that isn't explained. A good concept wasted on a poorly written book.The movie made much more of the story and I can't wait to watch it again.Interesting that such a mediocre book made such a good movie.Save your money and buy the CD instead.",
            "Written to feel like it could really happen. Nuclear fallout from war or any nuclear accident is not a local event. The effects could touch the entire globe. I thought of this book in considering how the damaged nuclear plants in Japan could be a worldwide disaster.",
            "Whenever later in life you decide what books you enjoyed and yet can't quite get the old internal memory organ to improve intellectually but you know somehow you enjoyed the read more than most - that is just the book you should read again. I recall this novel as a great emotional, sobering journey made in my middle years. That first read was surely exaggerated by experiences of sticking my head under a school desk during nuclear war drills at grade school. Ok, so you have to be a \"boomer\" to remember this but guess what, given the recent political charade what comes next could be the chance of a nuclear winter as Shute describes not in scientific detail but in human frailty and heroism. Existing leaders who only think about increasing the size of their weapons should read this novel and re-read like I just have. Not only is it a well written story full of emotion and surprises but it is also a warning. It was true when written and still seems to be just on the surface of truth because our way of life has been and still is threatened by our way of life! Full of humor in the face of disaster and the common humane nature of men who lean on each other for strength even at the step of final and terrible death makes the reader stay faithful. These characters are endurable, likable, familiar even when inevitably terminable. Shute doesn't leave us much but maybe one or two survived, somehow - one can hope. Remember, this is fiction - yes? Thank you Mr. Author.",
            "What if the powerful countries of the world waged a nuclear war so catastrophic that all life was destroyed, and you were stuck in southern Australia, watching the deadly radiation move slowly, inexorably your way? That is the question posed by this classic post-apocalyptic novel. The inevitable conclusion is rather dreary. However, the characters seem a bit too 1950s, and therefore not quite realistic. Still, it's an interesting, if bleak, what-if scenario.",
            "I was searching for fiction similar in tone to McCarthy's 'The Road' and came across this older title. Very haunting read. Showcases believable common people and how they would conduct themselves while facing the impending nuclear doom. A great cautionary tale in our often uncertain times. Schools should make novels like this required reading moreso than some of the removed literary 'classics' in my opinion.",
            "Nevil Shute's book about the collapse and extermination of civilisation after a nuclear war. The resulting devastating radiation effects from the Northern Hemisphere are taking some time to reach the Southern Hemisphere, but it too is doomed, including Australia.People know how long they have left in the history of the human race.",
            "The book On The Beach was an exciting and intense book. It was a book on life after nuclear bombs were dropped. In this book they were dropped in the northern hemisphere. It was an intense book because you didn't know what was going to happen next. I enjoyed On The Beach because I expected something dull to happen every time I turned the page, but something completely different happened. It was enjoyable not only for it's suspense but also for the love shared between the characters. They cared for each other enough to ask them to kill themselves if the radiation got to bad. If you want to know what life would be like after a nuclear war, read this book. If you support it you will probably change your mind. This book might even improve your vocabulary. I highly recommend this book.",
            "After nuclear war wipes out the Northern hemisphere, the radiation gradually creeps South, killing everything in its path. In Melbourne (at the time, the world's southernmost city), people realize they have only a few months to live, that there is no escape, and they sit and wait to die. Pretty grim. Of course, everyone is just finding ways to fill in the time and distract themselves. ...'On the beach' has been quoted widely with regards to Australians referring to England as 'home' even though they'd never been there. It's the only time I've ever come across that phenomenon. I actually found that these 1950s Australians quite familiar and interesting: much more British than Australians nowadays, still in that stiff duty mode from the second world war, and facing certain death. I think the listless writing style was very successful in conveying the sense of despair and doom.It's a powerful novel, profound probably, and quite awful.",
            "I'm re-reading this book because I can still remember the way it stoned me as a junior high kid as the Cold War still lingered. This book, along with Kerouac's On The Road and a couple of Hemingway's masterpieces helped me cross the bridge from impressionable youth to building a life based on character, making my own experiences, and respecting and appreciating the ability to do so for as long as I can. On the Beach is still so very relevant. I won't ever forget the impression it left on me.",
            "I haven't been able to understand why this book is so popular! Nevil shute is a REALLY great author, and has written books that are much more thought provoking like &quot;In The Wet&quot;, &quot;Round the Bend&quot;, &quot;The Rainbow and the Rose&quot;, &quot;A Old Captivity&quot; and many others I have read and re-read over the years. He writes books about common people, very heartwarming stories, which when you finish, make you think the world might not be in such bad shape after all. Many of his books revolve around aviation, as he was one of the first aeronautical engineers, and one of the original employees of DeHavalland Aircraft. His book &quot;Slide Rule&quot; is basically an autobiography. The period covered by his novels varies from just after WWI - &quot;Marizan&quot;, many of WWII era &quot;Landfall&quot;, to the early 1950's &quot;The Far Country&quot; set, like many of his later novels, in Australia. &quot;On the Beach&quot; is so out of character to the rest of his works, it is almost difficult to realize it is written by the same author. If you have read it, read some of his OTHER books, they're MUCH better!",
            "This novel was a big disappointment to me. I had expected something rather better written, however the characters are cardboard, the dialogue is wooden, and it reminded me of a shooting script for a TV soap. The redeeming feature is not the plot line (which I thought was absurd) but the background scenario, the condition precedent for the story.**SOME SPOILERS** The background is that a nuclear war has taken place, and has engulfed the entire northern hemisphere. Everyone there is dead. The southern hemisphere survivors await the clouds of radioactive and toxic fallout to arrive and kill them too. I find this an intriguing idea.But that is as far as it goes. We are supposed to believe that, in the small Australian town described, people remained well-behaved and civilised, there was no looting rape or assault, people still showed up to work, and property continues to change hands in exchange for money. Well, something tells me it wouldn't be like that. Also, the dialogue is so corny that the characters are never clearly drawn. Overall, it's a thumbs-down from me.",
            "At first I was surprised to find what seemed to be very little action. About 50 pages in I was wondering when the tension would rise and things would really start. But that never happened. It's poetic in that way. Very \"Hollow Men\" - Not with a bang but a whimper. The whole book felt like the dying whimper of humanity, and that made it unique and special and perfectly executed in my opinion. I think Shute accomplished exactly what he intended by keeping things low-key and not melodramatic. It was still a book I got engrossed in, perhaps because it didn't fit any kind of typical survival/action/end of the world scenario. No roving gangs, no shoot 'em up, no real preparedness. Not to say I don't like those types of books. This one was just different, not made to be depressing or moralistic or inspiring or anything, I don't think. Just, here's the end, wrought by humans, nothing anyone can do. And then considering how people might handle that. Great book.",
            "It starts of a bit slow, but it is a great book. Just stick with it. It's one of the best books I've read in a while",
            "This book is one of the most depressing books I've read, which is good due to the theme. I mean, people can't be happy that they're *SPOILER AHEAD* going to die. Like most say, the book does lack depth in a sense that there is no underlying theme. But it is enjoyable read page after page. The more you read through the book, the more suspense you will have the close you get to the end. I was a junior in high school when I read this. I was reading this in class and I got extremely choked up. This book is sad, but its even worse if you consider the characters mindset near the end of the book. It's heartbreaking that some things happen the way they do in the book, however, what makes this book so good is that it is realistic. Their emotions, their actions etc are very realistic. Which only makes the characters feel close to you. Great, realistic, to the core type of book. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?",
            "I just reread this about 8 years after my first reading. The first time you read it, it leaves you shattered - and the second time you will be effected the same way. But the second reading allows you to focus in on more details and admire Shute's writing style and character development.Needless to say, On The Beach is the epitomie of the End of the World genre. It's thorough and devestating. But what makes this stand out as the champion of the genre is the HEART shown in the book. This is the everyman's version of the end of the world. There are no silly survivalist groups, no hoarding masses, no space ships built to carry away a few lucky survivors. This is the simple story of an American Navy officer who found himself in Australia praying to get home to his family, and an Australian naval lt. balancing his family life with the love of his job.Some reviewers have bashed the book for not aging well. I would strongly disagree. It's amazing to me how relevant this book still is - over 50 years after the book was first published. Have we learned nothing during this time?There is a scene towards the end of the book where one character asks if the disaster could have been prevented, to which another characters states possibly, if the newspapers had made the possibility of disaster known to the masses, BUT:\"We liked our newspapers with pictures of beach girls and headlines about indecent assault, and no Government was wise enough to stop us having them that way. But something might have been done with newspapers, if we'd been wise enough.\"Sound familiar?",
            "A classic in the field of apocalyptic fiction, I'm not sure why I put off reading it for so long.... until I read it. Quite depressing. The denialism and fatalism in this story written at the height of the Cold War makes me very very glad that that period of history is over. Our children, of course, have other end-of-the-world worries, but slowly dying of radiation isn't one of them (not that the nuclear weapons are gone.. we just don't think about them which is another form of denialism, I guess).I wonder why the idea of hiding out in radiation proof bunkers (ala Farnham's Freehold by Heinlein) wasn't explored by Shute. Five years was all they needed for the radiation to dissipate... surely SOME people could've survived that long underground. Stoically facing ones doom is a bit more \"English\" I suppose.. stiff upper lip and all that...I enjoyed the story, highly recommend it, and suggest that if you like Shute's style, thatA Town Like Aliceis another enjoyable read.",
            "I have seen the movie based on this book On the Beach starring Gregory Peck, Ava Gardner and Tony Perkins, and the movie was quite faithful to this book, though the book of course had more story to it, and was a very entertaining read. Though a sad story of how a last unaffected city is dealing with the fears of approaching nuclear meltdown, this book is very true to life in how people might react to this situation, the anxieties, and the helplessness of realizing there is nothing to be done to stop the approaching genocide. This book should be required reading in all schools around the world, so young readers can face the realities of living in the atomic age, and try to acquire more fans of nuclear disarmament.",
            "`On the Beach' is one of the best books I have read in quite some time. Not only is it exceptionally well written, but it is gripping and moving as well.After a global war and the northern hemisphere being wiped out by nuclear bombs, the people of Australia are waiting as the radiation cloud slowly makes it's way towards them. An American submarine captain is stranded in Australia and makes friends with his Australian naval colleagues and with a young woman who reminds him of his wife who perished back in America. You follow them as they prepare for the worst and how they go about their lives in the last few months.One thing I found especially refreshing about this book is that everyone is remarkably civil to one another and law and order hasn't broken down. The main menace comes from the approaching radiation cloud, rather than the breakdown of society. It is thoughtful without being maudlin and the last fifty pages or so were especially moving and handled with great sensitivity. You finish the book feeling both saddened and satisfied which is truly the mark of excellent writing.I was surprised just how well this was written. Shute writes with rich descriptions that make you conjure the images up in your head instantly and fully engage with the story and characters. It moves at a decent pace and although the chapters are quite long, you can't help but read through them in large chunks until you reach the shattering conclusion. This left me feeling profoundly affected and I'm sure it will stay with me for a long time to come and I will revisit it at some point down the line. It is highly praised for good reason and I happily add my endorsement to this gripping and affecting novel.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.",
            "I read this book about 44 years ago when I was a kid and still remember passages. One of the best novels ever written! So strong was it that it's being said that it was so realistic no nation has ever dropped an atomic bomb on another nation since WW2.I caught the movie on TV yesterday the end with the empty streets of Australia when the radiation cloud finally arrives and the last people on earth are dead, makes one want to cry (and it did when I was younger)...but now as I have gotten older and seen too much of the brutality of mankind, my mind has changed and I think maybe it's time to nuke the whole place. People haven't and won't change. They'll just keep murdering each other until they are finally extinct.Funny how time and seeing too much of humanity changes one's perspective on this book.",
            "In conjuring up books that concern Cold War paranoaia, I am often reminded of Nevil Shute's masterful &quot;On the Beach&quot;. This book is oriented for people below the age of 12. I believe this because of its dramatic intensity, explicity, and depressing ending. The story involves a navy captain who is attempting to lead a team of scientists through various radioactive plants. Their mission: to discover if in fact, radioactivity will lead to Earth's immineant destruction. The officer's wife begains to dissuade her husband from leading the expedition. However, fate intervenes and the government appoints him for the perilous mission. As they embark, each crew member will have to live in proximity 23 &quot;mates&quot;. The main problem on the mission is that many of the crew members loathe each other even more than the expedition. Shute does an excellent job at forming mini-biographies surrounding each character involved in the expedition. Shute revels facts as: Where they grew up, family, characteristics, and numerous other obscure facts. Every integral character has a dramatic presents in each chapter. Exposition is filled with wonderful discriptions of each character and essence of story. Which leads me to the mext paragraph. The narrative is very atmospheric. Atmospheric in the fact that it highly corresponds to the Cold War confusion that plauged America in the 50's and 60's. Shute chooses a documentary style of writing to explain the mission more explicitly. However, Shute aknowledges that spectacle alone will never suceed, characters will! Shute's unabated intusiasm and boyant persona endorsed the narrative to the fullest. In conclusion, this book is a fascinating novel. If anyone chooses to explore and study character development, should be forced to study &quot;On the Beach&quot;.",
            "On the BeachWritten by Nevil ShuteDirected by Stanley KramerThis review is about the movie. However, this review is equally applicable to the book. The book was successful in providing more details and continuing the experience of the story.I own this movie, along with other movies, such as, The Cruel Sea, Hombre, Day of the Jackal, French Connection, and Papillon.The movie inspired me to read the book. I also dream to visit Melbourne someday.I first saw this movie decades ago. It stayed in my mind. A year ago, I bought the DVD, without questioning whether it would be worth it to own.I have watched it multiple times. It's the kind of movie to fall asleep to in order to avoid loud commercials, except for the end.One cool part is when there is almost no gasoline for driving in cars, you can see old Melbourne (circa 1959) with no combustion-engine vehicles except a very few for the military. So the people of the most southern major city in the world are getting around by: walking; bicycling; horse-back; horse-drawn carriages; and some public transportation.The casting is very good. Gregory Peck and Anthony Perkins are true to their characters in the book. Eva Gardner is in it to broaden audience appeal. Fred Astaire is believable as a scientist. I especially liked the performance of Donna Anderson.This movie is not for everyone. Would you like to ponder what you would do if you were one of the few survivors of radiation, and your time would be up in approximately six months.The plot of the story demonstrates the pleasant life near Melbourne which is made more appealing in light of the impending end, just as death makes our individual lives seem more precious. The crew of the surviving American nuclear submarine go on a mission to explore the American west coast including Alaska to search for any kind of life or hope that the radiation is receding. The story also shows the power of denial in our minds when facing the end.My generation lived in fear of this type of nuclear holocaust. Unlike this story, I believe that some of human kind along with the eco-system would survive a nuclear holocaust. It is ironic that the reduction of carbon emissions caused by a nuclear holocaust could save the humanity and the eco-system in the relative long term. In the absolute long term, the planet, the solar system, and the galaxy are temporary.A similar book and/or movie like this should be made about climate change, only instead of Fred Astaire drunkenly yelling at a party that the radiation is nine times normal background radiation, he should yell that the atmospheric temperature is one and a half times normal.",

If you're looking for a morbid, anti-climatic story with little plot and way too much superficial description, this is a book for you.On the Beach was written during the cold war, when the specter of a nuclear apocalypse was ever present. The book takes the \"we're all gonna die\" mantra to heart. Reading it during the times would have surely resonated, and this is the only real value of the book. It gives a peek into the morbid obsession with nuclear armegeddon.The book flatlines about 1/4th of the way through, and you spend the rest reading about the characters planting gardens, buying items, and other trivial boring crap. You keep expecting something to happen... but nothing does.If you want to read a good post-apocalyptic book from the era, I recommend Day of the Triffids or Alas, Babylon.",
            "This is one of the best books I have ever read in my life, it is up there with Mauprat an Paula...",
            "Maybe I'm just of Gen X and need a little more excitement, but I picked up this book expecting great things since everyone calls it 'The best book about the end of the world ever', but I found it extremely dull. Maybe I went into it with the wrong expectations, but this is just a boring story about boring people who happen to be facing the end of the world. This would be a perfect book for the Oprah book club, because all those stories deal with boring people as well. I personally would have liked to have heard more about the submarine trips and have them gone onto shore and delved into that a bit more. Instead, I got stories about an alcoholic woman, a garden, a playpen, a car race, etc. The only reason this got 3 stars is because I liked the suicide pills, I liked the way everyone kept going on with their lives, like they weren't going to die. That aspect of things was interesting, but nothing about this book was compelling to me, not the writing, nor any of the characters. I found it hard to relate to any of them. Since I seem to be on the opposite end of the spectrum of everyone else, maybe I'm just missing something, so you should probably read it and see for yourself, but I'm sorry, there are many other better books out there about the end of the world (i.e. The Stand, Lucifer's Hammer, etc.)",

            "On The Beach is the story of the results of a nuclear war and the last days left for those that survived it. The war pretty much has annihilated the Northern Hemisphere, with the remaining population living mostly in Austrailia, where most of the story takes place. We watch as these people, knowing that their time is limited due to the &quot;nuclear cloud&quot; that is slowly drifting towards the southern hemisphere, live their last months to their fullest. We have the Navy, headed by the Austrailians and one American, sailing to the north in search of survivors of this war. We have people like you and I, living in Austrailia, going about their every day lives, living as if there IS a tomorrow, as if there IS a next year. The tension increases as the story heads towards the end, and the reader knows there is no mistaking what that end would be.There is no blood or gore in this post-nuclear war story. If you want that, rent MAD MAX. This book is about people living every day,knowing that their lives are about to be cut short. It's about people dying with dignity. And it's about the devastation of war, and the stupidity that can cause a nuclear war in our own futures.Nevil Shute's ON THE BEACH is a classic. If you want to read a great nuclear war/end of the world book written before the end of the Cold War, this is it.",
            "&quot;On the Beach&quot; is one of those books that you read for the concept and the story, but not for the quality of the writing. The plot centers around the lives of a few remaining survivors of a nuclear war who live in Australia. Since the was has taken place in the northern hemisphere, Australia has largely escaped unscathed--for the moment. But as prevailing winds approach Australia, they carry lethal doses of radiation with them. The implication of this is that all of the characters in the book--in fact everyone in the world--will inevitably be extinguished.&quot;On the Beach&quot; has a profound psychological impact because it is devoid of the intense action that usually accompanies nuclear apocolypse films. The destruction has already occurred elsewhere and the citizens of Australia are largely going about their business knowing they will soon die. The fact that their infrastructure has not been destroyed and that all of their social aparatus is still intact makes their fate all the more sad and earie.Although this book is set in the Cold War it's outcome is still relevant and feasible today. The nuclear warheads generated by the arms race haven't gone away. The former Soviet Union is a desparate, chaotic place, and as several reviewers pointed out, more small countries are joining the nuclear club. One could say that Nuclear madness has merely transformed itself, but its danger certainly hasn't disappeared.I think everyone should read this book to be reminded of the possible future we all face.I read &quot;On the Beach&quot; in 1989. That same year I had seen &quot;The Day After&quot; and &quot;Testament&quot;. For some reason I had a morbid fascination with the end of the world, and what might happen after.&quot;On the Beach&quot; might seem a bit dated now. The consequences of nuclear war have been speculated upon for several years. In 1983 scientists came up with the nuclear winter theory, where all the dust and fallout from the explosions would block out the sun and cause the world to freeze over. It sounds plausible enough. Once the winter was over the ozone layer would be damaged and the planet saturated with ultaviolet light from the sun. Others argue that people would survive somewhere, not everyone would die from radiation.Whatever the case, &quot;On the Beach&quot; is still a powerful book. It makes you wonder how you would feel, knowing how you were going to die and when. The Australians are fortunate in that they are offered suicide pills for when the pain becomes too much. People aren't so worried about nuclear war any more. But on the news this morning I saw Boris Yeltsin remind Bill Clinton that they still have a nuclear arsenal. This was after Clinton threatened Russia with sanctions if Russian forces attacked Grozny... But we've managed to avoid nuclear war up until now, so there's probably nothing to worry about. Is there?",
            "In _In Search of Wonder_ (1967), Damon Knight devotes a chapter to \"amphibians\"-- mainstream authors who write a science fiction novel and then go back to what they were doing before. Some examples of amphibious books are Aldous Huxley's _Brave New World_ (1932), Bernard Wolfe's _Limbo_ (1952), Gore Vidal's _Messiah_ (1954), Pat Frank's _Alas, Babylon_ (1959), Anthony Burgess's _A Clockwork Orange_ (1962), Pierre Boulle's _Planet of the Apes_ (1963), William Burroughs's _Nova Express_ (1964), John Barth's _Giles Goat-Boy_ (1966), and Marge Piercy's _Woman on the Edge of Time_ (1976). Many amphibious novels are in fact more literate and original than a lot of genre science fiction.Is _On the Beach_ (1957) an amphibious novel? Knight argues-- and I concur-- that it is not. There are a few superficial resemblances to science fiction; but unlike the novels listed above, it is not really steeped in science fiction traditions. It is closer to such books as William Golding's _Lord of the Flies_ (1954), B.F. Skinner's _Walden Two_ (1948), Mordecai Roshwald's _Level Seven_ (1959), or Eugene Budrick and Harvey Wheeler's _Fail Safe_ (1962)-- novels that are eccentric but which were conceived and written as some kind of mainstream novel.Is it a good novel? You might think that a novel showing the world ending \"not with a bang/ But with a whimper\" is not a very promising proposition. But Shute is a writer who knows how things work. He knows how submarines and sailboats and Ferraris work. He knows what the best tires are for wagons and why cars are sometimes pulled with horses. He knows how to read a Geiger counter. He knows how Navy bureaucracy operates and what hard decisions politicians sometimes make. He knows the routine of running a farm or tending a garden. He knows why suddenly socks must be darned and shirts must be mended. He knows what a postwar church service would be like. He knows what drinks not to mix together, and he knows the best wines to drink from the wine cellar. He knows how the trade winds circle, blowing radiation ever southward. He knows the symptoms of radiation sickness, measles, and cyanide poisoning.He does not know any more than his characters how World War III began, but he-- like the characters-- knows how it _might_ have begun. How there was a Russian plan for a Siberian- Shanghai railroad, and how this plan, incredibly, might have led to a war where split second decisions were made-- a war in which nobody could risk refraining from using kilotons of nuclear weapons. (Shute had been an areonautical engineer who knew a lot about weapons. This section, in spite of its speculative nature, rings very true.)He knows why people do certain things. He knows why some people try to escape into drink, others into the routine of work, and others into family affairs. He appreciates why some people do not want to watch movies except when they are drunk. He understands why some people still think of their dead family as alive, and why others might become morbidly obsessed with death.Shute draws you into the world of these people who desperately want to continue to live normal lives-- but who know that their hopes are futile. But... would things really wind down as quietly as we see it portrayed in _On the Beach_? No rioting in the streets? No breakdown of civil order? Just a few decent people accepting their lot with stiff upper lips? I don't know. Shute writes so well that he makes you _believe_ that it could happen this way, but I Have My Doubts. In any event, _On the Beach_ is certainly a fine book that holds up very well, even after a period of almost 50 years.",
            "\"It's not the end of the world at all,\" he said. \"it's only the end off us. The world will go on just the same, only we shan't be in it. I dare say it will get along all right without us\"...I finally brought myself a copy of On The Beach. Since seeing the film (the ending of which still devastates me to this day) there was no way that I was going to bypass the book. Books are usually better than film. I'm not sure that is the case with this one.The story is about so many things- about hope, politics, desire, love and mortality. How would you be if you were faced with the knowledge that in less than a year you and your family would suffer a terrible and excruciating death?The story looks more at the way that people would cope with the situation- the denial, the constant ache of knowing that you would never get to do the things that you always wanted, the boredom of having to wait.The book however elicited less emotion than the film. Not so much the story as the way that it was written. The baby was more often 'it' than 'she', his descriptions were flat and the generational gap was wide. Nowadays men have more liberty to share and show their emotions, though Shute's male characters are all very middle of the century `men must be men'. The father shows little to no emotion or connection to his family, the child is but a thing.That doesn't mean that it wasn't any good. I was still on the brink of tears and it was a very good story that will stay with me for a very long time, I just wish that I had read it before I watched the movie.I know that I will be passing this book on because someone needs to read it. It's a great book on so many levels. Political stupidity, human nature, reality. Read it. I'd give it 4 and a half stars if I could. Four isn't enough, five is too much.",
            "I have read this book twice now - with a space of 14 years in between - and I found I got a lot more out of it and remembered quite a lot from the first time. It was and remains the only book I've ever read that caused me to have tears streaming down my face at the end. The realism with which Shute presents his plot and its concept - the immediate after-math of an atomic/hydrogen war and the slow spreading of a radioactive envelope in the earth's atmosphere toward the Southern Hemisphere - is scary. With the approaching radioactivity comes the DOOM of the main characters of the story who live in Melbourne, Australia and who include among them a displaced U.S. submarine captain. What Shute offers us here is the ultimate &quot;what-if&quot;. What if this REALLY happened? How would any human being react if he/she could literally see the End coming and could not stop it? Shute's characters are haunting in that they are so REAL themselves just in the way they lash out in anger and moral injustice or recoil in overwhelming despair or even just succumb to numbing apathy. It is the infinite care and love with which Shute creates and develops them and portrays them to us that makes this not a hysterical sermon but a human story. Then he leaves them to die. As a reader you are devastated because you are left with nothing. Each of the characters in the end has to find their own way to die and the very last one is the one who seemed to have the most life and the most promise and the most vitality. Do I recommend this book? YES. You will never forget it.",
            "I've never seen this novel in a list of science fiction classics, but that's what it is. Shute, an English writer who moved to Australia, was a popular novelist of genius - he also wrote the famous war romance, A Town Like Alice (1950). In the 1950s there were many stories about global disasters, reflecting the fears roused by the threat of nuclear holocaust. Of all such stories, On the Beach is the most powerful, and the most direct. It's set in Melbourne. Nuclear war has devastated the northern hemisphere, destroying all life; and now, slowly but inevitably, the radiation is creeping southwards. Shute tells the story of the last months, before all life on earth is annihilated. Not only a deeply disturbing prophecy, this is also a triumph of storytelling: to write so gripping a novel, in which the main event has happened before the first page, in which the ending is inevitable, and no heroic action can avert the catastrophe, is a considerable literary achievement.",
            "In my opinion, this book is, today, wrongly classified as \"science fiction\". Being written in 1957, and a product of an incipient Cold War, maybe it was science fiction back in the fifties, but now \"On the beach\" is more like \"apocalyptic fiction\".The story is about what could have happened if the northern countries decided to strike nuclear attacks on each other in 1961. Two years later, the whole upper part of the globe has fallen under the radioative cloud, ant there's no one left. Because of the wind patterns, this dooming cloud is slowly reaching southern countries like Brazil, Argentina, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.Dwight Towers is the commander of one of the two remaining submarines existent in the US Navy, now based on Melbourne. There, he meets Moira Davidson, a young alcoholic woman, and her two friends, Australian navy-man Peter Holmes and his wife, Mary, and they have to cope with, literally, the end of the world.\"On the beach\" is not an action book, and it's not about heroic achievements to save what remains of Earth. This is a book of sorrow and regret. Nevil Shute's characters can be divided between those who have accepted their terrible fate, and those who will deny it until the end. That's what is most interesting, and most depressive too.Not a long book, \"On the beach\" seems to drag on for the first three-quarters, only setting a gray but necessary background, but the final chapters are like the water running down the drain in an emptying sink: twisty, fast-paced and hypnotic. Yes, hypnotic is a good word. The reader will keep reading, trying himself to look for ways out, only to discover that sometimes reality is more powerful than imagination.\"On the beach\" is sad all the way. In fact, the title alone is very depressive, once the reader understand its meaning, disclosed on a poem in the first page, and in the very last line. But it is also a powerful reading, one that will stick to the reader's mind after the book is finished. And, after all, this surely could have happened; in fact, Nevil Shute could have been a prophet. We all have to be grateful that he wasn't.Grade 8.8/10",

Written in 1959, the story depicts the aftermath in Australia of a nuclear war that Nevil Shute describes as taking place in the early 1960's. Neither Australia, nor any other nation south of the equator was the target of a nuclear device, but those in the southern hemisphere are condemned to death by radiation poisoning in the six or so months it takes the fallout to completely blanket the earth.Unlike the movie versions of his novel, Shute does not use his story to overtly condemn nuclear weapons, war, or America. Instead he focuses on the lives of a handful of characters whom he turns into a microcosm of humanity facing what we must all inevitably face.From Shute's description, Australian society was cemented together in such a way that even in the face of annihilation everyone would continue life in its accustomed patterns to the very end. The party animals continue to party. The sportsmen participate in their sports until they are physically unable to continue. Families raise their children and improve their properties to the very last day. Government workers compile and produce reports until there is no one left to read them. The surviving military of non-existent nations follows orders, protocol, and traditions that eternity has rendered meaningless. Students continue their studies to earn pieces of paper to hang on their walls. In short, no one breaks ranks in panic; everyone dies in formation.It's not that the individuals in the story are fearless stoics; each is shaken by the personal horror of death and the pointlessness of this life, but each constructs a fantasy or a purpose sufficient to maintain equilibrium to the end. For Dwight Towers, the CO of the USS Scorpion, finally the last vestige of America, it is upholding the highest traditions of the United States Navy and being absolutely true to his dead wife and children whom he expects to see again very, very shortly. For Moira, who loves him, it is becoming a woman worthy of a great man, a woman who because she truly loves this great man will not do anything to exploit his vulnerability to her considerable appeal. For John Osborne, the scientist, it is doing what he has always wanted but been afraid to do, auto racing. And for Peter and Mary Holmes it is planning and planting their garden and watching and worrying over their baby girl.Today no society anywhere is very well cemented, and there really are no ranks to break or formations to keep. Death is as certain for us as it was for the characters in Nevil Shute's novel. Sadly, we have nothing left to believe in.",
            "This will be a short review because a long one isn't necessary.If there's a post-apocalyptic novel that my girlfriend like's more than I do, you know you're in for a touch of romanticism, benevolent themes--and realism. As a fan of Bioshock and Fallout 3, the description--even the name On The Beach--spoke to me. Now, the truth of the matter is, it isn't anything like Bioshock or Fallout 3--it's more like the blend of The Notebook and Impact--that one movie with Morgan Freeman and the dude that plays Frodo Baggins--also a bit of Danny Boyle's Sunshine.The story takes place after a nuclear fallout (so you can see why being a fan of Fallout 3 drew me in) and it's about an American naval Captain and a some Australian people in a small town in Australia. The book is about them living their lives, waiting for the end to come. What little plot is in the novel plays around with them hoping that the radiation doesn't hit them.It's a bleak, lonely story; the novel is a decently quick read--the theme is varied, perhaps it's up to the reader to come up with one, as art sometimes does; and if I could boldly say what I got from this novel, it would be this: everyone is going to die sooner or later, but you might as well live your life with morality in mind; it's about doing the right thing regardless of the fact you're going to die. I don't want to go all preachy, so I won't, because On The Beach is never preachy either--it's a subtle sermon of living life to your fullest without being immoral and crazy.This post-apocalyptic is quite the opposite of Cormac McCarthy's The Road, but the themes aren't so different . . . it's just the opposite side of the same coin.It's a 4/5 because it's not the most exciting or best written novel in the world, but what it's trying to say is what's beautiful. I dare say that someday I'll read this book again, after I get through my seemingly endless list of books to read. Don't read it if you're a fan of The Stand, Swan Song, Oryx and Crake, etc... this novel is not meant to excite or make you think. It's just meant to make you feel something.",
            "I've found it's dicey business to revisit books I've loved some decades later. Couldn't finish \"Stranger in a Strange Land,\" found \"The Wonderful Flight to the Mushroom Planet\" paled before \"The Golden Compass,\" and left \"Dune\" half-read for a younger set of sci-fi fans. \"On the Beach,\" however, was as compelling and timely as the first time through.Peopled with everyday heroes, this book is yet another \"Lesson Before Dying\" or perhaps more accurately a lesson about living. And no one sums it up more succinctly than Moira who gets an A+ on her final exam:\"...we're none of us going to have time to do all that we planned to do. But we can keep on doing it as long as we can.\"Oh to whom shall I lend this book? But those who make the short list must promise to give it back. Don't miss this classic!",
            "What would you do if you only had six months to live? Unfortunately, this is a choice that some people face on an everyday basis, due to cancer or some other illness. In the case of Shute's novel, the characters find themselves faced with a rather messy, prolonged death by radiation sickness. One of the several post-apocalyptic classics to emerge form the Cold War Era, this is a very humane, compassionate look at a group of people living out their final days in a major Australian city after a series of nuclear wars wipe out all life in the Northern hemisphere.The characters reactions to their impending doom make it a very British book, reminiscent of the old World War II slogan, \"Keep calm and carry on.\" While every now and then someone reacts with intense despair, most of the citizens of this Australian town come to accept their fate and instead see it as a blessing that they are able to die together with their families. One character even reasons that it's better to take your own life while in your prime - albeit in unfortunate circumstances - rather than to linger into old age in a nursing home.There are some moments of mild, if sometimes shocking humor. An instance of this humor is Shute's narration of Australia's last Grand Prix race, writing of how people come out to the races to compete in their Bentleys, Ferraris, Jaguars, Maseratis, and Thunderbirds (including a car I've never heard of, called a \"Gipsy Lotus\"), only for half of the contestants to die mangled in wrecks. \"He got it the way he wanted it to be,\" the wife of one crash victim serenely comments. \"None of this being sick and all the rest of it\" (217).The ultimate conclusion of the novel is that if humanity is capable of such atrocity, then perhaps the race isn't worthy of the planet it so eagerly destroys. A cautionary, contemplative portrait of mankind faced with its own mortality. Highly recommended.",
            "I ordered this book for my granddaughter because it's premise has great application to today. I read it in the 60's.",
            "Numerous reviews capture the essence of the book accurately. Both the negative and positive reviews are accurate in their descriptions of the reasons. It is a challenge to read, especially from a 1950s, Cold War perspective.Nonetheless, I read it as a mid-teen in the late 1970s or early 1980s; very much in the throes of the second cold war. It was absolutely compelling then (read it in a single sitting) and now, as a 46-yr old. I now mostly listen to audiobooks while driving and found myself able to finish sentences, it was so compelling and memorable the first time.Yes, it antiquated, but so is the concept and the consequence. I read fiction not for grammar (one review's principal criticism; what would he say about Joyce?) or for accuracy. I can't describe what I find profound in a book, but when I can still remember sentences after a single read and a 30 year gap, I know I found it.",
            "Bought this for my husband at his request after reading another book written by Neville Shute. He read the entire book within 2 days -- says he couldn't put it down! It kept him on the edge of his seat the entire time. Neville made him think \"how likely is this to happen in real life in our current state of affairs?\"",
            "This powerful book woke me up at night forcing me to examine how I would handle the knowledge of sure death! Shute's writing in timeless. Written sixty year ago, On The Beach, engages still engages the modern reader, making us care about the characters. It is on my list for my ten year old to read when he turns sixteen. In fact, it should be required reading for all high school students not only because it well written but also because it explores the wide ranging implications of nuclear war. A must read...for so many reasons!",
            "On the Beach is emotionally tolling from the first thirty pages. The cast know the radiated dust is circling the planet bound ever further south towards the southern coast of Australia, yet the families still continue their mundane bucolic existence. Each chapter brings the plot and people closer and closer to the inevitable death via emesis and diarrhea. It's not a pretty death but each can choose each owns idiosyncratic death before the Big Death comes along.Families plant gardens ready to bloom next year, the hardware store still charges for items and the farm animals must continue to be fed. Dealing with tragedy is to act as if the inevitable is but a whispered fib, an unlikely conclusion or a passing fad. While the facts of global death from radiation, the radio silence from the northern hemisphere and the absence of life from submariner observation, the families talk lightly of the September death, the slow death, the inevitable death. It's painful to read the passages where the logistics of baby Jennifer must be discussed and when the topic of `taking the pill' when it becomes too agonizing.Shute writes with a dash good vocabulary, a wide range of commonplace activities, the light conversations dealing with death and the infusion of banal details surrounding auto racing, fly fishing and gardening. Even while knowing that this book was once a serialized publication, I found most of the nine chapters to be very lengthy, devoid of stoppages, section breaks. It's not a very artsy novel, the passages aren't very well structured and it's mostly a flat novel dotted with a sinking depression bringing the reader near tears. For that feat alone, Shute merits a high rating.",
            "What would you do if you knew the world was ending in a few short weeks? The book looks at several people in Australia and how they deal with the end of the world caused by radiation poisoning after World War III. Even though countries in the southern hemisphere didn't participate in the war, they suffer the consequences of radiation sickness as well. This isn't a book about life after an event de-populates most of the earth and how to go on. In this book EVERYONE will die. The book is actually about coming to terms with the enevitable. Once read On TheBeach, you will still be thinking about it. Although written many years ago, it still seems timely. If you compare the time period (mid 50's) to today, would things be different? Would mankind react differently? That's what keeps you thinking!",
            "I had trouble reading the first fifty or so pages of this book. Shute's cadences are hard to get a handle on, and he has some awkward attributive tags on his dialogue. I initially had no sympathy for half the characters.I had trouble reading the last thirty pages of this book. Once I picked up the rhythm that Shute used to tell his story I became immersed in the world he created. The book changed from a post-apocalyptic science fiction novel to something greater. On the Beach transcends generic boundaries and becomes an elegy for the human race in an extinction that has not happened yet. I had trouble reading because of the tears in my eyes.On the Beach is one of the most emotionally powerful books I have read in a long time. After putting it down, I tried to reflect and determined it had been almost a decade, when I read Lawrence's _Sons and Lovers_ that I was so moved by a book. I have a tender heart, but this book is not emotionally manipulative in a transparent way that cheapens the effect. On the Beach is powerful because it asks and answers fundamental questions about our being in a way that is truthful to what it means t be human.Shute asks: \"What do we do in the face of death?\" He shows that we live as much as we can. We love. We make plans for the future. While we face death individually, we move towards it collectively. We are all cosigned to the same fate, but we do not have the certainty of the time that his characters do. On the Beach is an extended metaphor in a way, and as such is both an elegy and a celebration of what it means to be human. Sometimes that is beauty in the face of horror, and both come from the same root.",

            "Nevil Shute brings out the devastating truth of the victims of a nuclear war. The book is slow in the beginning, introducing characters and setting the plot, but less than half way throught the book I could not tear myself away. It is a clear picture presented to humanity about the devastion of a nuclear holocaust, and also brings in the thought of choosing one's own death.",
            "If you want to read a decent anti-war novel and you don't have much else to do on a gray and rainy day, pick this one up. It's somewhat dated, but at the same it speaks some truth about human behavior when faced with the end of the world.The characters' behavior isvery predictable. And they are somewhat one-dimensional cut-outs from the 50's-60's era. However, the reader is still captivated by the submarine crew's search for life in North America.",
            "This is a ver y good book about the end of the world. The characters are very real and the book is so realistic! Nevil Shute really did it this time. I caught myself sometimes slipping into a daze trying to figure out what I would do in they're situation. I had to read this book for required reading class a few years back. I had never heard of it but it was one of the only books left that looked good. I was a little apprehensive at first, but after a while, I couldn't put the book down. I must say I'll have to recomend this book to everyone!",
            "I have read few books as touching, as moving, as thought-provoking, and as terrifying as &quot;On The Beach&quot;. Needless to say, the message in this book will ring and resonate to everyone as long as we foolish, unwise humans have the power to destroy everything at our finger tips. Anyone that proclaims to be human must read this book. Although the scientific part is fairly incorrect, the human feeling of the book is as far-reaching as many other master pieces of literature have been. Absolutely magnificent!",
            "Unlike so many other science fiction authors, Nevil Shute brings the reader to a most horrifying point in mankind's history without shouting, and yet, after finishing the book, I found myself shouting in my own mind: &quot;Fools!&quot; A singularly powerful and timeless book.",

            "This book is so good because it shows what could have easily happened, and could still happen.",
            "My mother first recommended this book to me not long after I had seen the movie &quot;The Day After&quot;. I can rightly say that I have never been so emotionally gripped by a novel. I couldn't bear to ever put it down. Now, enough of my gushing, here's the real dirt on why this is one of the most phenomenal novels ever to tackle the subject of Nuclear War:It addresses the topic of a nuclear war not in the context of techno-thriller explosions, but in the context of the horror of is aftermath. Once all the political and military hotheads have finished blowing each other to pieces, all that is left to do is come to terms with the disaster and it implications (a topic made even more timely by the recent nuclear testings by India and Pakistan).The one aspect of &quot;On the Beach&quot; that had a profound emotional impact on me was how the last remaining survivors cope with reality of what has happened. Some panic, while others cling to the unrealistic hope that the disaster is not as bad as they thought. Soon, this all gives way to melancholy emotion of accepting the inevitable. While death is common in everyday life, it is tempered by the knowledge that life will go on. The saddest and most profound emotion Shute creates is the despair in knowing that after death, there will no longer be life.",
            "Nevil Shute's 'On the Beach' imagines mankind on the very verge of utter apocalypse, with only the population of southern Australia temporarily surviving the effects of a colossal nuclear war that has already extinguished human life in the Northern Hemisphere. Lethal levels of radioactive fall-out are spreading throughout the Southern Hemisphere and the characters have \"maybe\" three months to live when we are introduced to them, their life span dependent upon wind patterns and personal choices.Commander Dwight Towers, a U.S. submarine captain is the central character around whom Shute spins the intertwined stories of a ship's officer Peter Holmes and his wife Mary (along with their newborn); Moira Davidson, a pretty young woman; Moira's cousin John Osborne, a scientist/race car enthusiast; and a collection of other related persons in Melbourne (c. 1963) as they anticipate the extinction of man and, necessarily, their own deaths.The novel begins with an epigraph from T.S. Eliot's 'The Hollow Men', in part: \"We grope together/ And avoid speech/ Gathered on this beach of the tumid river ... This is the way the world ends ...\" A close reading of the poem will likely cast a distinct interpretation of the novel, different from the \"facing the end of the world with a stiff upper lip\" reading.Like the \"hollow men\" of Eliot's poem, the characters of Shute's 'On the Beach' confront mortality together, and yet alone. Their stories provide a range of choices (overwhelmingly influenced by deeply ingrained habits): from the path of duty and faithfulness to family, a final fling at a life's goal and the opportunity for grand achievement, or a good-faith effort to properly exhaust the club's supply of port!Published in 1957, 'On the Beach' recalls the immanent danger nuclear holocaust represented then (it continues to exist, its just that we have become inured to it), but also retains a certain civility in its representation of the Armageddon. We are not vividly told the details of horror and destruction, nor does the book dwell on the primitive behaviors modern cinema has conditioned us to expect under the circumstances. Although there is mention of those who abandon themselves to drinking or despondence in their final months, these portrayals are brief and remain on the periphery. Decency ... how quaint!The advantage of such decent characters is that it is easy to empathize with them, and to care about their fates (and to realize they represent the bulk of modern humanity). Shute is an effective storyteller and includes several sub-plots (like the main mission Towers and crew are assigned) that complement the meta-theme of confronting mortality.The quiet decency of the characters also serves to better relate to the \"hollow men\" of Eliot's poem. The characters largely occupy themselves with routine activities, while dwelling upon an imagined future that denies the pending end. Their daily activities mask their fundamental passivity. They await their certain death like the \"hollow men\" in the poem: \"We whisper together/ Are quiet and meaningless/ As wind in dry grass/ Or rats' feet over broken glass/ In our dry cellar.\"These are not persons who, in Dylan Thomas' words, \"Rage, rage against the dying of the light\" or, in Eliot's, resemble \"Those who have crossed with direct eyes.\" These are ordinary people continuing their ordinary lives, waiting \"on this beach of the tumid river\" to be ferried across by Charon, with possibly one exception. Commander Towers sets sail into the mists, seeking to do his duty to the end and to keep a metaphysical appointment with his family, a vaguely articulated reunion in an afterlife (in doing so he retains a sense of a human soul).The book seems like an extended tale based upon Thoreau's words, \"The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.\" Both Eliot's poem and the epigram of Shute's novel end with the words,This is the way the world endsThis is the way the world endsThis is the way the world endsNot with a bang but a whimper.'On the Beach' is an easy read, but difficult to put down and even harder to forget. In many ways its message is more haunting or unnerving than the violent telling of many imagined ends of the world.",
            "I read this novel as a young teenager, shortly after the Cuban Missile Crisis (when it briefly seemed quite possible a nuclear war with the Soviet Union might start at any moment). I cried a lot while I read it, especially at the end. The Aussies in it seemed more like rather stuffy Brits than like our concept of modern sporty outgoing energetic people.It's all about carrying on as normally and honorably as possible as the world of humanity quietly and slowly ends. I remember wanting them to stop being so passive, to get organized and fight to survive -- go to the deepest caves, stock them with necessities and seal them off for as long as it would take for the radiation levels to fall. But they go on doing their jobs, caring for their families, right to the end. I've seen a movie and a mini-series, and neither seemed to me to have the emotional punch of the book. I'm sure it's dated -- now space might be a possible escape route, and perhaps people just aren't as innocent and noble any more.",
            "This book gets my vote for the one most likely to make you want to jump off a bridge. The same, amazingly enough, can be said for the movie (starring Gregory Peck) which is a masterpiece in its own right. Don't get me wrong...the book is brilliant. Sol Stein--that great teacher of writers--counsels \"The reader is looking for an experience.\" Well, that's exactly what you get here. And it will leave you exhausted and not a bit horrified. I won't rehash the plot. You can get all of that you want from the other reviews and the official descriptions. And not to give any spoilers, but the most harrowing scene for me was the one where the young sailor is explaining to his wife her responsibilities should he not return from his submarine expedition to the poisoned North. As repeated before, the characters are all awaiting an impending and apparently unstoppable death, and the sailor tells his wife that if he doesn't return in time it will be the wife's task to administer the euthanasia drugs to their infant before she herself is overcome by radiation illness and unable to act. She responds hysterically, and refuses to do it. He calmly explains that if she fails she could perish before the infant does, and the child could be left alone, sick, and crying for hours or even days before death comes. She sees the light and agrees. Anyone who can read that scene and not be affected has a heart of stone, particularly if you've ever had a child of your own. The same scene in the movie is equally hard to watch. So if you like apocalyptic fiction, and you're looking for \"an experience\" then by all means read this book. It's one of the best. But don't say you weren't warned. I first read this book over thirty years ago and to this day I avoid it like the plague. Same for the movie. I don't know which is a more disturbing experience.",
            "Futuristic novels dealing with life after man's cruelty to man devastation through nuclear spill out ordinarily depict men as beasts in anarchy and don them names like Mad Max. Such is not this novel.Instead, this novel takes a really different perspective of an awful event. It is a love story amid the tropics of Australia among soldiers and demoiselles, and all in the light of love to which not one scene involves illicit sexual contact, or even context.Written primarily for dialogue, this is more a screenplay than novel. The characters are rich and pure, and the flippant Moira's flirtatious remarks and cunning witticisms make the otherwise stark and droll man-in-her eye, Cmdr. Dwight Towers, acceptable. She carries almost all scenes, and her positive attitudes in life or world measured by months, then weeks, then hours, are true to the end.Although I may have given away the ending, this story is really aTitanicon an epic proportion. Love can grow even in the worst moments in man's history. And, even the little palpitations of certain people's hearts are worth reading about - and are more fun than having someone spew for countless pages about the reasons why man would destroy all humanity. And, to Nevil Shute's credit, he rarely discusses why or never philosophizes about how come. Instead, this is a man meets girl, man \"kind of\" gets girl (and vice versa), and man and girl lose each other and selves . . . story.The Australian relaxed atmosphere of enjoying life to the fullest adds to the contrarian view of this seemingly morbid topic. To the end, the people engage in sports and have outings for the simple reason that these events are what men and women live for.Surprised by the novel, except the inevitability of the ending, this book compares to his other great novelA Town Like Alice. Now I need to rent this movie which I can only imagine follows the book which is tailored so well for the wide screen",
            "What would you do if you knew that, in 6 months, everyone you know would be dead? That every human being on this planet would be dead? That every animal on this planet would be dead?Would you go to work? Plan on the birth of a child? Plant a tree that won't produce fruit for five years? Follow the fishing rules? Would you make sure your cows would be fed in the weeks following your death? Worry about marriage? Drink yourself into oblivion? Would your feelings toward religion or nationality change? Would you accept a check for a purchase? Would garbage be collected? Would you start college?Would you decide to end life on your own terms?In On The Beach, by Nevil Shute, these questions and others must be addressed. There was a war. It really doesn't mattered who started it, or why. The result is that many areas in the northern hemisphere were turned into radioactive wastelands, and a planet-wide plume of dangerous radioactive particles is slowing, but surely, covering every square inch of the planet.There is no escape. The fatality rate is 100%. The plume will eventually reach 100% of the human population. As radio signals stop transmitting, survivors can predict the location of the deadly plume and its proximity to them. As certain as the sun rises and sets, the plume continues its journey.This is the story of the humans left alive in one of the last places on Earth untouched by the radioactive plume: Melbourne, Australia. An American submarine captain, an Australian navy commander and his wife, a local woman living with her father on his farm, and a CSIRO scientist with a passion for fast cars have their lives, and deaths, intertwined.This book was written in the 1950s, and the Cold War was in full bloom. Shute mixes the pessimism of any future with the nobility of the human spirit. You will be depressed, and your mind will be pleading for another ending, any kind of miracle, a technological advance, or a safe haven that will allow these kind people to live.There is no escape. The deadly radioactive plume has no intelligence, no soul. No United Federation of Planets appears to save humanity from themselves.Humbling, sobering, and haunting. How would I behave?I hope I never have to know...",
            "This book is beautiful, beautiful in a sad and heart wrenching way... like finding a dead butterfly. The world is winding down; an all out nuclear war has ravaged and wiped out the entire northern hemisphere. Those who weren't claimed by the bombs themselves died from the radiation. The southern hemisphere waits patiently for their time, as the radiation sweeps slowly southward, taking with it town after town.In southern Australia the last of the large cities prepares for their demise. One of two remaining American Nuclear Submarines has made it and it's crew reports in to the Australian Armed forces.This book mainly follows two men, Peter Holmes an Australian in the Navy who is a new father, and Dwight Towers, an American Commander of the Submarine \"Scorpion,\" a refugee in Australia. Peter is assigned to Dwight's submarine as the Australian Liaison, however the military aspect of this novel is truly nothing but background. This is a book about people, who know that death is swiftly approaching through the air and that there is nothing they can do to stop it. At the start of the book it is December 27th, and the radiation is due to reach them in September. We follow several members of the town as they work to go on with their daily lives all the while knowing that everything will be ending. Some live in a state of denial, planting gardens they will not live to see bloom, others attempt to live out what fantasies they can, racing fast cars with reckless abandon. Still others accept what is coming and live their lives the best they can.This is a story of quiet desperation, terror, acceptance and the decision to die with dignity. The writing style is fine, though not brilliant, perhaps this is because of the time it was written in, or perhaps Shute's idea was grander than his literary ability. Some of the words were awkward, which I simply attributed to my not knowing Australian slang, also many of the male characters can come across as fairly detached while the women verge on a touch of insanity. I contribute this to the fact that it was written in the 1950's when the men were expected to be both strong and reserved, and the women were still considered the \"weaker sex.\" There is also a deep rooted sense of morality and duty that courses through the novel, there is no looting, rioting, or mass pandemonium, rather we see a quite resolve, camaraderie and sense of dignity.Many have said this novel brought them to tears, though I can see my mom bawling if she read this, I did not cry, instead I found myself feeling empty, disturbed, and emotionally drained. There is no action in this book, save a car race, so if you are looking for fighting, explosions, and mutilations, look elsewhere. This is instead a powerful study of what those last days could be like. I wish they made books like this required reading in school, the next generation might think a little harder.",
            "I believe the premise of this book is excellent, but the execution of the idea leaves something to be desired. The novel begins after a worldwide nuclear war has just ended. The bombs hit in the now completely destroyed northern hemisphere. People are still alive in the southern hemisphere but have only a few months left until the fallout makes its way south. So basically, the books asks, what do you do, how do you behave, when you know that everyone left on Earth has only a few months left?The book takes place in a town in Australia. Dwight Towers is an American naval officer who has been blended in with the Australian navy since the American Navy is all but gone from the war. He is given command of a submarine which goes out on missions to find signs of life and measure radiation levels. He becomes friendly with an Aussie officer who introduces him to a local girl. The girl's job is to keep Towers' mind off of his now dead wife and children. The Aussie officer is married with a small child. He and his wife try to keep life as normal as possible from day to day.I love the premise of the book, but it's not all-together fascinating in its style. There are parts that I couldn't stop reading. But other parts dragged on with little happening. It's also true that Shute isn't the greatest writer in the world. Point of view or even location sometimes shifts from one paragraph to another which can be jarring. On the Beach is a great idea, but couldn have been written better.",
            "How would you live today if you knew, for a cold absolute fact, that you and everyone else was going to die tomorrow? No escape, no chance for escape, what would you do?'Not with a bang, but with a whimper'. The genius of this book, to me, is the description of the small events that make this book such a classic. The pogo stick, the bench for the lawn, the drinking of 6,000 bottles of excellent Port all open a door to these characters' souls,the reasons for continuing to live when there simply is no future to live for. The cross section of humanity in this book face the end, their end, with a majesty and a grace that is both inspiring and humbling as a triumph of the human spirit in the face of overwhelming annihilation.The book was written in the 50's and it has dated a little bit. But in so many ways, its appeal is timeless. Anyone can visualize the absolute horrors (and the folly of 'winning') of a thermonuclear war with the contemplation of the simple act of injecting a radiation sick infant child with poison, especially your own. Kindness is two little pills in a red box. Everybody dies, but the manner of their dying is theirs' to decide. This book is simply a classic.",
            "Shute's 1957 best seller about the grim danger of nuclear war which stalks man's very existence will shake up the most complacent reader. Written during the Cold War, it is a stirring plea for sanity among governmental superpowers, for they alone have the dreaded capability to actually destroy the world. Yet the plot develops with sincere concern for the Human aspect of this horrific catastrophe. Starkly chilling the story chronicles the last six months of Life on our planet for the people living and stationed in Australia-the southernmost section, near Melbourne. By the time the novel opens, nuclear war has wiped out human life in the entire Northern Hemisphere; it is just a matter of time before global winds shift patterns to carry the radioactive cobalt particles into the Southern Hemisphere. Annihilation by gradual but inexorable Contamination, which is our own fault!.How humanity copes with impending and inevitable death make a sobering tale; each character demonstrates his/her own foibles, suffers denial phases, and invents ways to deal with the end-not only of their own lives, but all human kind on the planet. Readers will mourn not just the character whom we come to care about, but also the needless and painful fate of man. The animals would survive longer, but eventually succumb to the poisoned air, water and vegetation. By the time Earth would again be habitable (20 years hence) there would be no humans alive to enjoy or revive it. Not because of an alien invasion or an act of God, but because of our own arrogant and bellicose stupidity.Dwight Towers is the highest ranking US Naval officer, currently commanding one of the last two submarines; still considering himself married and a family man, he does everything by the book-Navy to the end. Australia has ordered native Peter Holmes to serve as Liaison Officer for Dwight as the ship explores, with great circumspection, the remains of the deserted US and other coastal area which have gone silent. Peter's wife, Mary, is concerned mainly about their little house in the country and their young baby. Her girlfriend, Moira, is invited to a party to help keep Dwight occupied; seems it's difficult for Northern Hemisphere types to keep their cool in Australia, where life still maintains some degree of normalcy. John Osborne is a scientist assigned to check the levels of radiation during the two-month recon cruise, though he would much prefer to enjoy his private pride--a Ferrari--while he sill can. One by one our friends succumb to death by radiation sickness--many opting to take a cyanide pill calmly in their favorite settings. One of which proves to be on the beach.This terrifying cautionary tale reveals man's futile attempts to salvage the future which he unthinkingly destroyed;the dark plot development focuses on the last efforts of humanity to preserve the dignity of the species and its once bright accomplishments.",
            "I read this book one September years past. I felt at the time that the dignity and civility of the civilitation were the main fictional elements in the book. I have no faith that we would have power, water or food to the end. But I liked that world better and wanted it saved more that the current one. It was a book that made you take time to look at family, friends and your tiny world to examine its fragile nature and listen to a bird sing. Read it and you will remember it in 2010.",
            "Wow, very good book. A glimps back at the paranoia of the eary 60's at the beginning of the arms race. I kept thinking 'why don't they go underground?' and I remembered that during the first part of the cold war people were told to Duck and Cover, the general public did not know about radiation. In other words they didn't know what we know know. A very good look back.",
            "A marvelous novel relating, indeed evincing, the imminent perils of nuclear war and the immanent hamartia of humankind, deplorably destined perhaps to suicidal massacre. Nevil Shute's literary artistry is particularly manifest in how he superbly hews His characters, weaving them into truly believable forms that serve to illuminate inscapes into those things We all share, We all feel. With the setting, they draw You inexorably into their world, Your world, a pending situation so threatening, so real, that ignorance is obviated and altogether impossible. Mr. Shute presents such a credible story of verily apocalyptic proportions on a general, mundane scale, and of cataclysmic complexities on a personal, emotional level, something with which We can all relate. It is an extraordinary novel, not only recommended by me, but advocated, i trow, by human nature and tendencies collectively. Yeah, it's really that good",
            "****Some Spoilers Follow****\"On the Beach\" promises a riveting account of the last survivors on Earth after a nuclear holocaust. These last survivors know that deadly fallout will come to claim their lives and their only hope is a stranded submarine captain and his crew. While being strikingly original for its time, the book ends up being a dreary exercise in dignity and hopelessness.My biggest complaint is that Shute's characters lack any color and fail to generate any empathy as they fret about their ordinary lives. Much like wooden pop-up targets at a shooting gallery, Shute's characters appear and reappear just to give a few mundane lines and then fade away until they are needed again. They talk about milk, Pogo sticks, playpens, alcohol, gardening, racing, etc. while the End of the World creeps ever closer and closer to them. Thus, the book's inevitable conclusion fails to affect the reader just as it is hard to feel sorry for pieces of cardboard.On a plus note, Shute really knows his technical details when it comes to a submarine lifestyle and nautical navigation. Unfortunately, Shute's maddeningly simplistic writing style fails to paint any atmosphere of, well...anything.Luckily, imitation is the highest form of flattery; several contemporary books expand on Shute's nuclear vision with much more energy, realism and humanism. I recommend aA Canticle for LiebowitzandAlas, Babylon (Perennial Classics)for more enjoyable and thought-provoking EOTW reads.",
            "I recently began reading \"end of the world\" related novels, and \"On the beach\" was quickly on my list. I had seen the original movie several years ago. I thought it was a good film and I was excited to read the novel. To say the least, I was disappointed. The premise of the story is a good one with interesting possibilities, however the author could not bring it to life for me. There is no real plot. There is no action, drama or intrigue. Basically it about a group of \"ordinary\" people waiting to die from radiation poisoning. So, that makes it a character study, which is fine except that all the characters are poorly drawn and uninteresting. I have not read anything else by Nevil Shute, but his style of drawing characters here is much like a 1930s - 1950s B-movie screenwriter. I have a hard time believing that people really talked like that. I know it is a different country and a different time, but I have read other contemporary novels written during this same era and this novels characters compare very poorly. I could not identify with any of the major characters. The only character who seemed to act with any passion and believable drive was Seaman Ralph Swain, who jumps ship in Seattle. At least he acted like someone who is still alive (ironically) instead of walking around in a daze of denial.I think this is a worthwhile read, however it is not a \"classic\". I can easily think of at least a half dozen other novels with similar themes that should be read before On The Beach.",
            "Plot Kernel - The people within a small town in Australia cope with the certainty that a nuclear war in the northern hemisphere has created enough radioactive fallout to blanket the Earth and annihilate all animal life upon it. It is only a matter of weather currents and time before they too will fall ill and die.",
            "On the Beach by Nevil ShuteThe book begins with Australian Lt. Cmdr. Peter Holmes being recalled to active duty. Then we learn that there is no oil or gasoline after a short war in the Northern Hemisphere. People travel by horse or bicycle now. Brown coal alone provides electricity. Holmes will be liaison officer on the USS Scorpion, an atomic-powered submarine that discovered lethal radiation at all American naval bases; there is no radio contact with the USA. They're all silent! The Russian-NATO war was followed by a Russian-Chinese war, then by an Israeli-Arab war. Only Australia remained, until the radioactivity arrived there. Holmes visits the submarine and invites Commander Dwight Tower USN to visit his home. The winds carry radioactive dust, and radiation sickness is beginning to appear. Its so unfair.The book tells of their lives. The local church is packed. The Scorpion will travel to check the radiation levels in the northern ports. The empty streets are swarming with people, dancing and drinking like there's no tomorrow. Business is slowing down, people are working less or out of a job. When the submarine visits Port Moresby, Cairns, and Port Darwin they see no people; they're ghost towns. Chapter 3 tells of the surprise attacks and miscalculations that started the war. The ports along the eastern seaboard of America were dangerous to explore because of the sea mines around the harbors. In Chapter 4 the submarine will explore the west coast of America to test if the radioactivity is subsiding. The effects of radioactivity on a body is similar to the effects of cholera. There is no cure. The Government plans to hand out free suicide pills!Shute uses subtle humor to mock Holmes' attitude about women: \"living in a sentimental dream world\" (Chapter 5)! The submarine travels to Washington state and visits Edmonds, 15 miles north of Seattle. They're all dead (Chapter 6). Life went on, but fuel for fires and little luxuries became scarce. Now motorcars appeared on deserted roads (Chapter 7). Some have saved petrol, but now the problem is tires. Money decreased in value and importance; it was the goods they bought that was important. (What happened to productivity?) Their Grand Prix for racing cars symbolized the bleak future. Does alcohol increase the tolerance to radioactivity (Chapter 8)? There is a meeting in Melbourne. Holmes notices a number of absences (Chapter 9). This chapter tells about the end of the characters in this novel. They suffer from radiation sickness, then take the suicide pills handed out as the last gift from The Best and The Brightest. Those who say it was a miscalculation never read Machiavelli as to the effects of fortune on human activity.This is all so unfair! You would hope the primitive peoples in North and South America, Europe, Africa, and Asia would somehow survive. The film of this prophetic novel was a justified success, and warned and educated the public about the dangers of radioactivity. A few years later there was a treaty to ban nuclear testing above the ground. The spread of science allowed many countries to create nuclear reactors, as they did with cannon and guns in earlier ages. Will the warning in this novel ever be forgotten?Note on the Comment. The original Amazon Editorial Review on this book mentioned the mass doom of people around the world. \"They are the last generation, the innocent victims of an accidental war, living out their last days, making do with what they have, hoping for a miracle. As the deadly rain moves ever closer, the world as we know it winds toward an inevitable end....\"",
            "I don't read a lot and i don't like many books but this book is truly amazing! It is very emotional. The end is shocking. I really recommend it.",
            "The book On The Beach was an exciting and intense book. It was a book on life after nuclear bombs were dropped. In this book they were dropped in the northern hemisphere. It was an intense book because you didn't know what was going to happen next. I enjoyed On The Beach because I expected something dull to happen every time I turned the page, but something completely different happened. It was enjoyable not only for it's suspense but also for the love shared between the characters. They cared for each other enough to ask them to kill themselves if the radiation got to bad. If you want to know what life would be like after a nuclear war, read this book. If you support it you will probably change your mind. This book might even improve your vocabulary. I highly recommend this book.",
            "This 1950s novel tells a very simple story. After a nuclear war has devastated the Northern Hemisphere (who knows how it started), the people of Australia have seven to eight months to live, while the radioactivity drifts into the Southern Hemisphere. As the radiation slowly advances, they die, either by messy radiation poisoning, or by their own hands. Somewhere in between, the characters try to cope with their own mortality.Why does this book stand out? Certainly not because the characters are believable, but because it broke new ground in the literary world. Written some fifty years ago, during the Cold War, it paints a vivid and bleak picture of humanity's last days from an Australian perspective, where everyone dies. It holds up the specter of what could happen.Given that this book was written in a time when the Civil Defense was prompting civilians to build bomb shelters, &quot;duck and cover,&quot; and to resume a normal life after a nuclear event, this book seems groundbreaking in retrospect.",
            "This has to be one of the most boring and stupid books i have ever read. The movie wasn't any better either.The people just give up and die. That might be exciting if the characters were developed and the plot was interesting. If you think about reading this, you may want to sit under some nuclear fallout first to lesson the agony of reading this worthless drivel",
            "I recently had to read this book as part of my senior English curriculum, and I must say, it is one of the worst books I have ever read. It is poorly written, with each page filled with mind-numbing drivel that is either part of a huge run of dialogue alone or description alone.I really had high hopes for this book, as the plot seemed intriguing, in that post-nuclear war sort of way. I was completely wrong however, as the nuclear setting actual factors into the book suprisingly little. It is pretty much structured like this: People in Australia generally go about their everyday lives for about 200 pages, and then all of a sudden- everyone starts getting sick! Of course, there are only about 70 pages where this happens, so really it plays a minor role. Of course, that is excusable, as this book is mainly a character study of a variety of people and their different reactions to the end of the world. This might have worked had the reactions been more varied than: A. \"We're all believe we are going to die, let's do what we want.\" or B. \"I don't believe I will actually die. Let's do what we always do.\"Also, it does not help the book that Nevil Shute is really a terrible writer. Why does each character need like 20 epithetical names? Why is Peter Holmes referred to as Holmes, Peter, the Australian, the liason, the lieutenant (or whatever his rank was), the young man, the young father, and a whole host of other names? Couldn't Shute have just said Holmes and left it at that? Also, the sheer amount of repetition in the language is amazing and the dialogue is terrible, sad, since it makes up so much of the book.Here is a nice phrase: \"She oughtn't to keep crying like this ought she? Do you think we ought to get in Dr. Halloran?\"\"I shouldn't think so,\" Peter said.At least shute simply used \"Peter\" there...While some people may like this book- worship it even- I simply felt that it was WAAAAAY too boring. This is the only book I have EVER read that has literally put me to sleep every time I picked it up. I am not joking, and I read a lot of books. The book simply doesn't feel like what it is- an end-of-the-world drama, weaving the tales of the thoughts and dreams of the survivors of the blast. Instead, the book usually reads like a poorly written Great Gatsby, full of drunken parties and annoying people overstaying their welcome. Avoid this book like radiation sickness, please, for your sake and the sake of others.",
            "This book is not for seniors in high school. Educators need to find more interesting things to read about.",
            "Mr. Shute had a wonderful scenerio for the end of the world in his book. Now if only he had given the idea to an author who knew how to write. This novel moved excrusiatingly slow and his repetitve australian dialect added nothing to help; if not hurt it. Out of all the books I have read, I would have to say that this one ranks among the top 10 worst in language usauge and sentence structure.",
            "Review: I rate On the beach 1 1/2 stars. On the Beach is one of the most boring and repetitious books I have ever read in my entire life. Each successive chapter is much like the one before it, in terms of mood and feeling. The overall feeling is one of such utter hopelessness and depression that it seemed to make me almost regret reading it in the first place. The only reason that allows me to be glad that I wasted my time reading this book, is that I now know never to read it again. If you are interested in reading about hopelessness, read Dante's Inferno, or Slaughter House 5, or The Green Mile, or the first book of The Stand. I promise you that those books will be far more interesting and meaningful than On The Beach. This book is about the end of the world, and yet there is very little symbolism of any kind, religious, philosophical or otherwise. On the whole, this book was very shallow and each chapter left me with little new to think about, much less discuss. On The Beach was meant to be a kind of anti-war warning, but other than that, it is about as puddle on a barely degraded roadway. There is some interesting characterization yes, but many of the characters seemed fairly dull despite how ever much time was spend on them. I would have to be paid 90 dollars to ever want to read this book again. In many ways this book struck me as more boring than The Complete Journals of Lewis and Clark. On The Beach should have been written as a short story, not a full size book. A short version of On the Beach would have spared me of its terrible multi-doses of boredom while still effectively conveying its plot and feeling.",
            "This is a horrible book. The characters are so preditable and the plot is so boring and uneventful. Nevil Shute has written a lot of good books, but this is definatly not one of them. If this page had a 0 star option, I would've given it that rating.",
            "This is not well written. It is the slowest moving, one of the most boring post apocalyptic books I have ever read. Very disappointed and definitely will NOT recommend this book to anyone I like. Bought it on reviews found here. Will not trust THAT anymore!",
            "ok well how can i start, i go to a private school in SUrrey B.C and im unfortunatly forced to read this book as a novel for our english class. what can i say it [is bad]! the characters just dont do logical things! ok if u knew the world was ending in less then a year would you just pretty much ignore it.. go on a submarine for half the time and forget about everything that was happening and not even try and save yourself? no, of course not. human nature is to survive! not to be willing to die and just deal with it... its human nature to stand up and try and not give up. obviously mr shute didnt know that while writing this book. He is very sexist towards woman and his style of writing is QUITE borring, i did NOT enjoy this book.",
            "This Book, if you can call t that, was absolutely horrible. It took me over a year to finally get through, and I hated every last minute of it!I have read otehr &quot;End of the Worlld&quot; novels, including Larry Niven's &quot;Lucifer's Hammer&quot; which was grand, but this book was just boring and non-climatic. Sure, while an interesting view of the possible end of the world is shared with us, it was boring, meticulous and just plain rather acking any interesting plot line. If you have been drawn in to reading this book, stop now, don't even consider buying it, it's really not worth it! You can have my copy if you want to read it that bad!",
            "Well, we had to read this book in English class. It is supposedly a classic, but many of the members of my class agree with me that it does not deserve its award winning title. First of all the characters in the book have very odd relationships, not resembling those of real people. Secondly, human nature is to protect oneself and its offspring. All the characters in the novel are taking their death as it comes, but if they were smart they could build underground shelters, stay there for 5-10 years and then return to the surface when the radiation has lessened. All in all it was a bit of a dissapointment, however the movie is very well done and I would recommend that first and foremost before the book.",
            "After being forced to read this my junior year of high school in English class, one of my friends hated it so much that he wrote a song called \"Nevil Shute Can Kiss My *#&.\" And my mother was so scarred after seeing the movie version as a young girl that she gets the creeps whenever she hears the song \"Waltzing Matilda.\" Be that as it may, this remains one of my favorite books.Set in Australia, the book opens with a horrific situation--the rest of the world has been wiped out due to nuclear warfare, and Australians, who were completely innocent in the skirmish which touched off the world's destruction, are the last people alive in the last non-radioactive zone in the world. Unfortunately for them, the winds are slowly carrying radioactive particles further and further into the southern hemisphere, and the residents of the continent are simply waiting for the poison to bring certain death. Depressing? Sure. A chilling warning of what could happen to the human race if just one person pushes that proverbial red button? Absolutely.Nevil Shute does a great job developing the characters and making you identify with them, from a young married couple with a new baby and a lonely young single woman to an American officer who just happened to be in his submarine with his crew when the war broke out, thus saving their lives and forcing him and his crew to live with the knowledge that everyone they love is gone and their hometowns are uninhabitable. This story brings the reality of nuclear war home, and is as relevant in this day and age as it ever was.",
            "I have read this book twice, first when I was twelve years old and then again recently at the age of twenty-seven. After fifteen years of reflection, I remembered this book both fondly and fearfully - fondly for the quality of its writing and the importance of its message and fearfully for the horrible picture it presents of one of many virtually unthinkable scenarios of the nuclear age. So I read it again and experienced a renewal of the same sense of awakening to the frightening world that we live in.Although the specific course of events depicted in this book is unlikely to ever occur in the real world, the story does present characters with the sorts of personal struggles that would likely face millions in the event of a widespread modern use of nuclear weapons. For example, the sense of helplessness experienced by the characters is a particularly moving theme that may inspire readers to greater political participation and interest in international affairs. In short, I think this is an important book, particularly for young adults whose views of the world and of their responsibilities in it are not yet as fixed as those of older generations.",
            "On the Beach is a marvelous novel it captures one of the greatest fears of the twentieth and the twenty-first century, nuclear war. Nevil Shute has done a great job of describing different ranges of characters. He has used single, married, and divorced characters. The basic theme of the novel was that everyone was going to die and the world as we know it will come to a devastating end. Although the theme has been used before in several novels this time it is written in a different style. Nuclear war in the Northern Hemisphere has caused so much damage (radiation) that it is now slowly moving to the Southern Hemisphere who are going to be innocent victims. Mr. Shute makes sure he gets the point across that that the war has caused many innocent victims. The only flaw in this novel is that it focused too much on the military making it slow at times. On the Beach is a great fiction novel that informs the reader of the possible future.",
            "On The Beach was a good book, although I thought the characters reaction to the coming radioactive winds was unrealistic. Many just stayed at home on their porches drinking a last drink or lying in bed. I for one would be running for Tasmania and eventually Antartica (if it wasint too cold). Maybe I havent lived in one place long anough to have and regets of leaving a lifetime home. But still, you hear about the thousands of refugees from war zones, it seems unlikeley hardly anyone would run from certain, and painful, death. The story was intruiging anyway and I recommend it for a good reader (some of the English terms and styles of writing are confusing). PS: Look up the definition of a fortnight before you read this :)",
            "I give this book 5 stars even though the writing style is fairly poor and the scientific theory is questionable. That is because the subject matter, and the way the author handled it, was stunning. First of all, writing as he was in a time when everyone thought one of the superpowers would push the button, he was uncannily accurate in his hypothesis that if total destruction ever happens, it will be caused by renegade smaller countries. More importantly, his variation on the theme of everyone living lives of quiet desperation, but here with a terribly fixed time limit, was bone-chilling. And it was the simplicity of the characters that made this book so poignant and thought provoking. One of the top 10 books I've ever read.",
            "i gave this book 5 stars even though the actual writing style left something to be desired. The subject matter of the book, and the way it is treated, however, make this one of the best books i've ever read. His vision of how the world might end seems uncannily prophetic, since he posits a situation where it was renegade groups in small countries that caused the whole thing, which is what would probably happen if there ever was world destruction. Also, the notion of a whole country going on with life as usual, but knowing its days are numbered and there is nothing that can be done was quite compelling. An unforgettable read.",
            "Shute's &quot;On The Beach,&quot; while an interesting character study on the aftereffects of nuclear war on a fairly remote population of people, makes for interesting reading, but is not especially outstanding in the realm of post-nuclear literature. The inevitability of the characer's demise leads them to dealing with their situation in many different ways, each of which is realistic and thought-provoking (what would YOU do?) but this book stands more as a study of human psychology in extreme conditions rather than one of the truly great &quot;nuke/mass disaster&quot; novels.Shute's writing, however, is fantastic and his characters fully believable. The fact that the book is rather short on much except conversation and character development sections more or less shows where its interests lie. This book is definately more for the intellectual interested in the effects of impending doom on people rather than the thrill-seeker looking for a graphic description of nuclear war.",
            "Nevil Shute creates a realistic portrayal of life after nuclear war and the psychological dilema of facing death. I liked the story and the writing was pretty good - save that Shute was not the greatest action writer. The story is classic and though it is pretty depressing, it made me value the little things in every day life. It reminds you to live for today knowing tomorrow may never come.",
            "I think the reason I was so emotional over this book was because when I read it, the threat of nuclear war was weighing on us every day. Years later, I still remember it vividly. It was so chilling, even more so than any horror novel. I felt very lucky to be alive and appreciated my life much more after reading it.",
            "I read this book 5 years ago and I still remember the story like yesterday! It's books like this one that should be required reading in school. It was truely a wonderful story that will keep you interested until the end.",
            "Faulkner nailed it. The plot of Shute's book is as timely as it was in the late 50's. Why? How?Why should you spend under $5 for a used copy from Amazon?What Shute wrote about is going to happen!The 'nuk-ler' secret, to quote the only President the US has, now, is in the hands of a dozen or more countries, many of them angry at great parts of the world. Few know that apartheid South Africa had 'the bomb'.There's an inevitability of atomic bombs, again, being used in war. It will happen.But, we face a slightly different end of civilization than Shute envisioned. Solid circuits, computers, banking, automobiles, cash registers, McDonald's, will disappear in the first flash, ElectroMagnetic Pulse, EMP. How far away? In the early 60's, long before today's circuits were envisioned, an H-Bomb test 800 miles from Hawaii blew out gadgets from circuit breakers to street lights. Luckily, we don't know the exact answer. Yet.A. Einstein was asked what WW III would be fought with. He didn't know. He DID know what WW IV would be fought with. \"Rocks.\"'Brother, it's not too late.' (that's the banner at a Salvation Army rally ... also the last image in the movie.)Read the book, it'll make you think. A half century later, its theme is almost inevitable.It'll make you think. That's rare in books these days. Even more for books written 50 years ago.",
            "This book was a great read, it was nearly impossible to put it down. I would not suggest anyone who is looking for a happy ending to read this book, but if you are someone who wants a well written, well thought out and an extreamly great story to read, this would be the book for you. While reading the book you actually feel that you are there alongside the characters. When you finish the book you will most likely appreciate life more and you will see the world a bit differently.",
            "It almost never works that a book as depressing as this is a cure for depression, but in this case it is just that. The end, while vile and disgusting, remains dignified and almost beautiful. That is what makes this such a perfect read. When you put down the book you cannot help but ask yourself what you would do if you had six months to live, and then three months, then a matter of weeks, days and hours. You take comfort in the new understanding in our world about nuclear disaster, and are chilled at what is still out there.This book brings your emotions crashing into a pit of despair, and after reading it you inevitably re-evaluate your life. I have bought over fifty copies of this book and given them away to people who seemed to need it.",
            "Australian author Nevil Shute's harrowing tale of the end of the world, but not without abundant humanity, feeling, and love. Written at the height of the cold war, it's more akin to a science fact drama than science fiction or fantasy.I have not seen the 1959 movie version with Gregory Peck &amp; Ava Gardner but do recommend the 2000 TV movie starring Armand Assante &amp; Rachel Ward. As usual, my suggestion would be to read the book first. The latter film takes place in 2006, not in the 1960's.SideBar: Does driven technological development and an unbalanced reliance upon scientific tools lead to an individual or group mindset that playing with Pandora's Box never has irreversible consequences?",
            "We need more books like this one. Its tone of finality is refreshing. From the very beginning we know the world is coming to an end...at least for us humans. True, we are given some small measure of hope with the exploration of the nuclear submarine in the already deadly atmosphere of the United States. But even that is less of a hope than a tour of what is coming to the remainder of civilization huddled in Australia.If you liked this type of book read &quot;Thinning The Herd&quot;, a new book which follows in its footsteps...ISBN 0971303207.",
            "On the Beach by Nevil Shute is one of many post-apocalyptic novels conceived during the Cold War. The story is not, however, set in one of the countries that was a major figure in the nuclear arms race, but in Australia where, following an atomic armageddon that engulfed most of the rest of the world, a nation awaits the global airstreams to bring upon them the lethal fall-out let loose by massive nuclear detonation. Some turn to alcohol and other vices; some follow their usual routines, denying the inevitable poisoning and some vow to live each remaining moment to its fullest. It is certainly an interesting premise. Sadly, Mr. Shute proves himself unfit to explore it aptly.I was surprised to read that the author had written more than a dozen novels before On the Beach because the book is so amateurish. Unimportant details are given overwhelming emphasis, use of description to color a scene is basically absent, and never is the novel given any noticeable tone. On the Beach would have benefited greatly from a major revision, one that would perhaps add some flavor and depth to it. With so many stronger post-apocalyptic novels still in print (A Canticle for Liebowitz by Walter Miller Jr., Earth Abides by George R. Stuart, The Last Ship by William Brinkley, Alas Babylon by Pat Frank) this monotonous, poorly written book should be disregarded.",
            "The book was extremely powerful and very haunting. I didn't read it, I heard it on audio book, read with absolute brilliance by Simon Prebble. A couple of very minor irritants were, as another reviewer observes, the peculiarity of strangely switching from Miss - to 'honey', and I thought the grand prix event went on too long. I suppose it had some allegorical significance, but i'm not exactly sure what that was, or maybe Mr Shute just loved Ferraris and auto racing. Minor complaints though. Great book. It will stay with me.",
            "If you are looking for twists and turns in a wild plot this isn't the book. Go back save yourself. Work in your garden. Live. However if you want a book that has some profound capability to incite empathy, this is the book. I don't know how Nevil Shute did it, but some how this author was able to paint a picture of a world about to end, and how humans react to this. The stoics will feel their eyes shrink-wrapped in tears, the emotional will cry uncontrollably, and paranoia will ensue. The one day I didn't read On the Beach, I had a dream I was in the same situtation as in the book except time had run out. How I reacted, how my loved ones reacted provided an insight in this dream that was truly enlightening. That has to be a good book, rarely does a book infiltrate my dreams. This book is a must read for all people and decesion makers that have the power of nuclear weapons. Shute is trying to teach us a lesson, let us not close our eyes and ears. Be outraged by nuclear policies.",
            "It's too bad that this book suffers so much from lackluster writing. The story is moving, engaging, and heartbreakingly sad. It really makes you wonder what you'd want to do if you know there were only a few weeks left, and how you would feel as the end approached. I found it very difficult to put this book down once I had begun, and very difficult to put it out of my mind once I had finished. The characters are real and believable - very important to a novel of this sort. While it is unfortunate that the author could have used a grammer manual, this is still a book well worth reading.",
            "&quot;On the Beach&quot;, in my mind, ranks with &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; and 1984&quot; as one of the truly great novels of the 20th century. Yes, it is a little dated; but world politics aside, this book has a power that is just astounding. I have never felt such empathy for characters in a book, as I do for the poor souls in Shute's Australia.The emotions in this book take my breath away. I could never do it justice here; suffice it to say, &quot;On the Beach&quot; may be the most incredible, powerful, moving book I have ever read.",
            "I picked this book up from the library and hesitiated to read it, partly because the cover was boring, but mostly because I thought I knew what was going to happen. When I started to read it I was immeditley captivated. The ending no longer mattered, only the story. This book is a great read, well worth the time. Perhaps one of the best that I've ever had the pleasure of reading.",
            "We were required to read &quot;On the Beach&quot; for our English class and thought it would a boring book. But, after I finshed I was shocked. How could we create such horrible weapons? If it were the end I think going out in a fireball on a race track would the best way to go.",
            "First off - the book is set in an alternate 1965 that didn't happen on our timeline. Then, the disaster mechanism is pretty messed up, even by what we knew about bomb effects in 1963. Global Thermonuclear War would not end up this way. It might be just as bleak, but not the way Shute describes. But...get past that, and look at it as a group of people facing slow, creeping, inexorable death and you get a gripping story. What would you do if you knew that you would die six months from now? That the only choices were to choose a slow,messy, painful death by radiation poisoning, or a faster death by some other means? Could you give your children poison to spare them a painful death? Would you live your life to the extreme, knowing that a flaming death in a race car was faster and more fun than the alternative? It's a grim story, with an unhappy ending, but it raises some good philosophical questions about how we live -- and how we die.",
            "This is a must read!!! Facinating book! Nevil Shute can realy put a scare into you if you beleive nuclear wars are not as far as you think!!!",
            "enjoyed this tale and still found my self immersed in this believable tale. especially as i am a child of the nuclear years and cold war hope people have the same concern for each other",
            "I really loved this book even if the end made me pretty sad.It was refreshing to see a story about the end of the world where people were just enjoying the time they had left instead of destroying eachother further at the end. I won't say more but what I will say is this book is worth the read.",
            "I just finished reading this book, and I have to say, for a slow paced post apocalyptic survival fiction, this was one of the most depressing books I have ever read",
            "i read it about 30 years ago and found it fasinating so i bought it , a Kindle version, again because i lent the paperback to somebody who never returned it and now to revive the spell.",
            "Nevil Shute writes well about the people of Australia (plus the crew of an American nuclear submarine) who wait calmly for the end of the world due to the spreading radiation poisoning from a nuclear war in the northern hemisphere. Some block the future, others don't believe it can happen, but most simply go about their lives as they wait for the end.",
            "On The Beach uses the backdrop of the post-nuclear war and the nuclear fallout as a premise but the novel is not about the war or the fallout. It's about the people living their lives with the knowledge of inevitable ending nearing. There isn't any preaching from Shute about social injustice or anti-war statements really. Instead Shute asks questions about how we would live our daily lives given the premise that we are all going to die and that we know the estimated time/day (and others have the same day/time). Of course the writing style and conversations are from the 1950's so it's a throwback to an era before cell phones or other modern electronics and focuses on conventional relationships with actual personal contact. Shute does a great job going into detail on the current lifestyle workarounds of the characters due to lack of gasoline and other necessities as Australia is the last remaining 1st world nation with electricity. Mostly the characters party, eat and drink, and socialize which in an imaginary impending doom scenario I guess we would all do. Pretty classic sci-fi end of the world apocalypse novel with a mid-20th century perspective.",
            "This is an interesting book, but for some reason, I find it hard to classify, and can't quite pin down why. Please bear with me.When reading this book, keep in mind that it was written almost 50 years ago. Social attitudes change over time, even during brief periods. For this reason, some people may find the character's behaviour odd.The book was also written shortly before the Cuban missile crisis. The tensions which led to the crisis were already in development, and the Cuban missile crisis was the boiling point for those tensions.The author takes those tensions into a world where diplomacy failed. I don't want to re-hash what many other reviewers have already discussed, but the novel is set in Australia about a year after \"the war\". Most of the details about the war are sketchy at best, altho the characters do have a general idea of what occured. What does occur is that a few of the characters are suffering from terrible rage against the powers which waged the war, in which they had no part, but for which all of humanity suffers.The novel details the final months of a group of people who are simply waiting for time to run out. Some have commented on the inanity of carrying on with daily life, especially since life (as they know it) will simply cease within a year. I don't think that is too far fetched. Even recent events show that in times of disaster, many people realize that the best thing to do is try to carry on as best as they could.Commerce and goverment are still operating, but as the novel winds to the sad end, so do these institutions, as well as all the rest...It's a sad interpetation of what could have happened. I also think it's a valid book to read, even long after the end of the Cold War. For me, those most haunting images are those of a submarine slowly sailing past cities which survived the blast, but which eventually fell to radiation poisioning.",
            "Despite its rather benign title, this novel will shock the reader with the opening chapter, outlining the causes and consequences of a global thermonuclear war. \"Total War\" is something that hardly crosses our mind as modern Americans these days, but in 1957 it was a very real fear, and a very real possibility. This novel is an extension of those fears and provides a warning as well. The story is set in Melbourne, Australia, and the basic premise is quite grim. The entire Northern hemisphere has been ultimately destroyed in a massive nuclear exchange. Great, well how does this affect the peaceful residents of Melbourne, the southernmost populous city on the continent? As a result of the war nuclear winds, massive storms laden with fallout haven begun to circle the earth and wind their way south. These storms will bring an inevitable end to all human life on earth, presumably all life period. The most touching aspect of this novel is that every character knows their demise is soon to come, but they accept the hand they were dealt (a rather shoddy one considering they had nothing to do with the war) with dignity and await their doom living out their daily lives in peace.This story is a very grim reality check and certainly a worthwhile read. The dialogue has a tendency to be fairly formulaic and contrived at some points; however the climax of the story is quite suspenseful. Overall a very good read, anyone with an affinity for political or global thrillers would enjoy this peek into the absurdity of the of the cold war, as written by one who lived through it.",
            "The end of the world is coming.The madness of nuclear war has consumed the Northern hemisphere and the ensuing radiation is seeping south to destroy Australia. The population attempt to deal with certain death in a variety of ways. Some deny it,drowning themselves in drink. Others live their lives to the fullest before the end. This book is a chronicle of how it could have been. The threat of total global destruction may be less now that the cold war is &quot;over&quot;, but the threat of nuclear disaster is still present, if only on a smaller scale.",
            "This definately isn't a light book, by any definition. The subject matter is depressing, but in a good way. It makes you want to jump up and find a hippie peace movement. This book makes you think long and hard about the choices humans have made, and where they might lead us. If, after reading this book, you've slid into a colossal blue funk, may I suggest &quot;The Celestine Prophecy&quot; by James Redfield, which offers a more optimistic view of the fate of humanity.",
            "This book is not for those of the action-packed \"post-apocalyptic\" genre. This is for those of us who like to think \"what if\" for more than mere entertainment. You won't find bullet-riddled car chases or fights, and only the barest mention of revelry. There's no sex. No real violence (save some auto racing). Nobody even seems to raise their voice that much.Perhaps that's why this book is so creepy. The ordinary, undramatic drama of living with the knowledge of impending death. People deal with this all the time, but rarely en masse -- cancer victims, AIDS sufferers, etc. In fact, our culture has tried very hard to erase the thought of death from our minds; it is deemed \"inaccessible\" to the plebean masses, something relegated to goths and the morbidly depressed.Truth is, we need shots of this in our society like we need polio vaccines. Ironically, our stress-induced illnesses, which bring death sooner, could be greatly alleviated if we stopped running from the idea that we're going to die. In a way, this book is an \"Ecclesiastes\" for the layperson and non-believer alike: it's a wake up call, reminding us each \"you're going to die; so what are you going to do about it till then?\"The difference is, in this book, they know WHEN it's going to happen. A mixed blessing, to say the least, but one we can benefit from if we will just swallow that bitter pill (no in-joke intended here).As an anxiety-prone perfectionist high-achiever, I *need* books like this to scrub off the worry and preoccupation and guilt over personal failures. I *need* to be reminded that life is about more than achievement - we all live as if our careers, social status, accomplishments, and expectations are the reason for living. But if we knew we were shortly to die, how much would those things matter? How much anxiety would just drop off of us if life became about more than achievement and distraction, about more than frenzied activity and chemical relaxants?Books such as this, while not giving us complete answers, do help to point the way.",
            "It took me 60 pages to realize this book had been written over forty years ago; and then, only at the casual mention of a date. I found just about every issue in this book to be one of today also. The threat of nuclear weapons, wars in far away countries, and the viewpoints of the people. This book is timeless, and will continue to be so until nuclear weapons are completely lost or we blow ourselves up.The characters seemed very real. Their reactions to the forcasted time when radiation sickness was to strike were varied and extremely interesting. I was especially intrigued by the widespread instinct towards something like conscious denial, i.e. the planting of gardens for the following spring and such. I found the basic tone of this book to be similar to 1984, though not focused on the government, simply civilians in post-nuclear conditions. Anyway, the basic story line is that the northern hemisphere was is mostly void of any live whatsoever from a complicated nuclear war and the south (focusing on Australia here) is slowly catching the radiation. The time left to live is able to be forcasted approximately. Mostly, people tend to stay in their homes and the strict rules of society break down.",
            "Nevil Shute's classic book 'On the Beach' looks at the end of the world from a different angle--a nuclear war has raged in the Northern Hemisphere, over in a month, but because of the winds the radiation is slowly covering the Southern Hemisphere, none of which were involved in the war. It's the story of the last days on Earth as experienced by the innocent Australians. It is a sad book, down to the core. And you will find tears welling in your eyes as the characters of the novel attempt to deal with their upcoming fate. It's a story of love, hope, redemption, sorrow, and peace. this is one of the greatest books I've ever read. I highly, highly recommend it to everyone.",
            "\"On the Beach\" is one of the best novels I ever read. It is also the first one, that made me crying. First of all you should not give this book to very young children. They could get in panic. I never read a novel that is so fascinating as \"on the Beach\". Although all movies about it are [bad], the book is just great. Especially the end, is extremely horrifying. However, if you like emotional books, you have to read this one.",
            "Poignant in its depiction of a selected few attempting to come to terms with the inevitable end of everything and everyone they have ever known and ever loved, On the Beach is a moving portrayal of those who have the courage to live those few, numbered days remaining to them as passionately and as fully as possible, even in the face of the end of the world. As they make plans that they know, within their souls, will never come to fruition as the world meets its doom, we become emotionally involved with Shute's characters, and we are reminded of how precious even such a mundane act as planting a garden can be. On the Beach makes you think, but it also makes you feel: this book is one of a small group of items in any medium that has ever made me cry. I can, with conviction, say On the Beach is the best book I have ever read, even being the bibliophile that I am. This book should be required reading for not only every student, but everyone. Period.",
            "The book, and the movie made from it, is one of my all time favorites. It's so compelling, that you'll probably miss the one line that explains the title. Nevil Shutes anti-war classic shows us how silly we are, running after all kinds of 'things' when, in the end, what we really survive on is each others love. The premise of the book(which I won't spoil by telling you, since he eases you into it indirectly)strips away all the clutter of life in one fell swoop, and shows with crystal clarity that beautiful and simple kindness 's we show to each other are the stuff that make the world go round. Read it, read it, read it. Then rent the video, take the phone off the hook, go to the bathroom first, turn down the lights, and roll-em'!",
            "Nevil Shute wrote &quot;On the Beach&quot; at a time when the world's two superpowers--both in the northern hemisphere--were glaring at each other pugnaciously, waving their &quot;city killer&quot; bombs, and bragging about &quot;Mutually Assured Destruction&quot; as their best insurance against nuclear war.Nevil Shute simply picked up that ball and ran with it. He assumed that the strategy had failed, and that the war had been waged, and the northern hemisphere had been destroyed by a combination of atomic blast and the nuclear clouds that emanated from those blasts.Australia, though, in the southern hemisphere--being a non-combatant--had come out unscathed in the war, and because of Coriolis force, was thus far not affected by the nuclear clouds of death. Coriolis force is that force which is created by the revolution of the earth on its axis which causes water draining in northern hemisphere sinks to circulate clockwise, while that in the southern hemisphere does so counter-clockwise. However, since there is a co-mingling of winds at the equator, the southern hemisphere was predictably doomed, and the folks who lived there knew it.The story is about the reaction of the doomed people in Australia, and their reaction to the awful knowledge of their impending deaths, and how they handled it. The protagonist, Dwight Towers, is a U.S. nuclear submarine commander who, with his crew and boat, are in Australia. There he meets Moira Davidson and they fall in love.Some of the throat-catching moments are when the American sub travels to the United States, and the silent streets on San Francisco are described. In the movie version, it was Seattle, and one of the sailors--a former resident of the Seattle area--leaves the ship to go home, a futile gesture, of course.The story describes the various emotions of those facing certain death from nuclear radiation. The death of the entire human race; inescapable, inexorable death, and how they handled it. Bitterness, of course, and recklessness (What can they do, kill me?) as well as foolhardy acts of courage (What? I might be killed?).This is a thought-provoking book. Only the shallow will describe it as &quot;out of date.&quot; One of the truly memorable reading experiences of my life. The movie is also fascinating.Joseph Pierre, USN (Ret)",
            "Nevil Shute uses no big scare tactics to try to make us wake up to the impending doom of nucuelar warfare in &quot;On the Beach&quot;. Instead he uses quiet characters doing their best to live the life they've always wanted. Most of the characters in this book do not face the reality of impending death which makes it all the more sad when it does come. A fantastic book that should continue to be read even though the cold war is over.",
            "Nevil Shute's \"On The Beach\" is a classic for good reason. Shute takes the most horrific event one can imagine--a worldwide nuclear event--and then turns the microscope on it, focusing in on just a few ordinary people who must wait for death as it drifts over to their hemisphere. We see military personnel, housewives, businessmen, and more. They come alive because they are just like you and me and the people next door.Shute's very great accomplishment here is to examine how each of the characters deals with their certain death. Everyone knows they'll die eventually; these characters have the difficulty of knowing that death will arrive soon, and that it will be slow and agonizing. What do they do? Each reacts differently and the humanity and humility with which some of the characters make their choices is startlingly powerful. Especially in a time when the world seems so uncertain, so cruel, this is an important book to read--or re-read if you picked it up years ago. Prepare yourself for a powerfully moving experience.",
            "This post-apocalyptic tale from the 1950s is an interesting exploration of the reactions of some Australians who will be among the last human beings hit by the fallout spreading south after nuclear devastation in the Northern Hemisphere.My spouse, who'd read this book when it came out, found it chilling and frightening, which I didn't particularly, perhaps because I've read so much post-apocalyptic science fiction. But also, I found an odd sort of hope in the way some of the characters dealt with living in the face of impending death. I thought there should have been more social chaos and more extreme insanity and despair as the end came near, but the reactions of this bunch of 1960s Australian middle-class white folks did seem plausible.The movie \"On the Beach,\" starring Gregory Peck and Ava Gardner, is good too and follows the book closely.",
            "To begin, I rated this book only 4 stars because it does lack a universal appeal. While I found the book to be mesmerizing, it lacks any direct action, and this tends to turn off readers who have never been weaned from their television sets. Instead, this is a book for readers with true interest in human interaction, and the intellectual maturity to let it reel them in slowly.As far as comments that the characters' reactions to nuclear holocaust are unrealistic, well that is just nonsense. Human beings have never experienced a disaster of this magnitude; to pretend to know how we would react is just a bit arrogant. Additionally (to address another complaint), while this novel does not seem like it follows a traditional plotline, it is actually quite easy to chart it on one; the one difficulty lies in the fact that the climax, as it were, is only one sentence long.What is most compelling about these pages--and a thing many readers just didn't get--is the repetition of the characters' attitudes, most keenly those of Dwight and Mary, two of the major figures. The reader is reminded, through dialogue as opposed to the equivalent of a narrative hammer, that disaster is coming and, as the book progresses, that it is coming faster. The human potential for denial is well documented historically and is demonstrated here through the various characters' reactions to the impending doom. I found myself periodically checking a map of Australia just to chart the progress of the radiation as it neared Melbourne (the last city, not a small town as one reviewer describes it) and cringing. It almost broke my heart.What finished the job was, for me, when acceptance of their fate finally comes to the characters and they spend their final days doing what they love best, or what they think is best, and finally, at the end of things, choosing to leave their world on their terms. The final conversation between Peter and Mary took many rereads for me to get over the blow. Perhaps this is because I am a young married man, and I feel keenly the years that are lost to them.",
            "One approaches a classic carefully. Rather than a novel experience, the reader brings preconceptions, prejudices, awe and maybe a whiff of resentment to a well-known book that is not entirely new to him.Mr. Shute delivers a slow-starting novel, liturgically paced with an inexorable conclusion that is with us from page one. This is the power of \"On the Beach.\" It has the inevitability of a Greek tragedy. The characters and the reader self-deceive, twist, hope, pray and promise-all to no avail.I would not call \"On the Beach\" timeless. The behaviors seem quaint and dated fifty years after the writing of the book. I doubt the characters had much believability even in 1957. Moira Davidson goes from dissolute debauchery to saintly status without even a pause for proper redemption. I can see the lovely Ava Gardner as the Jezebel, but it is quite a stretch to imagine her as St. Bernadette. Mr. Shute casts an American as a central character, but unfortunately he has not much an ear for American speech. For some reason, he believes American men, when addressing marriageable aged women leap from \"Miss Davidson\" to \"honey\" and then never call her anything else. (I don't know, maybe \"Moira\" is hard to pronounce.) Also, I fear Mr. Shute had little affinity for our youngest humans. The Holmes' baby girl Jennifer, was always referred to as \"it\" by Mr. Shute. These were small irritations, but jarring.Nevertheless, the power of the book is undeniable. There is a certain rightness that the events are larger than the humans involved. The humans respond with an orderliness that is astonishing, but perhaps Mr. Shute was trying to be kind in a very unkind world. Grade: 3-1/2 stars.",
            "Why the price increase? Was $4.95 on 1/25, now $11.99. All of the Shute books have been marked up to $11.99.That is too expensive for an old back-list item, I'll have to go to the library and forgo the convenience of my Kindle for any more of these.",
            "\"It's the end of the world as we know it and I feel fine...\"That line from the old REM song pretty much sums up Nevil Shute's \"On the Beach.\" The world has ended and everyone's pretty much OK with it.Written in the late 50's and set in the near future of the early 60's, \"On the Beach\" finds World War III has come and gone. The final battle was set off by a misunderstanding with the bigger nuclear powers shooting first and asking questions later. The result is the northern hemisphere is gone, nuked to oblivion and the southern hemisphere is waiting for the radiation to slowly spread across the entire planet and kills the survivors.It's these survivors that we meet in Australia. And they're all taking it pretty well. There's no chaos here. Everything is running fairly normally, except for the fact that we're all going to die in about six months. And not a pretty death, but a slow, painful one.The big problem with this book is the quiet acceptance every character has of this. Yes, there are some characters deep in denial and some are planning for a world beyond six months from now, but never is there any sense of panic or desparation by anyone. The most panicked we get is they move up an auto race a few months becuase the time it's scheduled to take place will be after the radiation hits.There are some moments of hope in the story that someone might be alive in the northern hemisphere or that the coming end might not come. But these are quickly dashed and then everyone accepts it with quiet resignation.I'm sure when it was written, this book was strangely scary and virtually prophetic. But reading it now, it's a story that seems dated, with characters who fail to spark much interest for the reader. I haven't read a book since \"Lucifer's Hammer\" where I actively rooted for the apocolyptic event to happen already just to kill off some of the characters in the story and maybe get things moving. And that's the biggest flaw in \"On the Beach\"--nothing happens. We don't get to see the end of the world and nothing seems to make any impact on the characters. It's a hard book to read, not because of the subject matter but because virtually nothing happens and none of the characters are interesting enough to make the investment of time worth it in the end.",
            "Having been published over fifty years ago (long before Al Gore \"took the initiative in creating the Internet\"), On the Beach is a bit dated. But the story, that of the survivors of a nuclear war, seems eerily realistic. The book begins on December 27, 1962, about a year after the end of the \"short war,\" (p 9) \"the Russian-NATO war, that had in turn been born of the Israeli-Arab war, initiated by Albania,\" and the \"use of cobalt bombs by both the Russians and the Chinese...\" during which (p 61) \"about four thousand seven hundred\" nuclear bombs were dropped. Only the inhabitants of Australia (where the story is set) and Antarctica have been spared death by radiation poisoning.Royal Australian Navy LCDR Peter Holmes is posted \"as liaison officer in U.S.S. Scorpion\" under the command of thirty-three-year-old Submarine Commander Dwight Lionel Towers, U.S.N. Towers, former resident of Mystic, Connecticut is a bit of a paradoxical character. He believes in doing things by the book, and that \"One ha[s] to live in the new world and do one's best, forgetting about the old,\" yet seems certain that he will one day be reunited with his (undoubtedly deceased) wife and two children. The Holmes family (Peter, Mary and baby Jennifer) invites Towers to their place one weekend and asks their neighbor, twenty-four year old Moira Davidson, to \"Keep him occupied...\" Of their future (the radiation is expected to arrive less than a year later), she tells him, (p 30) \"It's like waiting to be hung,\" and (p 31) \"It's not that I'm afraid of dying...It's all the things I'm going to have to miss...\" But her attitude and behavior become more positive as her feelings for Towers become stronger. Holding fast to his idea of a perfect family reunion, Towers struggles a bit in maintaining an appropriate relationship with Davidson. Rounding out the cast is a relative of Moira, civilian scientific officer, John Seymour Osborne, who is hired to go on a submarine cruise to (p 39) \"make observations and keep records of radioactive levels...\" during which the actions of one crewmember are especially memorable, the mission being undertaken in part due to (p 29) \"...radio transmission still coming from someplace near Seattle.\"Alternately resigned to, and in denial of their fate, the Holmes' create a wonderful garden, Towers readies to see his family, and Osborne, prepares for the race of his life. Especially chilling is the various characters' contemplation of the use of suicide pills. On the Beach is a powerful, unsettling look about the aftermath of a nuclear war. Also good: Voices of Chernobyl by Svetlana Alexievich.",
            "What I liked so much about this book was that it is not about saving the earth, by blowing up a comet or defeating aliens, but rather about the hopeless struggle to just hold on, and about the human reactions to this grim situation. Very stunning!",
            "I am a big fan of Nevil Shute, and have many of his books. On The Beach was not one of them...until recently! During a recent meeting with my book club, the members were discussing authors they like, and Nevil Shute ( who I had honestly not thought of in a long, long, time) was mentioned. It sent me on a hunt to find On The Beach, and as always, my first place to look for just about anything is Amazon!The book arrived in record time, has all of the nostalgic feel and look I hoped it would! It is in excellent condition, and is a wonderful addition to my collection of older, beautifully written books!",
            "Although dated ( at least temporarily, by the end of the Cold War) the book is a haunting character study of those who survive the outbreak of nuclear war, but are doomed to perish in the path of long term fallout.The author does an outstanding job of creating characters to share in the end of civilization. An American nuclear submarine Captain who has taken his submarine to Australia as the last refuge from the global spread of deadly radioactive fallout from all out nuclear war, a beautiful Australian woman who rages against her fate. The submarine skipper torn between the love of his who perished along with the rest of America and the need for someone to share the final months.Other characters enter this strong drama. It challenges the reader to find his place is this What If drama. It subtly asks the reader, what would you do if you had only months to live and all of those around you would also perish. Would you fight and suffer or would you take the pills? What challenges would you undertake if there were no long term future ? What decisions would you make for your family?In a world where the science of mass death is proliferating rapidly to both states and stateless groups these may be questions which we or our children will need to ponder.It's also one of the few great novels where the movie came close to the book and is also highly recommended.It's a magnificent gift from a golden age of novels. Shute was one of the best.",
            "GREAT BOOK. I SAW THE MOVE MANY YEARS AGO AND THEN AGAIN THIS MONTH WHICH MADE ME ORDER THE BOOK.",
            "The basic story is that Albania sends a plane with another country's markings to bomb the U.S. and we retaliate. However this is not a pacifist (don't build bombs book). This is not a sci-fi book. It could be a speculative fiction or just speculative.The story begins after the war is completed and radiation is now covering the world. Australia is the last place to be covered. You read how different people are about to meat their end, some with hope, others with reckless abandon. Still there are those like the US sub commander Dwight Towers is loyal to his country to the end by not allowing U.S. property in the end to fall into the hands of the Aussies.The book was written in the Cold War Era environment. So many people think that it is about countries and war; others think this story is some anti war story. The reality is that it is a study of people meeting a sure end and how they react. Other readers will balk at the actions of the people in this story; yet when they meet the same situation we will see how realistic the characters are. Still others will balk at the predictability of the characters. Still this is how many people get over a crisis by being predictable. It is these characteristics that make this novel timeless. Someone else must think so or they would not have made an updated version for our not too distant future.",
            "I first read this in high school 20 years ago. I liked it then but I love it now.This novel is about the end of the earth. It shows how we need to cherrish the days that we had and the long term effects of war.",
            "I read an older edition of Nevil Shute's classic story of the final months of humanity in June of 2007. I still remember the story as both a captivating read and yet a very dark tale. Apparently, a conflict in the Middle East and Balkans led to a domino effect of nuclear war. Shute's future reality (now it would be an alternative reality) has a major difference from our world: many more nations acquired nuclear weapons. Much of the Northern Hemisphere was annilihated as NATO, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China blew one another to pieces. While vast swathes of the Southern Hemisphere survived the fate of artificial dawns, a slower fate was in store as radioactivity inexorably moved south with the winds. This is the geopolitical background to the story.The human side of Shute's work is on the whole very readable. It ranges from the story of an American submarine captain who lost his family in the war to an alcoholic Australian lady who grew close to him to the tragic story of a young Australian navy officer's family to a scientist who's final dream was to win the last Grand Prix the world would ever see. This is a world where technologically powerful navies have reverted some of their few servicible ships to coal power. This is a world where the horse once again begins to replace the automobile. And it is a world coping with the reality of its own demise. A mysterious signal from North America briefly offers a faint gleaming of hope and leads to a desperate submarine mission to find the cause. However, ultimately, it would prove futile. And so the last humans were given a final respite to order their lives as time inexorably ran out. Some like some members at a prestigious club drank heavily while numerous others sought the comfort of God. Some like the scientist chose to drive for their dreams (in his case literally in particularly desperate and dangerous races). Above it all hung the simple question of how a technologically advanced civilization could destroy itself.While I don't agree with all the actions of Shute's characters and realize his specific geopolitical situation is now dated, I still found the novel a worthwhile read. It is well written, disturbing, and at times thought provoking. While not perfect, I recommend it with caution. It is not a tale which ends remotely happily.",
            "I first read this book in high school English a decade ago. I re-read it in the aftermath of 9/11 and the ensuing wars. It was a haunting read the first time around, but the Soviet threat was a dim memory for me as a child born in the 80s, and On The Beach seemed to illustrate just how lucky we were that the Iron Curtain fell and the Cold War ended. It was even more terrifying reading in the current decade, knowing the possibility of rogue nations or individuals unleashing a dirty bomb. Shute pointed out that when dealing with nuclear armaments, a small decision and mistake can have hugely terrifying consequences.However, the political discussions and implications aside, On The Beach is most touching for the humanity side of the story. What would happen to society, to the concept of right and wrong, if everyone knew that the end was in sight? Incendiary topics such as euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide become hugely important issues. All of the characters understand the terrible end waiting them if they go by radiation poisoning, yet they still struggle with whether to take the pill or not.You'll find yourself doing some self-questioning after you finish this book. What would you do if faced with the certainty that the world was ending? What are the important things in life if you don't have to worry about what future generations will think of you? Money, posessions, rivalries, grudges...I cried myself silly after the first reading. The depth of the characters is sufficiently developed by the end that you feel their deaths strongly.I took an underlying message of hope out of this book. I knew from the outset of the first reading that there was no means of survival for the characters. The characters knew there was no means of survival. But I kept hoping, and they kept making every effort to find hope and a chance for the future. We are stronger than we ever let ourselves imagine as a human race, we just need to ensure that we don't turn against ourselves as happened in On The Beach.",
            "...well, insofar as a book about the end of life on earth can be enjoyable. Until I got the book, I'd only ever seen the film, during the making of which Ava Gardner was said to have said that Melbourne was the perfect place for making a film about the end of the world, a remark which the inhabitants of great rival Sydney thoroughly enjoyed. (It's now believed that it originated from a reporter for the \"Sydney Morning Herald\").To me, Shute's laid-back, almost flat, style seems to add to the tension of the whole thing as Doomsday slowly but inevitably approaches. The thing that surprises and perplexes me is that things are all, well, so stiff upper lip and stoic. Would there not be riots in the streets? Widespread looting? Complete breakdown of all law and order? Would anyone really worry about things such as starting the fishing season early, so that people get a chance to catch a last one? Don't panic, chaps, or in Oz, No worries mate, she'll be right. I know the Aussies are pretty laid back (I'm a a naturalised one), but they're basically like everyone else. However, if you can suspend disbelief and accept that humans can behave with such dignity in the face of impending catastrophe, you may enjoy this. I did, largely because I enjoyed reading about the Melbourne I know so well.I also enjoyed the nice touches of inability to confront the unthinkable, bordering on madness - the naval wife who plans garden improvements that she will never see, the submarine captain who stays faithful to his wife and family and buys presents to take back to them, even though they are in the dead Northern Hemisphere. It raises interesting questions in one's own mind - how would I react to such a situation? When the crunch comes, few of us are heroes, even though we'd like to be. A scenario such as Shute paints is extremely unlikely but we are doing it to ourselves slowly with pollution. As the banner in the final scene in the film says, \"There is still time, brother.\"",
            "I read this novel when I was a kid, and felt that it was one of the most depressing books that I had ever read. I then recommended it to all of my friends as a must read. I still feel that way about the book, and have re-read it several times as an adult. Very powerful and well written. For those who like the book, the original movie with Gregory Peck is every bit as good, and should not be missed. Note that there was a remake a few years ago that really didn't make the cut.",
            "\"On the Beach\" was one of the first novels to describe what the aftermath of a nuclear war would be like, although the genre of post-apocalyptic novels goes back at least to Robert Cromie's \"The Crack of Doom\" in 1895. Edgar Rice Burroughs's Martians used radium bullets in 1912's \"A Princess of Mars\" and Upton Sinclair's 1924 novel \"The Millennium: A Comedy of the Year 2000\" involved atomic weapons. J.B. Priestly's \"The Doomsday Men\" in 1938 used radioactive material to disrupt the earth's crust. There was a nuclear war in the background of George Orwell's \"1984,\" and the same can be said for the Ray Bradbury collection of short stories, \"The Martian Chronicles.\"Nevil Shute's \"On the Beach\" was published in 1957, which was the same year that the Soviets launched Sputnik and Nikita Khrushchev boasted of a super bomb that could melt the polar icecaps. That might explain why this became the most prominent nuclear war novel of the decade, if not for that entire generation. Shute quotes T.S. Eliot's \"The Hollow Men\" on the title page with the famous lines \"This is the way the world ends / Not with a bang but a whimper,\" and indeed the novel is not about surviving the war but awaiting the end of the world. Given what we now know about nuclear winter, Shute's pessimism is actually somewhat understated, but that does not make it any the less disturbing.\"On the Beach\" is set in Australia, two years after the war of which all anybody knows is that it put so much radioactive fallout into the atmosphere that there are eight months left before it reaches Down Under, where humanity is making its last stand. Unlike books like \"Alas, Babylon\" by Pat Frank in 1959, which deal primarily with how people try to keep on living civilized lives in the wake of an all-out nuclear exchange, \"On the Beach\" is about facing the inevitable end. Jonestown was still a couple of decades away and the story of the mass suicides at Massada was a minor historical footnote, so when the book was published there was nothing to color the horror of a continent of human beings choosing to end their lives with pills rather than succumb to the slow death by radiation poisoning (for that matter, there was not an active cultural debate on euthanasia either). There might not be anything more unrealistic in the novel than the idea that the scientific inevitable of the coming radiation is universally accepted. Yet that is a major factor in creating the depressing nature of the novel.The focus of the novel is on a group of characters. Scientist John Osborne provides the necessary scientific details while tuning his racing car for the world's last Grand Prix. Peter and Mary Holmes are spending their final days taking care of their baby daughter and planning a garden they will never live to see. Their friend Moira Davidson chooses to sedate herself by constantly drinking, until she meets Dwight Towers, captain of the U.S.S. Scorpion, which makes him the highest ranking officer in what is left of the U.S. Navy. The two are able to provide some comfort for each other, but Towers still heeds the call to duty. When a mysterious message is received, being transmitted from Seattle where it is assumed every one is dead, Towers takes his submarine back to see if there is still reason to hope as time runs out.Part of the problem with this novel is that most readers come to it after seeing the powerful 1959 film made by director Stanley Kramer, with its haunting use of the song \"Waltzin' Matilda\" and its insistent warning that \"It's Not Too Late, Brother!\" Shute's characters are much less compelling on the page and the screenwriters were remarkably faithful to many of the key elements of the novel so you do not really get the sense of reading it to get more of the story. There are those who complain that what little Shute has to saw about the war and its weapons of mass destruction does not make sense, but as was the case with the television movie \"The Day After\" such concerns are negligible because both narratives need the war to allow them to tell their stories. Paying attention to the details definitely misses the larger picture here.Ultimately, \"On the Beach\" is more important historically than it is critically. This is not great literature, but it inspired many of the post-nuclear war novels that followed, such as Peter Bryant's \"Two Hours to Doom\" (which later became \"Dr. Strangelove\"), Helen Clarkson's \"The Last Day,\" and John Brunner's \"The Brink.\" If you have to choose between the two, watch the movie rather than read the book. But if you are a student of this genre, then you have to read this book simply because of its impact in this field. It is for that reason that I round up on this one.",
            "This book sometimes is very interesting, but we think that we can't give the rating 10, because, we in our class didn't read the original version, we only had the school edition available. During reading some bad motions grew up, and this motions became stronger as we heard of the nuclear test in India and Pakistani. The story has now become more topical in this world. This book reflects the motions from the people in such a situation. It consists of the bad reactions of a nuclear war. We can't ever understand some behaviours of the people, since we are in such a situation.Megamuff sein Sohn!",

            "On The Beach should be read by our world leaders. A frightening story because it can happen at any moment. Nuclear war seems terrible at first, but after reading this, you'll be disgusted with man's ingenuity and stupidity. He has built something that can destroy himself quite easily. Not to say that should get you down or anything. ;) Excellent book with excellent guts.",
            "This is not a book about nuclear war and its aftermath. It is about death coming as a certainty. At every turn the reader must examine his or her own feelings about the imminent fate of him- or herself. That's what really makes this book so incredibly powerful. You won't find any techno-thriller stuff here, and you won't miss it. It's about us, now, as we seek to find a meaning in life while trying to live it. This book will be around for a very long time, not because it describes so heartbreakingly the nuclear winter that is our potential future, but because it describes our life -- and our death --even without such a disaster. Read it. Savor it. It is the stuff of life.",
            "I first picked up and read this book when I was 12 I am 21 now. This book is probley the only one that stands out in my mind. The book lets us know what would prob. happen if there was a nucler fallout. The thought of it is scary but it could happen . NEvil Shute has once again out did himself. The depth alone that this holds is remarkable.",
            "From the opening paragraph to the final words, Nevil Shute presents a captivating story of survival in a world where survival is impossible. A heartbreaking tale of what things could have been, or may even be, someday in the future.",
            "The review by Dahlgren99@aol.com, of a first reading of On the Beach is remarkably descriptive of my own response in the early 1960s, reading the book at its initial popularity, and seduced by Nevil Shute's presentation of human extinction into believing it probable, perhaps inevitable, in just the way he described it. Be careful with this author's power over your emotional responses, for he looks into individual souls of his characters (who include his readers) and gives them a post-hypnotic suggestion that what he said is true. Test it out. Read Trustee from the Toolroom. You will never be the same",
            "Nevil Shute gives us the unique opportunity to be a fly on the wall of a community that has the distinction of being the last community left on earth. How or why that community comes to this distinction is nowhere near as important as how it deals with that distinction. On the Beach is a tour de force of emotions and feelings felt by realistic characters as the last six months of human life on earth is played out in a large Australian city; that because of its southern location has managed to survive a worldwide nuclear holocaust. Now it must face what the rest of the world has already experienced. The inescapable radiation that is drifting down from the already dead northern hemisphere. The story, although science fiction, is of the individuals that must come to grips with who they were, who they are now, and what they will do, now that the end is almost inevitable.Mr. Shute is very good at weaving a story even though it was more plausable when it was written over thirty years ago. But his real genius lies in the timeless account of the many individuals we are introduced to, and are slowly dying with. There is no real pain, only that which we each create as we live and eventually face death. This community is a mirror we see ourselves in, and the view may be eye opening indeed, for we are not out from under the nuclear dragon yet. A timeless tale.",
            "This tidbit of cold-war horror will give you a chill that will not go away. There may not be another book that brought the realities of nuclear annihilation home like this one. The added horror it brings is in an awareness of what \"collateral damage\" now means to the world. We would not be ending ourselves but taking everybody with us. The idea of limited nuclear war is ludicrous for readers of this monumental book that defined a generation.",
            "The premise and tone of the book are unassailable. The possibility and plausibility of a humanity-ending nuclear war, especially in the late 1950s (but still lingering today, I hope none of us forget), is a theme that should and will never grow old, and the stoic \"not with a bang, but with a whimper\" approach of this book is extremely powerful. Unfortunately, the author's one-dimensional view of humanity turns what could have been (and I am not exaggerating) the greatest book of the twentieth century into a painful, head-shaking experience.In order for the stoic attitudes of the characters to feel true, we must be given something to contrast it with. It's inconceivable that everyone would react in almost exactly the same way. There are only a handful minor breaks in the ubiquitous stiff upper lip; twice from stereotypically hysterical 1950s women who break down only to 'come to their senses' a page or two later, and a few people who take suicidal risks like gentlemen (this isn't so much a rejection of stoicism as different variant, though.) These exceptions are welcome, but what's really missing from the story isn't the despair; it's the optimism. The story takes place in Melbourne (which is at the southern edge of Australia) with the radiation clouds slowly coming from the north. Town after town falls deathly silent as the cloud overtakes them, but the author actually mentions at one point that very few people bother fleeing to the south (and I don't believe we meet any of them. Maybe some were in the race, I forget), even though they have enough time to make it on horse or foot, even though it becomes clear towards the end of the book that people have been hoarding enough gasoline to make such a last-ditch effort feasible. It might have been a challenge to portray this panicked flight for survival while maintaining the stoic tone, but without it the reader is left struggling with a vast emotional gulf between plausible reality and fatalistic caricature. It doesn't matter if you, personally, would choose the stoic route and die in your home instead of fleeing for another month or two of life; a sizable fraction of the population undoubtedly would. Another sizable fraction of the population would've killed themselves far earlier. But to pretend that the instinct for survival is so universally anemic is just... bad storytelling. I don't even mind that all of the main characters were stoics, but when the entire continent calmly accepts their fate instead of walking south it breaks all suspension of disbelief.The problem gets worse when the reader begins to analyze the situation from a scientific perspective. They had over a year to prepare and no one, NO ONE IN THE ENTIRE FRIGGIN' COUNTRY attempted to construct any sort of shelter to survive the fallout. The author shoots himself in the foot by reminding us, again and again, that the earth will be uninhabitable for only 20 years (this is a roughly accurate estimate of the aftereffects of well-aerosolized \"salted\" cobalt bombs.) I'm not arguing that the tone of the book should've been changed; far from it. The author could have invented a fictional deadly isotope with a halflife of hundreds or thousands of years. He could have claimed the bombs' aerosolization techniques were too advanced for the best air filters in the world to cope with. He could have mentioned oxygen generating plants being destroyed, or a famine preventing the stockpiling of nonperishable foods. He could have mentioned a effort to construct a shelter that later fails for some unforeseen reason. But he did not. The best he offers is a single scientist, never encountered by the main characters personally, who believes that heavy rain patterns might cause the fallout to settle earlier than expected. This is the culmination of an entire year of brainstorming! In the history of humanity, what culture would have the fatalism to come up with nothing better than \"we shouldn't bother to actually try anything, but it might go away on its own\"?Maybe my suspension of disbelief is what's anemic. I might have managed it, but for the author deciding to prominently feature a nuclear submarine throughout the plot. Apparently, the submarine offers near total immunity to the radiation while it is submerged, and it has the ability to safely check surface radiation levels via its periscope. It also has the capability to generate its own oxygen from seawater, through electrolysis. And again, they have something like a year to modify it, collect extra nuclear fuel for it, create undersea caches of food and fuel and oxygen and supplies safe from the radiation... but does anyone try? Does anyone ever mention that it might be worthwhile trying to save a few members of the human race from a death cloud they know for certain will only remain deadly for 20 years? The final depressing scene in this depressing story was beautifully done, I won't spoil it, except to say that for me it was spoiled by the unavoidable knowledge that one of the main characters is sitting in the instrument of his own salvation, if only a single person from the entire continent would point it out...My other complaint is that, while his tone and scene construction are perfect, the author does not always have the most beautiful prose. And when much of the book is spent describing everyday life, this can turn into a serious problem. As others have noted, he uses the word \"presently\" gratuitously, and in a few scenes he utterly fails to instill a sense of wonder or immersion. At one point we're meant to watch people go on one last fishing trip... I had to skip over this part almost entirely. Hemingway he is not, and when 'somewhat prosaic prose' meets 'infuriatingly fatalistic characters' the result is just unbearable.Why three stars then? Because it's extremely important as a historical work, because the science is fairly solid (except for the omissions), because we don't have enough post-apocalyptic stories that fully realize the terrifying truth that humanity could easily not make it through the \"post-\", because the tone was hauntingly perfect and *almost* (if we imagine our own optimism-killing sideplots) realistic, and because the allegory that *we are all doomed to death* so we might as well live our lives the best we can is surprisingly and powerfully sobering.But in crafting us this magnificent \"whimper\", he sacrificed far too much of basic human nature. In the end, I could not suspend disbelief enough to ignore fatalistic stupidity run rampant over an entire continent. Perhaps you can.",

            "I have never been taken to a lower state of emotion by a book. Shute does a great job of character creation. I empathized with every one. I can understand how people in such a situation would create fantasies to deal with their inevitable demise. I would like to recommend this book to the leaders of the world who have a nuclear program. Maybe they will feel the pain of the characters in this book and change course. Probably not. This book has been available for forty years, and it hasn't worked yet.",
            "We gave the book an 8,and this consists of the lower note for the first part of the book(for us it was only a 6),and for the end of the story,which was really exciting and for us a 9. Some parts at the beginning were really boring,for example when Peter Holmes talked about his cart with the man,who sold the milk.It had nothing to do with the storyline.But on the other hand we were really shocked by the way,in which the people and the characters of the book had to die or to kill themselves.At the end you feel with the characters ,and you think about that,what you would do in such a sitation. We are a class of german pupils who have read the book in a simplified edition. So sometimes it was a little bit boring,because of the easy language. If we had read it in German,it would have been a better grade for the book. END",
            "This is a fascinating book, and Shute is particularly successful in building tension as the inevitable comes closer and closer -- i.e., the death of mankind. One proviso: I have far less faith in human nature than Shute does. Is it likely that people, knowing that their death is inevitable and near, will behave with the good sense and civility Shute depicts? I can't help but think that many would give way to complete excess, degeneracy and violence. It's ironic that Shute thinks man is capable of launching a nuclear holocaust, but will then behave with the utmost decorum when rules no longer apply and when all bets are off.",
            "I mostly picked up this book because I thought it was science-fiction. I had heard of the movie, but it was a little before my time and besides, I heard it wasn't that good anyway. So, I picked up this book, opened it to read and found myself captured by something more realistic than anything than science-fiction could ever create.I, for one, am far too young to remember the days of the Cold War, when the threat of nuclear disaster hung over our parents' heads like a grim spectre. But upon reading this book, I found a sick feeling beginning to form in my gut, an old fear, perhaps a memory of those gone before. I got the sense that this still could happen, and I read faster, with growing intensity.On the Beach grabs you and never lets go, even beyond the end. The characters, all detailed, could be someone living next door to you, and the way they go through their motions, even as they know the rain is heading nearer and nearer is frightening and all too human. The tone of the novel, the narration, is calm, resigned, as if the narrator has come to grips with his fate, even if the characters haven't yet.There is no hope in this book. As a science-fiction reader, I am accostumed to last second saves and plot twists from nowhere, but even as I got closer and closer to the end I realized with foul certainity that there was no surviving. But the people, they don't struggle, they merely make plans for things that will never be done, not looking for a way out, because there is none.Nevil Shute is not a literary writer like Pynchon or Joyce or Gaddis, and his prose is not lyrical, but it is always calm, uncluttered, the exact meaning never failing to reach you. This was easily the most powerful novel I have ever read and when I closed it, I shut it with a shudder, emerging finally from the dark world of a nuclear winter.Still as true today as forty years ago, everyone should read this book and perhaps learn something from it. Before it's too late",
            "On the Beach is one of those rare books that evade categories. Science Fiction because of its backdrop (nuclear war), it should be placed in a category with literature that defines what it is to be human. The story, as I saw it, was not about humanity facing extinction (atomic or otherwise), but about how each character faced personal extinction with others in the same situation. Duty, hope, fear, anger, mortality, acceptance, all present; all dealt with. Death could have come to the characters in any fashion, from AIDS to old age and the feelings would be the same. What is amazing to me is that Nevil Schute managed to craft a book to deal with these feelings/reactions in such a short amount of actual print. My suggestion is not to read this book as science fiction. Read it as you would read To Kill a Mockingbird, A Canticle for Leibowitz, Lord of the Flies, or A Tale of Two Cities",
            "Forty years after its publication, &quot;On the Beach&quot; remainsthe most compelling book ever written on nuclear war andhumankind. Not a &quot;technothriller&quot;, it offers only a starkcontrast between human indencency and decency in the quietchronicle of the end of our existence, as the radioactiveaftermath of nuclear war spreads inexorably from the warringcountries to the remainder of the globe, reaching the lastsurvivors of humanity in southern Australia. The struggleto face dispair without embracing it gives this book a powerand depth seldom found in modern fiction. For anyone whohas lived through the &quot;cold war&quot;, and for anyone who hasnot, &quot;On the Beach&quot; is a book you must read. Its relevanceis perhaps greater today than when written, for the spectreof nuclear madness, although more plausible than ever beforein the face of almost uncontrolled proliferation, is lessbelieved than at any time past. Nevil Shute's masterworkwill disturb your complacency.",
            "It was an interesting story about a fictional war. It made me cry. I liked it though",
            "In an interesting choice, Shute portrays an end of the world nuclear war novel with no violence at all. Rather we see the aftermath of a civilized country intact and waiting for inevitable radiation death. This makes it all the more chilling.We see a variety of viewpoints through the characters, some who accept their fate yet continue going on their day to day duties as if the world would go on, mostly to fill their days with something to do and maintain their sanity. Some who hold out hope that the radiation will not reach them or they will not get sick. Some who are in outright denial, and some who are partying their life away.The centerpoint characters are a young Australian couple, and an American submarine commander and a Australian \"party girl\" who is quite affected by the demeanor of the commander. Their unconsummated romance is truly heartbreaking as the commander remains faithful to his wife though she is of course dead.The Australian couple are also touching as the wife is more or less in denial and the husband accepting of the reality, though playing along to support her emotional needs.In no way an exciting book, but compelling and affecting. The T.S. Eliot at the beginning is the perfect summation of the ending.",
            "The question of what one would do if the world were coming to an end is the premise of Nevil Shute's 1957 novel \"On the Beach.\" Despite being half a century old, the novel is powerful and timeless in its portrayal of the narrow tightrope we have walked ever since the first nuclear explosion lit up the skies over New Mexico on that morning in July 1945.Two years have passed since an all-out nuclear war destroyed Earth's northern hemisphere, and people remain alive only in the southern hemisphere, particularly in Australia, where the story takes place. But not for long, as global weather patterns are slowly but steadily blowing the lethal fallout southwards and radiation counts are inching higher. As the unavoidable doom grows closer, people react in various ways. One family, the wife in deep denial, goes about planting next year's flowerbeds and charting their infant daughter's future. A young woman finds solace in endless bottles of alcohol. A respected scientist realizes his dream of becoming a racecar driver. An American naval officer whose family was killed during the war takes refuge in military discipline and protocol. And the government quietly manufactures instant-death suicide pills for when the coming radiation sickness becomes too painful to further withstand.When the novel was originally published, the hydrogen bomb was a recent invention and we were told how recovery from an atomic war merely involved putting brick back on top of brick. When I first read it in the early 1980s, the Americans and the Soviets routinely threatened each other with obliteration and films like \"The Day After\" and \"Threads\" seared our collective consciousness with images of what life could be like after a nuclear war. Today, nations are invaded for allegedly preparing to build nuclear weapons by other nations who then turn around and plan a new generation of nuclear weapons for their own use.But in Shute's vision, there is no rebuilding, no \"after.\" There is only the impending human extinction. Plausible? Possibly. Bleak? Certainly. But the book takes such an inexorable approach to its subject that the inevitable moment of The End leaves one shattered and drained.\"On the Beach\" is a powerful read, one that should be required for anyone who believes that a nuclear war can be fought and won, that any nation's security depends on the ability to not just defeat but utterly annihilate a real or potential adversary, that our freedom somehow depends on our remaining underneath a sword of Damocles composed of ever more numerous and terrifying weapons.",
            "If you would like to read a petrifying and breath-taking novel about the world coming to an end after a nuclear war, then read On The Beach by Nevil Shute. In this novel, Nevil Shute clearly expressed how the lives of many people would be, as they knew their time on earth would be short and their plans and dreams would never be carried out. Still they prayed and hoped of a miracle that would never come.On The Beach has no particular level of suspense, no real thrills, and only one foreseeable way to close. The book tells a simple story about a nuclear war that has devastated the Northern Hemisphere. The characters in the story capture our attention on the reality of death. As the toxic rain moves closer and closer to the characters the world slowly comes toward an inevitable end.Shute did an excellent job on this book even though the beginning was kind of slow. The further into the book you get, the deeper and more involved you will be. This book is very emotional and it really makes you think about the things you do in your everyday life and whether or not you are living life to the fullest.",
            "On The Beach, as others have said, suffers a bit as a product of its era, not so much for the cold war stuff (which I still find chilling) but for the stilted and polite portrayal of its characters, as starched and straightforward as 50's Hollywood. It also seemed not quite believable that an entire community of people would face demise with the same orderly sense of denial and detachment; I am positive that there would be more chaos than dignity under such circumstances. None of this detracts from the building hopelessness toward the inevitable conclusion, which does benefit from the straightforward writing style. It arrives all too soon just as it would, and I found that part of the book at least to be terribly real and sad, and it stayed in my mind long after I finished. A favorite apocalyptic novel that this made me want to read again (and that I don't see mentioned in some of the top lists here) is This Is The Way The World Ends by James Morrow. This book made me cry.",
            "Aside from the questions raised by other reviewers as to scientific credibility, the real question to me is: would people awaiting doom continue to act as thoroughly civilized as did the characters in this story? Seems doubtful to me; nevertheless, On the Beach was a fascinating story, moody and thought-provoking.",
            "Nevil Shute is brilliant in his answer to his own question - If you knew when and how you were definitely going to die, would you try to go out with a bang, or just wait for the end? Some of his characters go one way, others attempt to leave their mark on the world. This chillingly horrific and completely plausible story begs the question what would you do. Written in the late 50's, but taking place at any time since then (Moira's Ford LTD was still around in the 80's), Shute's vision of the outcome of a nuclear holocaust, and the war from whence it happened, are frightenly possible. I recommend that everyone read this book. I suggest that it be put into school curricula. This neo-classic is as important a story of modern times as Shakespeare is of yore. I still find chills running up my back when I peruse the pages of On the Beach.",
            "I first read this book several years ago and it is one that I have returned to recently. The plot, that the world is going to end and there is nothing and nobody that can stop it, is deeply and profoundly disturbing. One almost wants to stop it, to hope that somehow, in the next paragraph or chapter that some escape route is going to be revealed. The slow and steady progress of the unstoppable radioactive cloud provides a backdrop of very real terror against the apparant normality of everyday existence. What makes this book all the more disturbing is the lack of blind panic, the lack of people losing their heads and the gradual acceptance of what is going to happen. I have read other books on this topic but none that has ever touched me in the way that this one did. It is a book I certainly will never forget.",
            "I was looking for another book by Nevil Shute when I came across &quot;On the Beach&quot; and I'm glad I did. As another reader commented, when you put the book down, it feels as if you were facing the end of the world too. The atmosphere of the book is that powerful. The gradualness of the inevitable end is eerie. I was chilled as city after city in the Southern Hemisphere faded out of life. The submarine trip to the Northern Hemisphere was equally chilling. I definitely would encourage interested people to read it.",
            "There is no question in my mind why On the Beach is considered a classic in the sci fi genre and the sub-genre, apocalyptic fiction. This book had an interesting spin on it because of the way the world ends. The northern hemisphere has destroyed itself in nuclear war. The radiation slowly drifts down to the southern hemisphere. This book takes place in southern australia, one of the last places to get the radiation. It's not so much about the end of the world, but how you deal with the knowledge that you are going to die, and you know roughly when and how. Excellent book, even if you aren't a fan of sci fi or end of the world/nuclear holocaust stories, this one should be picked up because it is more a story of human nature than science fiction.",
            "I was sixteen when I read &quot;On the Beach.&quot; It was required reading, and when I finished, I was sitting in my civic's class, but for a moment I wasn't sure where I was. The story was so captivating, I thought I was experiencing the end of the world myself. Thirty three years later and I still remember this novel as one of the best stories I have ever read. It makes you appreciate life and love and how it can all end suddenly.",
            "This book, and \"alas Babylon,\" by Pat Frank, are the two books I know of that describe a word devastated by nuclear war. Pat Frank was an American, and, thus, wrote of a Florida village, where Shute, a cosmopolite, wrote of Australia. Two full reads, none in the last 15 years, and still, from time to time, I find myself thinking back on Jonathan Osborn, the car racer, the Holmes family, Dwight and Moira, etc. you will, too, if you give this a chance. depressing, yes, but it's what could have happened to us all 40 to 50 years ago, and god be thanked it didn't.",
            "Stories that deal with the the end of the world often suggest that end through the style of the author. Those who have read ON THE BEACH often complain of the deadening weight of a style that is long on sensory description but short on memorable character interaction. Yet, that is precisely the point that author Nevil Shute wants to make of his apocalyptic view of worldwide nuclear death. By the time the book begins, the plot mechanism has already been set. A nuclear war has broken out, with most of the world's major centers of population put to the torch. The reader does not see this; in fact he hears about it only second hand. The stark impression that Shute draws comes mostly from dialogue with surviving Australians, who have as yet been untouched by the clouds of killing radiation that have swept the rest of the world. Unlike other post-war dramas, this one shows the aftermath, survivors who decide when and how to react in their respective ways. The primary focus is on American submarine commander Dwight Towers, who has successfully landed his sub in an Australian port. He strikes up a relation with a local woman, Moira Davidson, and they are well aware that the nuclear clock is ticking on their lives. The immunity that Australia has had is but temporary. The radiation that has spread worldwide is now slowly infiltrating their air. The dramatic center of the book is not so much human-based, but idea-based. Dwight and Moira, and other couples in the book, carry on as best they can, but the only real choice left to all of them is when to end their lives via suicide pills before the poison cloud does that for them. It is noteworthy what they do before they take the death pills. Most simply do what they have always done, the normal mundane things that marked so much of their pre-war lives. A few do dangerous things like driving in races that produce fatalities for most of the drivers. The unspoken point that Shute makes and many readers miss is the connection between what he says and how he says it. The end of the world and all life is truly a desensitizing concept. Shute's style of excessive detail and lack of human interaction suggest the feelings of the major characters. Dwight, Moira. and the others are both physically and psychologically disconnected from one another. By the end of the novel, they are dead or dying. The gap between a still surviving Dwight and Moira is emphasized by his decision to spend his last day on earth sinking his sub with all hands aboard rather than spend that last day together. ON THE BEACH is truly a depressing novel that shows the physical interactions between the dead and dying as less important than their psychic distancing. Sometimes, the expression of fear and gloom are better understood by focusing on how the characters feel rather than on what they do. No one ever said that a writing style must be perky.",
            "I am an avid fan of end of the world ANYTHING (ranging from the religious to the ridiculous), and this is one EVERYONE's top apocalyptic lists, but I just didn't feel riveted like many others. THis book was small, but it still felt slow in its story. And depressing? You better believe it! But the point of the story is its realism; nuclear holocaust is supposed to depress the hell out of you! I could've passed on the trashy alchoholic character, but for its time frame (Australia in the post apocalyptic 1950's) and its size (less than 200 pages in my paperback), it is worth an afternoon to read.",
            "On the Beach was written to give the effect of the world ending. It did this very well but it was also quite dull. The book opens your eyes to some things we all never really thought imaginable and it makes you think. I feel Nevil Shute could have accomplished this better with some action and grabbing the reader.",
            "For all sad words of tongue and pen, The saddest are these, 'It might have been'. - John Greenleaf Whittier I wept openly at the ideas of loss this book showed me. It reminded me of the dark nights of childhood when I thought that &quot;the day&quot; would inevitably come.",
            "On The Beach, was a decent book. It was very easy to follow, and the character's were just your everyday people, which helps bring the reality of the story closer to home. The story is about people living in Australia, basically waiting to die. A nuclear war had taken place in the Northern Hemisphere, and now they were waiting for the nuclear cloud from the war that was headed there way, everyone else in the world was gone. They are going to die from the radiation that is carried in the cloud, but because of the air movement, they still have a few months to live. It basically describes these peoples lives and what they do with the little time they have left. On The Beach can be slow, but it is a good book that describes the what could come of a nuclear war.",
            "While looking for new books on this website, I came upon the reviews of &quot;On the Beach,&quot; which I first read 25 years ago. It amazed me to find several negative reviews as I found it one of the most compelling and memorable novels I've ever read. In the late 70s, I casually picked up the book while visiting my aunt. With no review or introduction in mind, I started reading. The book begins in such a normal fashion with no hint of the coming apocalypse. When I realized what was happening, I was stunned -- almost sick to my stomach. I'm still amazed that Neville Shute also wrote &quot;A Town Like Alice,&quot; which is equally compelling, yet totally different.",
            "i had read this book around 4-5 yrs. back.and recently got a chance to read it again..its absolutely fantastic the way author had gone deep in the psyches of different people dealing with the coming catastrophe.....it actually makes one realise the horrifying results of a nuclear war if it takes place. i think that all the world leaders should be reading this book ...esp. the leaders of the nuclear countries...i suggest anyone who is in for a good reading should necessarily be reading this book. place.",
            "The writing was somewhat dull, the bias against women was annoying (two women characters: one was a drunken slut, the other comparable to Rose of Sharon of the Grapes of Wrath, without coming into her own). So why did I enjoy this book? It's just one of those things. Such a classic portrayal of human nature stripped to the core is easily forgivable for any petty flaws. On The Beach was essential for its time. We all cringe to think about what the world would be like if we all knew when we would die, and how. Nevil Shute makes this a reality, bringing to life the unsettling details we've all thought about time and again. Maybe the writing is a little mundane, maybe the ideas are old-fashioned. Look past it. On the Beach is a worthwhile read.",
            "I like this book Xena rule",
            "This book was a amazing read. This was book recommended to me by a PoliSci professor at the University of Alabama and I am so glad I read it. On The Beach presents a very gloomy and sad side to nuclear war. I felt so sorry for everyone in the world that had to survive the war and know that they were going to die either by radiation poisoning or by taking another way out. I think this book serves a good purpose and shows a great fictional lesson learned, about what happens when a war of that magnitude breaks out and the suffering that goes along with it. It never seemed like it occured to anyone that they were going to die until the moment came and everyone they loved dies around them. If only the world leaders with nuclear power could read this and see that nuclear war isn't the answer and should be avoided at all costs.",
            "After a nuclear war, The world is dying. People are waiting near the beach in australia, for their own inevitable death. Such a story can be viewed in two aspects. One is the global aspect. Demonstrating the horrors of a nuclear war and its consequences. In that sense the story is quite effective and thought provoking, depicting the death of our planet in a realistic understated manner. The other is the personal aspect. How do the people deal with their own inevitable death? In this sense the story is really weak. The people react to their death in a mostly one-dimentional way, on the range of denial/indifference/acceptance. The author sketches the way people react to the situation right in the begining of the book, and doesn't tell us anything new in this aspect throughout the book. And this is the biggest problem of the book. Another problem I had was with the subplots. Some of them were quite boring. However, overall, this is a good book, and worth reading.",
            "I think most people here have already summed up this book, and there is little I can add to what they've said. I'll try anyway.On the Beach tells the story of the aftermath of an all-out nuclear war. The setting is Australia, one of the few places in the world to escape not only the bombs, put the deadly clouds of radioactive fallout from the war. But they'll only survive for a little while, because the global wind currents are slowly pushing the deadly fallout down to Antarctica. The Aussies only have a short time before they all come down with radiation sickness and die. The whole book is an emotional rollercoaster as the dreaded day of death looms ever closer, with absolutely nothing to prevent doom. Most people are resigned to their fate, and try and stay busy with various daily rituals in an effort to keep their sanity.The two main characters of the book are Dwight Towers, a U.S. submarine commander who has survived the war and is in refuge in Australia, and Moira Davidson, a young Australian girl who is bitter about her fate and seeks consolation with Dwight. Other characters are introduced, such as a young couple with a baby and a scientist who likes racing cars. The reader is quickly drawn into these people's lives, and really comes to care about what happens to them. Needless to say, the ending isn't warm and cheery. I had to stop reading the book several times and take a little break to get rid of the huge lump in my throat. It is a VERY tough read at the end. If you don't get emotional, you just might be dead.There are several small points to make about the book. The author, Nevil Shute, isn't exactly the best writer in terms of grammar. There are awkward sentences and errors, and it sometimes detracts from the story. He also wrote this book in the late 1950's, and he's English, so there are words that don't make much sense today. Despite these flaws, the story is still gut wrenching and compelling. I really appreciated Shute's sense of irony. Moira first meets Dwight because she is enlisted to keep his mind off of his dead family in America. However, Moira ends up being the one who starts to break down. More irony appears when people make plans that they know they won't be alive to keep. The scene when Peter and Mary are planning their garden is is a good example of this irony, and you'll groan in anguish over it. Overall, I haven't been this upset over something since I watched the film &quot;Cutting Moments&quot;.I'm surprised more people haven't heard of this book. I gave it to my Mom to read first, and she bawled like a baby at the end. You may not bawl, but you'll certainly be affected.",
            "&quot;On the Beach&quot; is one of those books that you read for the concept and the story, but not for the quality of the writing. The plot centers around the lives of a few remaining survivors of a nuclear war who live in Australia. Since the was has taken place in the northern hemisphere, Australia has largely escaped unscathed--for the moment. But as prevailing winds approach Australia, they carry lethal doses of radiation with them. The implication of this is that all of the characters in the book--in fact everyone in the world--will inevitably be extinguished.&quot;On the Beach&quot; has a profound psychological impact because it is devoid of the intense action that usually accompanies nuclear apocolypse films. The destruction has already occurred elsewhere and the citizens of Australia are largely going about their business knowing they will soon die. The fact that their infrastructure has not been destroyed and that all of their social aparatus is still intact makes their fate all the more sad and earie.Although this book is set in the Cold War it's outcome is still relevant and feasible today. The nuclear warheads generated by the arms race haven't gone away. The former Soviet Union is a desparate, chaotic place, and as several reviewers pointed out, more small countries are joining the nuclear club. One could say that Nuclear madness has merely transformed itself, but its danger certainly hasn't disappeared.I think everyone should read this book to be reminded of the possible future we all face.",
            "After a nuclear war, radiation slowly drifts southwards, gradually killing off humanity there as it has already been killed off in the Northern Hemisphere. The end is less than a year away, yet Australians, and a few American naval refugees seek to maintain their daily lives in the face of doom, and even send an exploratory submarine northwards.The fascination of the book is watching how people react to the inevitable doom. Many just go on plegmatically, a few pretend it will never happen. Most interesting is Moira Dawson, an Australian girl who had dreamed of visiting London and Paris, and now never will, and who seeks to live what little life is left to the fullest. She learns a lesson from a stillborn romance with Dwight Towers, the submarine commander who acts as if his wife and children are alive in Connecticut.Perhaps the limitation of this book is that most of the characters simply accept their doom, presumably having come to terms with it before the start of the book. But more of a range of viewpoints might be welcome. Could you imagine the anger and frustration of teenagers under these circumstances, in the throes of adolescence without the promise of adulthood, knowing they will never have their independence.As in most of Shute's later works, there are no villians. That is welcome when so many books have paper villains for us to vicariously hate.",
            "As radiation from a nuclear war that destroyed all life in the northern half of the earth gradually spreads southward to deliver its poison to all who live there, a number of Australians and a handful of Americans who reside among them attempt to continue some facet of normal life, even when the time for all things is nearly done. We learn going into this foreboding novel that at most one year remains to even the most fortunate of those yet alive. We read along as the last of humankind pathetically (or is it with dignity?) plant gardens, play with their children, reform from their alcoholism, fall in love, race cars...the list could go on and on. What must it be like to dwell under these horrible circumstances? What must it do, for instance, to the mind of a devout theist when she sees the deity to whom she has maintained lifelong faith is not going to arrive deus ex machina to save her and make everything right again? What must utter and complete moral hopelessness be like? How horrible must it be to be young and rise each morning knowing the despair that would come with so many hopes lying before you, now impossible to ever fulfill? And what must it be like to be a parent and understand that the children you bought into a terrible world reeling in extremis, will die in a matter of weeks?On The Beach is not about exploding cities and geo-political confrontations. The war and the nations who fought it are distant, quiet memories, barely of significance. On The Beach is about people, and how those people carry on in the face of a doom they neither created nor can elude. It is one of the darkest works of fiction ever produced, and also one of the finest. If it impacts a jaded modern reader so startlingly, what must it have been like to read this fifty years ago when the very concept of global extinction after nuclear conflict, was new?A universal, eternal classic of the Cold War era.",
            "This novel gives a very possible, and frighteningly probable, view of the way things could easily end up, as small and unstable countries enter the growing club of nuclear armament. The most eery (yet unfortunately difficult to swallow) aspect of the book is the refusal by many of the supposedly intelligent characters to truly absorb the reality of the situation. Bit by bit, over the space of a couple of years, radiation is slowly drifting across the equator from the heavily bombed, destroyed, and radioactive northern continents, to invade and kill the southern half of the globe in turn. But people continue to plan for the future, and act as though that future will come.Unfortunately, the characters are so 2-dimensional, and act such trite and ordinary roles, that they failed to come alive for me. I never could quite believe in their reactions, either. That they could so fully split their consciousness of the approaching radiation from the actions of their daily life boggled my mind, and blew my suspension of disbelief.Sorry. Great concept, unconvincingly executed.",
            "\"On the Beach\" was one of the first novels to describe what the aftermath of a nuclear war would be like, although the genre of post-apocalyptic novels goes back at least to Robert Cromie's \"The Crack of Doom\" in 1895. Edgar Rice Burroughs's Martians used radium bullets in 1912's \"A Princess of Mars\" and Upton Sinclair's 1924 novel \"The Millennium: A Comedy of the Year 2000\" involved atomic weapons. J.B. Priestly's \"The Doomsday Men\" in 1938 used radioactive material to disrupt the earth's crust. There was a nuclear war in the background of George Orwell's \"1984,\" and the same can be said for the Ray Bradbury collection of short stories, \"The Martian Chronicles.\"Nevil Shute's \"On the Beach\" was published in 1957, which was the same year that the Soviets launched Sputnik and Nikita Khrushchev boasted of a super bomb that could melt the polar icecaps. That might explain why this became the most prominent nuclear war novel of the decade, if not for that entire generation. Shute quotes T.S. Eliot's \"The Hollow Men\" on the title page with the famous lines \"This is the way the world ends / Not with a bang but a whimper,\" and indeed the novel is not about surviving the war but awaiting the end of the world. Given what we now know about nuclear winter, Shute's pessimism is actually somewhat understated, but that does not make it any the less disturbing.\"On the Beach\" is set in Australia, two years after the war of which all anybody knows is that it put so much radioactive fallout into the atmosphere that there are eight months left before it reaches Down Under, where humanity is making its last stand. Unlike books like \"Alas, Babylon\" by Pat Frank in 1959, which deal primarily with how people try to keep on living civilized lives in the wake of an all-out nuclear exchange, \"On the Beach\" is about facing the inevitable end. Jonestown was still a couple of decades away and the story of the mass suicides at Massada was a minor historical footnote, so when the book was published there was nothing to color the horror of a continent of human beings choosing to end their lives with pills rather than succumb to the slow death by radiation poisoning (for that matter, there was not an active cultural debate on euthanasia either). There might not be anything more unrealistic in the novel than the idea that the scientific inevitable of the coming radiation is universally accepted. Yet that is a major factor in creating the depressing nature of the novel.The focus of the novel is on a group of characters. Scientist John Osborne provides the necessary scientific details while tuning his racing car for the world's last Grand Prix. Peter and Mary Holmes are spending their final days taking care of their baby daughter and planning a garden they will never live to see. Their friend Moira Davidson chooses to sedate herself by constantly drinking, until she meets Dwight Towers, captain of the U.S.S. Scorpion, which makes him the highest ranking officer in what is left of the U.S. Navy. The two are able to provide some comfort for each other, but Towers still heeds the call to duty. When a mysterious message is received, being transmitted from Seattle where it is assumed every one is dead, Towers takes his submarine back to see if there is still reason to hope as time runs out.Part of the problem with this novel is that most readers come to it after seeing the powerful 1959 film made by director Stanley Kramer, with its haunting use of the song \"Waltzin' Matilda\" and its insistent warning that \"It's Not Too Late, Brother!\" Shute's characters are much less compelling on the page and the screenwriters were remarkably faithful to many of the key elements of the novel so you do not really get the sense of reading it to get more of the story. There are those who complain that what little Shute has to saw about the war and its weapons of mass destruction does not make sense, but as was the case with the television movie \"The Day After\" such concerns are negligible because both narratives need the war to allow them to tell their stories. Paying attention to the details definitely misses the larger picture here.Ultimately, \"On the Beach\" is more important historically than it is critically. This is not great literature, but it inspired many of the post-nuclear war novels that followed, such as Peter Bryant's \"Two Hours to Doom\" (which later became \"Dr. Strangelove\"), Helen Clarkson's \"The Last Day,\" and John Brunner's \"The Brink.\" If you have to choose between the two, watch the movie rather than read the book. But if you are a student of this genre, then you have to read this book simply because of its impact in this field. It is for that reason that I round up on this one.",
            "&quot;On the Beach&quot; was published in 1957 at the height of the Cold War. Set in the near future (the early 1960's), people in Australia are waiting with dignity for radioactive fallout to kill them. A nuclear war in the northern hemisphere has already destroyed everything there. In a few months the same will happen here.I read &quot;On the Beach&quot; in 1989. That same year I had seen &quot;The Day After&quot; and &quot;Testament&quot;. For some reason I had a morbid fascination with the end of the world, and what might happen after.&quot;On the Beach&quot; might seem a bit dated now. The consequences of nuclear war have been speculated upon for several years. In 1983 scientists came up with the nuclear winter theory, where all the dust and fallout from the explosions would block out the sun and cause the world to freeze over. It sounds plausible enough. Once the winter was over the ozone layer would be damaged and the planet saturated with ultaviolet light from the sun. Others argue that people would survive somewhere, not everyone would die from radiation.Whatever the case, &quot;On the Beach&quot; is still a powerful book. It makes you wonder how you would feel, knowing how you were going to die and when. The Australians are fortunate in that they are offered suicide pills for when the pain becomes too much. People aren't so worried about nuclear war any more. But on the news this morning I saw Boris Yeltsin remind Bill Clinton that they still have a nuclear arsenal. This was after Clinton threatened Russia with sanctions if Russian forces attacked Grozny... But we've managed to avoid nuclear war up until now, so there's probably nothing to worry about. Is there?",
            "I generally post my book reviews within days of finishing them, while they are freshest in my mind. However, in a strange twist of fate, I read &#65533;On The Beach&#65533; during the second weekend in September of 2001, and I don&#65533;t need to remind anyone what happened on the following Tuesday. When I closed the book, I had chills up my spine, but at the same time I was relieved, complacently sure that the events described by Nevil Shute could never happen. After all, the Cold War ended years ago. Then, just days later, the world as I knew it was suddenly changed, and the impossible was possible once again. During those first few surreal days after September 11th, I found my thoughts returning to this book time and time again as I stared at the horrifying images on my TV screen and listened to the chilling speculation about what would happen next. But each time, I consciously pushed it out of my mind, because it was suddenly hitting a little too close to home.Even before the specter of nuclear war became a more tangible threat, this was a frightening book because it&#65533;s so realistic (despite the scientific inaccuracies &#65533; keep in mind, this was written half a century ago). Other reviewers have complained that there&#65533;s not enough action, but think about it &#65533; if you knew you were going to die in a few months and there was nothing you could to do to prevent it, what would you do? I think most of us would find ourselves spending our final days more in the manner of Shute&#65533;s characters than like anyone in a Bruce Willis film. We&#65533;d be the young married couple, tending our prized garden and cherishing our baby daughter. We&#65533;d be the lonely naval commander, dreaming of the wife and children we lost. We&#65533;d be the party girl, cramming in all the good times we could. In other words, we&#65533;d be doing what we knew for as long as we could, until we were forced to face the unknown. Maybe we&#65533;d try something we&#65533;d always dreamed about, like the Grand Prix, if the opportunity came along. Maybe, like Moira, we&#65533;d grow a little, and salvage something out of what remained of our life. But there wouldn&#65533;t be any Hollywood style heroics to save the universe. If you&#65533;re looking for a Die Hard type action adventure story, this is not the book for you. If you want a subtle, thought provoking psychological drama, it is.",
            "I had feared 'On the Beach' would be a overly macabre post-apocalytical (nuclear war) story since it was written back in the early years of the cold war when folks were scrambling to build their personalized bomb shelters. But in fact Nevil Shute writes a story that is compassionate and largely realistic. Despite being written fifty years ago 'On the Beach' feels very fresh and topical. And the author was clearly a fine writer. The prose and characterizations are uniformly excellent.Now back to the story, we have a small town in southern Australia waiting for the radiation from the nuclear fallout of WW III to arrive and ultimately kill everyone (..the rest of the world has been wiped out, with only the folks in the remote southern hemisphere still unaffected). We have several families trying to get on with normal life knowing their days are numbered. These people are experiencing the width and breadth of life: parents tending to young children, people still desperating wanting love, and those who have recently lost loved ones. Yes, the ending is what you might expect. Yet amongst all the tragedy the author had his characters behaving in a dignified fashion, which is my only quibble with the book. I would have expected more chaos and panic.Bottom line: a sobering yet slightly sugar-coated view of mankind dying off planet Earth. Strongly recommended.",
            "The beach, when one beholds it as such, is the end of the world.Nevil Shute's incredible novel is not about surviving a global nuclear holocaust. The reader will follow the lives of several people, some of whom are related, some who are friends, and some who have been brought to Australia by inevitability. One of these strangers, Dwight Towers, is an American commander for the U.S. Navy who oversees a vital submarine mission to the United States' western shores. And there the servicemen will observe, on the beach, the unsettling lack of human life.When not commissioned, Lieutenant Commander Peter Holmes lives with his brand new family, Mary and his young baby Jennifer. There they spend their days living in labored bliss, on the beach, and frequently visited by family friend Moira Davidson, a young blonde in her 20s whose hobby was once gin, but is now brandy. She consumes more liquor than even Alistair MacLean can wave an empty glass at. Though her disposition is one of genuineness, she begins enticing the submarine captain Dwight into falling in love with her. By the end of the tale, Moira becomes the most beautiful and haunted character and her faithfulness and loyalty brought me to tears more so than any other character.Shute's novel frightened me. We are, all of us, led to believe that much of Fate is in our own hands. Every day we make decisions that affect the rest of our lives, and this we do not need to be reminded of. What we forget, however, is how fragile and ephemeral our lives are, and at any given moment, our lives are not necessarily in the hands of God, but very possibly in the hands of other human beings. It is worthwhile to remember, lest we forget, that all humans err.It is only at the very end of the book that some of the characters, who have been living a life restrained, must finally accept the truth. Peter states, \"[I]f a couple of hundred million people all decide that their national honour requires them to drop cobalt bombs upon their neighbour, well, there's not much that you or I can do about it\" (229). The small matter of pride is what tears marriages and friendships apart. Unfortunately, it can also destroy the world.It is so subtle, it is easy to overlook, but Shute's motif with beaches pervades the story and ultimately becomes the one thing that never changes.I read the 1963 Signet edition. My dictionary dash consisted of \"sedulously\" (31).",
            "This book is awful. Truly awful. Spectacularly awful. If you oppose book burning, this book will make you change your mind.I ordered On the Beach for my Kindle after reading the good reviews. Ignore those reviews. If there is one review that you should heed, it is this one. Do not buy this book. Do not read this book. Don't even think about it.I've read many \"end of the world\" novels and this is the worst. It may actual be the worst book I've ever read, period. Just think about this for a moment - the world ends in a nuclear war, but the events of the book take place in Australia, which didn't get nuked. It is like reading a book about a football game, but from the perspective of someone sitting in their living room at home... except that person didn't even watching the game on TV. He heard that it was played, but is working on his garden and drinking brandy instead.That being said, I was expecting a book about how the characters prepare for the oncoming radiation in an attempt to survive. Nope... the first 20% of the book is basically about a guy taking a girl out for drinks. Don't believe it? I'm warning you. After getting 50% of the way through the book, the reader is treating with exciting plot details such as people planning their garden, finding old pogo sticks, mending torn socks and sewing buttons on shirts. Don't believe it? I'm warning you. It is the most boring plot in the history of literature. I'm just scratching the surface here... there are pages and pages of gibberish to delight the reader.You want excitement? Let's explore Chapter 5 (because it is short). Chapter 5 starts with a guy delivering a play pen. Not enough action for you? Shortly after that, the reader is treated to a tour of an art museum. Still need more action? Then a guy goes to a store to buy a fishing rod and inquires about a pogo stick and jewelry. Chomping at the bit after all this? Then the author describes two people going out to dinner and a movie. Uhhh... this is the end of the world, right? Uhhh... oh wait... I forgot that I'm a dolt of some sort who probably just doesn't appreciate the unique twist on the \"genre\" or some such nonsense.Oh... and do you know what creative and exciting things the people of Australia do to prepare for the oncoming cloud of radiation and certain death? They move up fishing season (about 75% of the way through the book). Then, they move up the date of the Australian Grand Prix so as to get the race in before the radiation hits. No... I'm not making this up. I couldn't make up such a dumb plot on my own - I had to actually read something this ridiculous.To make matters worse, the book seems like it was written by a middle school student. If you were foolish enough to buy this piece of garbage after reading this review, turn to chapter three and read through it counting the number of times the author uses the word \"they\". Also, as some other reviewers have noted, don't bother trying to figure out which person the author is talking about most of the time. It is nonsensical. Finally, the chapter breaks make no sense at all. Each chapter is just one series of events stacked on another. The chapter breaks appear to be merely dropped in at random to break up the monotony.If you are a masochist, you may choose to ignore my advice and read this revolting swill anyway. If that is the case, a small part of me thanks you - because you will realize in short order that this book review is the greatest, and most accurate, review ever written. It's the Nostradamus of book reviews - predicting your misery before it happens.If I had purchased a hard copy instead of the kindle version, I would have burned it immediately upon completion. The dry paper pages of this abomination were meant to burn.If you want to read a good book, purchase Swan Song.",
            "What would you do if you knew you had only seven or eight months to live? What exciting dreams would you want to live out before your last days? Who would you want to live them out with? How would you tell everyone you loved goodbye? These are only a few of the questions that are proposed by Nevil Shute&#65533;s On the Beach. On the Beach is a persons depiction of how a society would act if they knew that a radioactive death cloud was coming to consume their lives. It shows the struggles that a group of friends have in dealing with the death of their nearest loved ones along with their own.One of my criticisms is the characters in this book. The characters were remarkably calm and orderly. Shute describes his character in great detail. Shute uses all the methods of indirect characterization. When Peter and Mary are talking about garden plans for next summer despite the fact that they will die in a few months (speech); peter thinking to himself that he should pull the tree out of the ground for next years crops (thought); Peter actually pulling the tree out of the ground (action); Peter getting in his best suit to take the pill that will end his life (appearance); and the fact that everyone assumed that Peter would stay by his Navy ship&#65533;s side because it was the honorable thing to do (reputation) all characterize Peter as a calm and orderly guy. In fact, every character mentioned in this book is calm and orderly. It&#65533;s not how Shute characterized his characters that I dislike but, It&#65533;s what he characterizes them like. There were behind-the-scenes comments on drunkenness and fights in the streets, but this was reported rather than seen, and always in disapproving tones. Perhaps middle-class Australian people (and American Submarine Captains) really did behave like that, but from what I&#65533;ve read of people&#65533;s (especially sexual) during World War Two, I doubt it. Also, I found the lack of any attempt by society as a whole to survive rather strange. Knowing for over a year that the radioactive dust was on its way, there seems to have been no attempt to build a bunker or any other way of surviving.I began reading this book by grabbing it when I was off to my room to go to bed. I would sit there and read until I felt ready to sleep. This worked well because for the first 3/5ths of the book there was no action. I could be rest assured that if I wanted to go to sleep, five minutes of reading this book would do the trick. The problem laid in its plot. A normal plotline has the conflict at the beginning and then a rising action. Just when the rising action conflict is about to be resolved, other conflicts arise and lead to a climax. The climax is the heart of the plot you could say. The story is very downhill after this point and it is mostly a resolution. An extended &#65533;And they lived happily ever after&#65533; if you will. This type of plot line when charted out makes a pyramid shape on paper. Rises to climax and falls to resolution. Imagine for a moment looking at a plot line that is not a pyramid at all but a descending ramp. The highest point at the beginning and as you read on the ramp loses altitude and gets lower and lower with every turn of the page with nothing but a few bumps and divots hardly worth mentioning to slow your descent. Well, that is the plot line of this book. Within the first few pages it tells you that a nuclear war has happened and by the end of the book everyone would be dead. Then you slowly go down the declining plot line watching people scurry and fulfill life long dreams until the inevitable point where life ceases to exist. I find this kind of plot line very boring. You can tell it&#65533;s not a normal plot within the first few pages. This isn&#65533;t necessarily a bad thing but usually when an author makes a book about daring subjects such as death, there is a twist to the plot, you expect something good. To my surprise there were no twists, no surprises besides how physically hard it was to stay interested. All in all the plot was a major disappointment.Despite my criticisms, the novel does have some interesting points, like that of how he predicts what would happen in the aftermath of a nuclear war. Overall, On The Beach is not a bad novel, but it is not a good one as I have shown you with numerous evidence, I wouldn&#65533;t say that Shute is a good author either. The novel has an interesting idea, but its unbelievable character are disappointing. It&#65533;s an easy read, word choice is easy and story line is easy to understand. If you like action, twists, or books that keep you guessing up to the very end then this book probably isn&#65533;t for you. If you are interested in the effects of a nuclear war, or you like romance, then you might enjoy this book.",
            "The book came in 2 days. It was great not to have to wait.",
            "I thought that On the Beach was a semi-decent book. One major downfall was that it was dull and boring through a good bit of the main story. Instead of 320 pages, I believe it could have been done in about 200, to make the pace of it better. It ties in nicely with our studies in that it deals with life after a world wide nuclear war. I thought it comical that it depicted the Russians as the one of the \"bad guys\", and it didn't even mention America as being part of the war. The ending was a let down, as everyone just kind of died off with no real plot to it, except for maybe the Moira-Dwight ordeal. Basically, it was boring from beginning to end with the occasional interesting plot twist here and there. I do not agree with the quote that \"Every American should read On the Beach...\", as it was not that good. I give it a thumbs in the middle, no more.",
            "I guess I'm just not that much a fan of the classics. I read this book because my friend recommended it to me and raved about it's merits. So i took a break from the series I am reading to give \"On the Beach\" a try. What I found was what I saw as a lot of pointless nothing. Don't get me wrong, i understand the meaning of this story, the purpose it was written for, all the ironies, and why it is hailed as a classic. But the bottom line is...the book was darn boring and woefully predictable. Funny thing is, I was in a class at college and had the book out on my desk when the teacher saw it and said \"Oh I love that book, have you read this part yet? blah blah blah...you'll love the ending...\" She went on and on. So i figure the best was yet to come...little changed. Right up to the end i told myself, \"I know a shocker is coming\". The end was exactly how I predicted it to be, no surprise there at all. Not that this was meant to be a suspenseful book or anything, but since she spoke so highly of the ending i figured something odd or surprising would happen, much to my disappointment, it didn't.This book was also too depressing for me. Can't say I enjoyed that much. I know that is why it was written, and I commend the author for achieving that task of instilling a sense of depression in it's readers, but next time someone requests a book of this sort to me I will do my research. I'm a personal fan of happiness. I'm also a fan of entertainment, something this book didn't do for me.Like I say, I guess classics aren't for me. I will stick to science fiction and fantasy. This may not be true at all for you, but I know what I prefer, and it's not this book. Thank you for your time and always remember this piece of advice, \"Dont listen to what people say in these reviews, find everything out for yourself!\" funny I would say that at a time like this but there's no time like the present. Reading anything is better than no reading at all...",
            "How would you react to the inevitable destruction of all life by a slowly encroaching radioactive cloud? I can imagine a multitude of responses.The author seems content to explore a few simple variations of the same damned theme: remain calm and pleasant and display a simple-minded way of not accepting reality. It's not even a very interesting theme. Even in the our current age of peace and prosperity, there isn't that kind of homogeneity.If group reaction to extinction intriguing topic to you, I'd recommend you read Camus' \"The Plague\". If nuclear war is your particular interest, then try \"The Last Ship\".",
            "I was very disappointed to learn that 31 pages of the book I purchased were completely missing. It is very difficult to get into reading a book when that many pages at the beginning of the book are \"not there\" After a trip to the library to read the missing pages it is turning out to be an \"OK\" book. It is required reading for a high school class :(",
            "I was very impressed with the shipping time for the book. However, there was an obvious scar down the entire length of the front cover. It looked as though someone had taken a razor down the front cover and just cut through the first layer of the cover. While I was very satisfied with the book itself (it's one of my favorites), I must acknowledge the severe damage done to the book - it really is sub-par.",
            "This book was recommended after my disappointment with Cormac McCarthy's \"The Road.\" I cannot say it was an improvement.The characters in the novel are largely one-dimension with little contrast and their interactions are superficial and or stereotypical. John is the lifelong geek who finally gets a thrill. Moira falls for Dwight based on a few half-drunk interactions; this kind of quick connection is the kind of poorly-earned romance typically found in bad movies. Mary is the stereotypical housewife of the 50's whose denial of the reality of what faces her borders on stupidity (count how many times she asks if it's really going to happen to them). In fact, as a more enlightened 21st century reader, there's a lot of subtle sexism and chauvinism in the book that I found rather unpalatable. The men are pretty much all stoics and the women are the only ones showing much emotion. Dwight's by-the-book mentality, even right at the end, is a bit difficult to stomach. I also found his method of coping with grief to be a bit too much to buy -- maybe I would have if everyone else didn't have some measure of it as well.On the whole, I found most of the book difficult to accept as genuine. The author wanted denial to be an evocative and reoccurring theme of the book, but I never feel he earned it with what he wrote. Plus, he never really goes into any deeper issues of what coping with the end of humanity would be like. It's mostly kept on a mundane level. Plus, where's the diversity of reaction? Are we really to believe everyone reacts in mostly the same way? The book was emotionally empty.There was little of interest in the plot. I don't need action to keep me interested, but much of the plot seems extraneous in that it didn't really advance the story. A lot of the narration could have been excised without really losing anything.The author's writing was very unimaginative and rote. He overuses words far too much (count how many times you see the word \"presently\" and then count how many times it was unnecessary (hint: the numbers will match)). The characters often talk in very formal, stilted language. There was one bit of dialogue, no more than a page's width, that had the word \"ought\" three times. Most all of the descriptions are very plain and to the point and never access anything higher. He often introduces knowledge he wants the reader to know (such as why the war started, why there's still electricity, etc) in a forced and obvious way via dialogue through his characters.I definitely would not recommend it.",
            "After reading almost half of it, I could not bring myself to finish this book - I will just see the movie to see what the fuss is all about. For some reason this book is highly rated among lovers of apocalyptic fiction, but I fail to see why.The writing is pretty bland, the language sounds stiltedly formal and old, and the characters are not well developed at all. The main premise is also very dated to the early cold war.If you read any other reviews, you know that the novel is about the aftermath of a major nuclear war between the northern powers of Russia, China, and US. The survivors in Australia are waiting for radioactivity to spread slowly to them and kill them. In the mean time they go about their lives as usual (minus imported goods of course), whilst waiting for the bitter end.The dialog, plot, and characters are so dull that I could not bother to care if the apocalyptic premise was actually plausible or interesting.I think the reason why this book is popular is that it captures the cold war psyche of the 1950s and it influenced thinking about nuclear weapons and concern about the survival of humankind.This novel is a dated period piece. Sort of like a pre-renaissance medieval painting, which by modern standards would be ugly and primitive, but played some role in depicting the history of its era and perhaps in the history of art.Do not read this unless you are crazy about 1950s early nuclear cold war history."

        "description": "Modern treatments of Jewish apocalyptic usually terminate their discussions of this literature with the triumph of Rome over nationalist rebels at the time of the Second Jewish Revolt (132-135 CE). They hence fail to appreciate the impact of the subsequent rise of scriptural authority for the Abrahamic religions and the renewed vitality of the apocalyptic genre as a favored literary vehicle for the expression of social and cultural concerns by the major Near Eastern religious communities during the second half of the first millennium CE. The present volume begins the process of righting this imbalance by providing an English-language anthology of a series of influential Jewish apocalypses emanating from the Near East from roughly the early seventh to the mid-twelfth centuries CE. Each text is newly translated into English and provided with an annotated commentary that elucidates its historical, literary, and religious contexts. \"Paperback edition is available from the Society of Biblical Literature (www.sbl-site.org).\"",

            "Abbey's best work will always be his essays, but this novel is one of those &quot;forgotten&quot; dystopian classics that deserves much more attention. Forget Orwell's &quot;1984.&quot; It's too European. Forget Levin's &quot;This Perfect Day.&quot; It's too fantastic. Abbey has written the best post-apocalypse American novel to date. And his politics, as always, ring true. Up the rebels! An anarcho-classic",
            "Edward Abbey graduated from the University of New Mexico with a MS in philosophy. His 1959 thesis was titled \"Anarchism and the Morality of Violence.\"Clearly, many of his books are a reflection of these earlier musings. Good News is his sci-fi expression of anarchism.In Good News, society has collapsed, particularly in areas that were inhabited by high densities of humans, such as Phoenix, that required extraordinary infusions of energy, particularly west of the 100th meridian. Without energy, there was no water delivery, storage, and irrigation. No modern agriculture. No city infrastructure maintenance. No mega-transportation system.No centralized government.Jack Burns is on a mission to be reunited with his son, who he hasn't seen or contacted for over two decades. He travels with his friend, Sam, a Native American with unique powers. He falls into a crowd of anarchists who are fighting against a quasi-military government ruled by \"the Chief\". The Chief accepts execution and torture as necessary to maintain order. The anarchists want to destroy all records of government.Abbey has written, \"Anarchism is not a romantic fable but the hardheaded realization, based on five thousand years of experience, that we cannot entrust the management of our lives to kings, priests, politicians, generals, and county commissioners.\" This philosophy is expressed in Ayn Rand style in Good News.According to Abbey, this potential future is very dark, and humanity collapses as the strong bully the weak. The back cover of this book states \"With this boldly satirical imaginary world, Edward Abbey asks us to look around and take stock of what we value before it is too late.\" I would not categorize this book as \"satirical.\" I would say that this book was Abbey's continued experimentation into ways to express his dissatisfaction with the status quo in the west. After all, \"Society is like a stew. If you don't stir it up every once in a while then a layer of scum floats to the top.\"And Abbey liked his stew.",
            "Abbey is at his doomsday best with this tale that leaves a glimmer of hope that we can yet save ourselves. Say what what you want about Abbey (narcissistic, sexist, moody), the guy could write! He was also ahead of his time in his warnings about our abuse of the environment!",
            "This is not only one of Abbey's best novels but a great novel in its own right. As both a city and a country dweller I can not only relate but confirm much of his notion that cities are not nearly as healthy for a man's soul as the country is. In addition this is a great story about social decay and what it takes to over come the challanges that arise from such a situation. We have grown soft and forgetful of what our forefathers went through to create a country like ours and this book gives a realistic and easy to swallow insight into their frames of mind and their state of heart. This is the wild west and the futurama all mixed together with an iron fisted military group to boot. I still can't believe this was never made into a movie.",
            "Edward Abbey's novels displayed his Sagebrush-style conservationist ideals, and his near-Anarchist sentiments took greatest root here. This is a near-future dystopia tale in which a thinly described economic disaster has forced most people to flee Abbey's beloved desert southwest, leaving just a few hardy naturalist survivors trying to create a non-government lifestyle. Meanwhile the wasted city of Phoenix becomes the base for a big-thinking ex-military man who wants to take control of all of humanity and eliminate dissenters who stand in his way. This novel is overflowing with excellent and thought-provoking political philosophy, especially when it comes to the exact meaning of \"freedom\" and how that term is actually defined by whoever has power. Unfortunately, this book's politics may be a little outdated, because nowadays I suspect that a western power-hungry demagogue would be the exact ideological opposite of Abbey's villain here (this guy's a socialist). The novel has a few other problems, such as longwinded and tiresome monologues from the characters. Most of the action is rather predictable chase scenes, and the story is capped off by an inconclusive ending, which cries out for a sequel that never appeared. This is a very hard-hitting and thought-provoking novel, but Abbey's basic ideas are better defined elsewhere. [~doomsdayer520~]",
            "What is amazing about Abbey is how much I buy into his worldview of nasty cities sucking the life out of people and the few free men going out into the country and living off the land. Abbey writes modern Westerns and this one takes place after the infrastructure of the world collapses. An amazingly fun read, I find myself at odds with...I love living in the city, I love traffic, pollution, car horns blaring and noisy upstairs neighbors. Yet I also for a brief time can completely get into Abbey's point of view and that alone makes this a great book",
            "It's a great book, but there are two obvious typos in the Description: \"a new breed or settler\" should be \"a new breed OF settler\", and \"remnats\" should be \"remnants\"."
