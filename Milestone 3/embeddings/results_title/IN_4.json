            "The Civil War Reader by Richard B. Harwell is a combination of both the Confederate and Union Readers making this an indispensible companion to anyone interested in the Civil War. By combining both readers in one volume you can cross reference accounts across both sides of the conflict giving you a better picture as to what really happened.Here the participants describe in their own words the bitterness of the conflict making reading this book realistic as the animosity, battlefield scenes of heroism and horror reach up and grab for your attention.Like all history, time dimmes the recollection till there is no one left to tell what happens, only the written word is left to tell the succeding generations what had transpired. But so much we forget. The war was more than Lincoln and his generals and his Cabinet, more than battles and heros. The South and the Confederates in this reader is a rough chronological selection from the writings of the times, the writings that were, theoretically at least, available to the Confederate reading public. And here, more than about any other period, the South has felt it necessary to explain itself. Hardly was the ink dry on General Lee's farewell at Appomattox before the South began its attempts to vindicate in print its course during the war. the War of Separation, the War of Yankee Aggression.This record left by these printed evidences of Confederate life is the truest record of the war. Prejudiced and incomplete as it is, it is nevertheless an accurate picture of the Confederacy, left for posterity. I found this to be one of the best books on both sides of the war as the people who were there, wrote what they felt to be true, giving the reader a glimpse into the psyche of the war.America in 1861 was still a new country. Just as the war was a test of democratic principle it was a test of democratic education. Never before had there been so literate an army. Such a soldiery was ready, and proud, to relate its experiences. That is why we as the posterity can read eyewittness accounts that recall events in detail just as if we were there ourselves.This is an excellent, cogent, and fast read, but filled with copoius detail, making this an excellent choice for your library."

My plan was to spice up Foote's already excellent narrative by looking up quotes in the Oxford book from the personalities in the chapter I happened to be reading in the Foote book. In this way I would get more insight into these persons.But this idea didn't work out well. Often the general I was inspired to find out more about in Foote's book had either no quotations at all in the Quotation Dictionary or the quotations that were there offered little insight into the person who said it.On the other hand, there were many interesting quotes by Lincoln, but not enough to make up for my disappointment about generals' quotations.Just my two-cents worth."

However, there is no reason to disbelieve him and reading about first hand encounters with Jefferson Davis and many other Southern leaders is very helpful in understanding the reasons for this terrible American tragedy.His life includes attending the Naval Academy aboard the USS Constitution; months at sea on a sailing steamer raider, numerous boardings and sinking of US merchant ships, encounters with Moroccan desert cave dwellers, moving in high social circles, hunting kangaroo in Australia, and more.A spine tingling tale."

        "reviews.text": [
            "This great book tells the often overlooked women's stories from the American Civil War. Even more specific, it focuses entirely on Southern women from that era, who wrote vivid descriptions of life on the homefront during the bloodiest war in American history. From brave spies like Rose Greenhow to nurses like Emily Mason, their stories are all collected here. There's also a chapter on Loreta Velazquez, a Cuban woman who disguised herself as a man \"Lieut. Harry T, Buford\" and served as a courier for (Confederate) General Barnard Bee during the Battle of Bull Run on July 21, 1861! After the battle she even asked General Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson for a promotion! There are also stories about women during the sieges of Vicksburg and Charleston as well as the infamous Richmond \"Bread Riot\" in 1863 (not a proud moment for the Southern belles!). There's a short but interesting section on \"Stonewall\" Jackson's widow, Mary Anna Morrison. Southern women were very passionate about \"the Cause\" and even in the war's final months many still hoped for a Confederate victory. Without a doubt, they made a huge impact on the morale of the Confederate troops as well as the war effort, with thousands working in factories and hospitals. During the first day of the Battle of Nashville on Dec. 15, 1864, Confederate and Union cavalry were fighting on the Belle Meade mansion's front yard, and throughout the fierce fighting Miss Selene Harding was seen standing on the front porch of the mansion, waving her handkerchief and urging the Southerners to defeat the \"Yankees\". This is just one example of the devotion felt by virtually all Southern women to the Confederacy. This book is well-written and well-organized, starting with a female witness to John Brown's Raid and ending with the trial of Mrs. Surratt (the Lincoln Assassination). This book is very helpful in understanding more about the Confederate \"spirit\" and is highly recommended to all Civil War buffs."

        "book_title": "Lee's Lieutenants: A Study in Command Vol. II",
        "description": "Lee's Lieutenants: A Study in Command is the most colorful and popular of Douglas Southall Freeman's works. A sweeping narrative that presents a multiple biography against the flame-shot background of the American Civil War, it is the story of the great figures of the Army of Northern Virginia who fought under Robert E. Lee. The Confederacy won resounding victories throughout the war, but seldom easily or without tremendous casualties. Death was always on the heels of fame, but the men who commanded -- among them Jackson, Longstreet, and Ewell -- developed as leaders and men. Lee's Lieutenants follows these men to the costly battle at Gettysburg, through the deepening twilight of the South's declining military might, and finally to the collapse of Lee's command and his formal surrender in 1865. To his unparalleled descriptions of men and operations, Dr. Freeman adds an insightful analysis of the lessons learned and their bearing upon the future military development of the nation. Accessible at last in a one-volume edition abridged by noted Civil War historian Stephen W. Sears, Lee's Lieutenants is essential reading for all Civil War buffs, students of war, and admirers of the historian's art as practiced at its very highest level.",

            "I developed a strong interest in the Civil War four years ago after reading a biography on President Lincoln that touched on how frustrated he was with trying to find competent officers to lead the Army of the Potomac. When I drove to Knoxville, Tennessee I took the audio books Gods and Generals, and The Last Full Measure by Jeff Shaara with me. The descriptions of the battle ground and unfolding battle were so vivid that I could see it clearly in my mind. By the time, I was finished with both audio books I was hooked.Since I completed both audio books by the time I drove from Utah to Tennessee, I picked up a copy of Grant Moves South (which is the story of the Union's western campaign) by Bruce Catton at Chattanooga,Tennessee when I went and saw the Chickamaga battlefield. After seeing the war from the western point of view on the Union side I wanted to see the war from the Southern point of view on the eastern campaign - that led me to this book.This book is an abridgement of the original three-volume version (the footnotes have been taken out). It is an incredibly well written book. It is a history of the army of Northern Virginia from the first shot fired to the surrender at Appomattox - but what makes this book unique is that it is a biography of around 150 Confederate officers. The book discusses in depth all the tradeoffs that were being made politically and militarily by the South. The book does an excellent job describing the battles, then at a critical decision point in the battle, the book focuses on an officer - the book stops and tells the biography of that person, and then goes back to the battle and tells what information the officer had at that point and the decision he made. At the end of the battle, the officers decisions are critiqued based on what he could have known and what he should have known given his experience, and that is compared with 20/20 hindsight.An excellent read.",
            "Bah, humbug. Having read the original 3-volume works (my parents gave it to me for Christmas of 1954), and re-read it from time to time, I found this abridgement unsatisfying and almost a mockery of the original. I recommend that any person seriously interested in the Army of Northern Virginia spend the additional money for the original.I supposed the current work would be satisfactory for a newcomer to the Civil War and might even give this work five stars. Freeman was the undisputed giant with respect to Southern History, also writing the 4-volume set \"R. E. Lee, A Biography,\" and editing the 52-volume set of the \"Southern Historical Society Papers,\" which is usually purchased as an adjunct to the 130-volume \"War of the Rebellion, Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies.\" All of these are still available (for up to $2,500.00), and they are indispensible for the committed Civil War Historian.Freeman's prose is as lively and readable today as it was when he wrote in the 1930s and 40s. In fact, I would give five stars to all his works including \"George Washington\" and \"The South to Posterity.\" I am not sorry I purchased the LL abridgement, as it is of course a good read, but not the reference the original was.So buy this abridgement, but then move up to the original or buy the original in the first place.Freeman develops all of the subordinate commanders of the Army of Northern Virginia, with a particular emphasis on Stonewall Jackson. Personnel from Major Pelham on up are treated with sympathy and respect even when their battlefield performance was not up to par. It is as if Freeman was emulating his hero, Robert E. Lee, who spoke kindly whenever possible about his people. There is no attack-dog writing here, but the reader will be able to form valid and accurate judgments from Freeman's evidence and commentary. Many of the generals featured in this work are not household names, not having been spectacular failures or featured prominently at Gettysburg. Officers like Ramseur, Rodes, Pegram, Anderson, Rosser, Early, A.P and D.H Hill, Pender, Gordon, Mahone and Field all come alive in Freeman's work, lightly in the abridgement, but thoroughly in the original.There is much to learn here, and much to be proud about for all Americans, Union and Confederate.",
            "Douglas Freeman leaves no doubt that his heart lies with the doomed Southern cause. Yet he does not on that account engage in blind worship of poor generalship. Of course this is the war as seen through the experiences of the Army of Northern Viriginia, as the title clearly asserts. It is more than that, it is one of the pioneering works that tries to take the reader into the minds of the various commanders by presenting only that information which was available to them at the time. This avoids the type of hind-sighting that armchair strategists can indulge in the comfort of their study.Freeman acknowledges some serious shortcomings in the Confederacy's efforts on the whole. For example, he points out the woeful lack of formal military education in the junior field-grade officers who were often placed at the head of a brigade without any more background than barracks-rooms tales or childhood games with toy soldiers. Their lack of foresight with respect to supply and munitions expenditure (the all-imortant, though &quot;boring&quot; logistical considerations)would negate the most meticulous plans made with map and pen and protractor.Freeman finds Lincoln to have been a more astute wartime Commander in Chief than Jefferson Davis despite the latter's military background. His complaint that southern officers were often selected more for their political connections than their military prowess is one that affected the North equally.Freeman acknowledged as well the tendency of Lee's subordinates to rush headlong into offensive operations without considering alternative methods of picking ground so as to force the enemy to come to them, thereby gaining the advantage of cover and superior position. This has almost become a commonplace but Freeman's excellent narrative provides example after example.Most importantly the power of the writing carries the reader along...this is no dry academic text. This is, as the subtitle mentions, a &quot;study in command&quot; but one marked by considerable insights into the physical and psychological limitations of the chaotic 19th century battlefield, given the primitive nature of communications -- telegraph and semaphore notwithstanding.The abridgement is judiciously accomplished retaining most of the essence of the three-volume original.Published in 1942, Lee's Lieutenants, despite the bulkiness of the original set, was carried overseas by American Army and Corps commanders for inspirational reading. One Korean war analyst mentioned that he was apprised after the war that a Chinese general kept a heavily underlined copy of the translated third volume with him.",
            "Lee's Lieutenants is the most in-depth, comprehensive study of the officers of the Army of Northern Virginia that I have ever read. Not only are the officers we here so much about, like Jackson, Longstreet, Stuart, D.H. and A.P. Hill adequately covered, but other brave and dependable officers like Early, Rodes, Pender, Ramseur, Hampton, Fitz Lee, Hood, Pelham, Alexander, Mahone and countless others including staff members of the major officers, are all given due credit and attention. One of my favorite officers of the confederate command was the young Georgian by the name of John B. Gordon. Gordan was one of those rare men who never had formal military training, but gained such a reputation on the field that as the war progressed, he became one of Lee's most trusted and able officers. The ANV had the advantage of good officers, but as the long, bloody war progressed, so many of these fine officers from the ranks of colonel to lieutenant general were killed. Freeman covers the situation in detail in the latter part of the book. The army fought its way to the very end. At this point it was an army of starving troops, few capable officers, and shattered divisions, brigades, and regiments. A detailed book that covers the officers, the battles, the strategies, and the devotion of the fighting men of the South. A must read for any student of the Civil War. I do agree with the reader who stated that the maps were not all that good.",
            "Having read the unabridged version I approached this abridgement. My experience can be described as comparing the painting of the Mona Lisa with a pencil rendition. The absence of the appendices and the explanatory footnotes together with the gouged text made less traumatic with artificial bridging (abridgement) results in nothing more than a mere pencil sketch of a true masterpiece. There is no substitute for the full version.",
            "Don't buy this. BUY THE ORIGINAL 3 VOLUME. You can try to justify why the abridgment is better but it's all a bunch of nonsense. It says this book is 900 pages; volume 1 of the full set is 700 pages, which means the abridgment is lacking most of the real story. Would you watch a version of Titanic thats 30 mins long, or would you even want someone to buy watered down versions of your work? The original is amazing, buy that one instead.",
            "Abridgements of great works in and of themselves are not a bad thing. As I read through this volume I could not but help noticing how poorly it reflected upon Freeman's original three volume work.Douglas Southall Freeman's Magnum Opus is distorted quite significantly in this abridgement. If you have not read his original work I suppose this volume will suffice. But why settle? I frequently come across the original volumes at used bookstores for around $50-$60.Mr. Freeman's writing is good literature apart from being great history. Though the original work is dated it still is a magnificient example of historical writing. Mr. Freeman's work is what got me interested in Civil War history.",
            "My uncle had read the three volume series of Mr. Freeman's work on Robert E. Lee's generals and wanted me to do the same. If I start something I like to finish it and I just didn't want to conquer the couple thousand pages in the three volumes so I opted for the one volume abridgement. It is well written, a classic of Civil War history, and gave great insight into the minds and actions of the Confederate military leadership. From reading the introduction this abridgement was made possible not by excising the main text, but by eliminating a majority of the voluminous notes and addendum material present in the three volume series. I don't know what I missed, but what remained was fascinating, extremely readable, and well recommended. At this point I would be very interested in acquiring and reading the three volume set.",
            "Very well written book that is really three volumes that looks at Lee's command of his Army of Northern VA. from the perspective of his leadership and the relationship and performance of his key generals. There is newer information on many of the individuals in this classic such as Magruder, Longstreet, Gordon and Hill but Freeman does one of the best blow-by-blow accounts of the battles then anyone. When I first read the book I was very impressed with the detail even about the Battle of Williamsburg and I clearly recall Freeman's description of Jubal Early getting shot down when trying to take redoubts not knowing that Hancock had already arrived on his left. He provides a fascinating analysis of each key officer at the beginning of each volume. The only weakness is that Freeman was a huge admirer of Lee and he accepts Jubal Early's post war philosophy that Lee did not fail but was failed by others. Note that in each volume, the character description of Longstreet grows dark as Freeman starts to write about Gettysburg. Stonewall has less luster in the book as well but in spite of that, the volumes are quite fascinating.",
            "&quot;Lee's Lieutenants&quot; was for many years, the seminal work on the Civil War. This series of volumes almost single-handedly defined Civil War military history, and was a textbook in military academies throughout the world. In fact, it was so authoritative that it focused academic and popular attention on the Army of Northern Virginia and the Eastern Theater; almost denuding the Western and Trans-Mississippi theaters of any mention at all either in the classroom, or popular histories. Although originally published in the early '30's, it is still &quot;required reading&quot; for Civil War historians in the early 21st Century. The current edition in a single volume retains the power of the original series, but without the extraneous appendices and footnotes. The result is a scholarly history that moves quickly, and holds your attention.That being said, the book certainly reflects the agenda of its author, even with (or maybe because of) skillful editing. Growing with the propaganda of the &quot;Lost Cause&quot; permeating his home and surroundings, Mr. Freeman wanted to capture many of the storis of the ANV he heard as a youth, supported by original research. In areas, this desire almost turns the prose into a Confederate Iliad, with perfect physical specimens joyfully lusting for combat. Certainly no discussion of the higher rights and wrongs of the rebellion will be found here (unusual considering that R.E. Lee opposed both secession and slavery and would've made an interesting sidelight into his pysche). That caveat in mind, this is STILL required reading for anyone seriously interested in the ANV, or command as practiced by Civil War armies. Highly recommended.",

            "This work only confirmed my belief that I must quit buying abridgments. The original 3 volume set is so much more complete. One only gets a hint of the original with this balderization. If I want an abridgment, I'll do it myself. Amazon, please get the original set on Kindle.",
            "I got this book for Christmas, but I didn't know what to expect. Dr Freeman wove a mesmerizing tapestry of war, love, sacrifice, mistakes, and agony. It's obvious he holds Lee in high regard, but why shouldn't he? Robert Edward Lee was a great Southern man, and should be treated as such. The edition I had did contain a little bit of typographical errors, but it didn't make the book any less exciting for me. The death of Stonewall seemed to haunt Lee for the rest of the campaign, not merely in command, but in Lee's heart. Dr Freeman is called the pre-eminent historian of the Confederacy....and with great reason. But, I caution you! Be wary of James McPherson's intro!!!! He's some holier-than-thou yankee so you should know what kind of baulderdash to expect with him.Dr Freeman brought Lee's Army of Northern VA to life in a fabulous way. I'm sure his CSA kin would be proud of him........",

            "I have not read this abridgement. I gave it two stars because it is still Douglas Southall Freeman, more or less. I have read the three volume set twice now and no doubt will go through it again in the future. In three volumes this is a classic of the genre, books that set the standards for all the others, just like Shelby Foote's three volume compendium. An abridgement of this type is for the novice set. My opinion is that everyone who is interested should get the three original volumes. I believe they can still be found or at least ordered.",
            ".....your time, and money, will be well used. Stephen Sears has done a one volume abridgment of one of the greatest works in the English language, and done it quite well. When this book came out in 1998, it filled a gap; Richard Harwell had written one volume versions of Dr. Freeman's other two masterworks back in the 1960's.For the uninitiated, \"Lee's Lieutenants\" is the history of The Army of Northern Virginia told from the viewpoint of those who served under the command of General Robert E. Lee. Douglas Southall Freeman's magnum opus \"R.E. Lee\" had been published in the late 1930's; Dr. Freeman was afraid that the \"other generals\" would be forgotten [and some would have been], so he published the three volumes of \"Lee's Lieutenant's\" during WWII. It quickly became a standard work for historians, and for students at every military academy on Earth. It was required reading at West Point for years, and may still be.The first two thirds of the volume focus on Stonewall Jackson, and the last one third on James Longstreet; that is proper. The others are not forgotten, which was the idea in the first place; John Bell Hood, A.P. Hill, D.H. Hill, JEB Stuart, Jubal Early, Dick Ewell, Billy Mahone, \"Maryland\" Steuart, Wade Hampton, Fitzhugh Lee, John Brown Gordon, etc., etc., etc. Dr. Freeman made the point that not every Confederate General was a hero, and that many mistakes were poured out of a bottle. Alas, he was right, BUT, there were far more good than there were bad and indifferent....Following Mr. Harwell's model, Sears had cut out all the footnotes and appendices, most of the bibliography, and much of the dialog. For 99+% of readers, this book is all you will need, or want. It will give you an excellent overview in a well written manner. I own three copies. Still...But... The full three volumes are absolutely definitive. They are not difficult to find at a decent price [\"R.E. Lee\" is difficult, and \"George Washington\" impossible]; I own two sets. While I heartily recommend the full version, I have to recognize that most people don't need to go that far. Read this; it may make you want more, and the full story will make more sense if you've read this first.",
            "Douglas S. Freeman's (1886-1953) \"Lee's Lieutenant's: A Study in Command, vol. 3 (first published in 1944 but available in an excellent new edition) is the final volume of his great study of the Army of Northern Virginia. It covers the Army from the Gettysburg Campaign, (June -- July, 1863) through the surrender at Appomatox in April, 1865.This book is lengthy, (over 700 pages plus appendices) and I initially planned to read only the opening material on Gettysburg (about the first 200 pages) in which I have a special interest. I became fascinated with Freeman's writing and with his approach to the subject and had to finish the volume.This book complements Freeman's earlier biography of Robert E. Lee, but its focus is on Lee's subordinates. Thus the long section on Gettysburg which opens the book considers in detail the actions and motivations of \"Jeb\" Stuart, Richard Ewell, and James Longstreet, three of Lee's chief Lieutenants. (A.P. Hill at Gettysburg gets less attention.) I had read materials critical of Freeman's account of Gettysburg before turning to his own writing. Even accepting much of the criticism, I was moved by Freeman's account of the Battle and I think I learned a great deal. Freeman is indeed critical of Longstreet but, in this late work, is much more measured and balanced than I had anticipated.The book continues with excellent treatments of the War in the Eaastern theater following Gettysburg. Freeman offers eloquent and judicious comments on the importance of this Battle to the Confederate cause. He treats well the Mine Run campaign in the winter of 1863 and the campaign from the Wilderness to Appomatox under General Grant which doomed the Confederacy. Freeman also examines the detachment of James Longstreet's Corps from the Army of Northern Virgina following Gettysburg, and he is critical of Longstreet's leadership while serving in Tennessee.One of the most important sections of this book is the introduction. In it Freeman gives a statement of his conclusions about the War and about the lessons he believes should be drawn from his study. There is also an excellent biographical prelude covering briefly each of the chief actors in Freeman's story. I found it useful to read the introduction first and return to it upon completing the book to focus on points Freeman was trying to make.In addition to the treatment of Gettysburg, I found Freeman's treatment of the death of \"Jeb\" Stuart and his story of the final retreat to Appomatox particularly moving and well done.Throughout the book, Freeman emphasises the toll combat took on the officer Corps of the Army. Stonewall Jackson's death at Chancellorsville was only the most severe blow to the leadership pool available to the Army. At Gettysburg and throughout the Wilderness Campaign beginning in 1864, the Confederacy lost heavily in gifted and able leaders that it could not adequately replace. The loss of command material, Freeman maintains, was a critical factor in the Confederate defeat.The book is told almost entirely from the Confederate side of the line with little detailed consideration of the actions of the Union Army. Freeman obviously had a deep devotion to the South and to its cause in the Civil War. His book is still much more a work of history than of apologetics. His judgments of commanders and battles are fair and well stated. Freeman's study remains an indespensable source for understanding our country's greatest conflict.",
            "This is one of the great works on the Civil War, and certainly the best book about the Army of Northern Virginia available. Abridged here in one volume, this work is more of a collective biography than anything. In fact, in could be called a biography of the army, as the focus of the book is not only on the general officers of the army but also on many of the men and lesser officers. The work is superbly written, with a very engaging narrative style. This is one of those rare works (especially in history) where you get so engrossed in the narrative you forget you are reading. After laying out and describing a battle in detail, Freeman proceeds to analyze it, giving special attention to the performance of each of the major players in the fight (from the commanding general down to brigadiers or even colonels) and providing an interpretation as to why each man's performance was so brilliant or so foolish. He treats other aspects as well, such as the effects of the battle on morale and strategy, as well as the political ramifications of each fight. Throughout it all, Freeman manages to remain both objective and fair.Thanks to Freeman's incredible narrative talent, the reader follows the 'life' of this tragic army from its debut at Manassas as an inexperienced but willing group of men, through the evolution to a veteran army and into a hardened and determined fighting body, and the eventual decline of that body until all that remains is a skeletal image of former greatness, a band of hearty and loyal men who surrender at Appomattox because the shedding of their blood will no longer benefit their cause. You can really feel the emotion and the desperation of the cause as Freeman describes it, and you can see the increasing burden on Lee and his lieutenants as it becomes more and more difficult to replace fallen officers after each major battle.I have two complaints about this book, both of which detract from its greatness but do not change the fact that it is one of the best Civil War books I've read. The first is the very poor maps, which are confusing and seldom show the position of the armies involved in the engagement. The second problem concerns the treatment of the army from Gettysburg on. Beginning with that battle, most of the army's operations are glazed over very inadequately, with little detail and with but a shade of the former attention to detail. Treatment of the battles of Gettysburg and Cold Harbor are especially pathetic. I don't know if this is the fault of Freeman or of Sears (who did the abridgement), but whosever it is, it hurts the flow of the narrative. If the last two years of the war could have been treated with as much painstaking detail as the first half the war was, this would be a nearly perfect book.",
            "If this abridgement serves one purpose it will inspire a future historian to seek more knowledge on the subject. The three volume edition was and is read by all who have become the great Civil War writers of today. Here is the story (without the footnotes) of the famous Army of Northern Virginia and it's commander General Robert E. Lee. The story begins a year before Lee would take command and name the army that would take on so much of his character. Each page is filled with the story of a famous campaign, and the battles that resulted. Filtered throughout is each stage of the war in the east and the Confederate commanders that served under \"Marse Robert.\" Jackson, Longstreet, Ewell, Hill (both), Early Alexander, Gordon. They are all here and so many more. You get to read how each leader developes and succeeds or fails and is usured off the stage. In and of it's self this book could be studied as a work on management and leadership. Every aspect of Lee's brillance and his flaws are covered. It is a bitter sweet story. So many of these men die as the story unfolds, and so does the Confederacy in the end. An added plus is you get to read the words written by one of the great authors and historinas in American literary history. Reading Freeman is a must if one is to have an understanding of the eastern theater, and the Army of Northern Virginia. Read the one-volume edition if you must, but a word of warning, you may get hooked and then there is no letting go",
            "The abridged volume of Lee's Lieutenants is an excellent title for anyone interested in Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. I have looked at the original 3-volume series and the only difference as one earlier reviewer points out is that the footnotes have been taken out. Given that Douglas Freeman was the editor of a Richmond, Virginia newspaper, one would expect several pages of footnotes. However, the book's essence is still retained.Freeman covers the army's life from the Seven Days' Campaign in early 1862 to the bitter end at Appamattox in April 1865. He mentions just enough detail of the battles for the reader to comprehend the importance and result of each engagement. The deeper focus is on the main officers in Lee's army and their relationship with Lee and each other.The narrative is free flowing and is easy to read without being simplistic. Indeed, while the book is just over 800 pages, I found myself reading several pages on many occasions.If you are looking for a book about the Confederate side of the Civil War's Eastern Theater, then this is your read! The only gripe I had was the few maps - there could have been more and could have been more detailed. However, there are plenty of books out there on specific engagements that can make up for the difference.Read and enjoy. Highly recommended!",
            "Even though the original three-volume version of Douglas Southall Freeman's \"Lee's Lieutenants\" is not absolutely punctilious about bowing before the altar of Twenty-first Century political correctness, if ever a historical study and a historian deserved five stars, it is this history and this historian.The book that has generated this review, however, is not the book that Freeman wrote but an abridgement, this is to say, about 800 pages rather than the 2,395 pages, plus CXLIII pages of introductory material and photgraphs, to be found in the three massive, dignified, black volumes issued by Charles Scribner's Sons at the height of the World War II paper shortages.As an abridgement of a masterpiece, this book isn't bad. But it is not the real thing.Even a little bit of Freeman is still a good thing, so four stars--but seek out Freeman's real, three-volume \"Lee's Lieutenants\"!LEC/AM/8-08",
            "You say Freeman was 'fallable\" and \"metal dectectors\" show he had some details wrong.Get a clue. Lee's slave ledgers show that virtually everything Freeman reported about Lee's kindness and anti slavery attitude was out right fraudulent. Lee regularly had slaves whipped -- and Freeman knew it. Lee sold slave children away from the mother, and Freeman knew it. Lee gave 600% higher bounties for girls, and Freeman knew it. Lee bought women and children that were not slaves, that were living free in the North, until Lee's bounty hunters found them, and sold them to Lee- - illegally of course -- and Freeman knew it.Freeman also knew, most likely, of Lee's sexually charged letters, explicit sexual letters, Lee wrote to women, not his wife, often. Lee even joked with women about sex tricks and bragged about his son's sexual conquests. Freeman knew it.But Freeman gave a completely different story",
            "I gave this to my husband for his birthday. He enjoyed it very much.Good price, also, and it arrived on time.",
            "THESE ARE THE BOOKS THAT GOT ME INTO THE CIVIL WAR 56 YEARS AGO. THEY ARE ON MY LIST OF MY FAVORITE 10 BOOKS EVER. OF COURSE THEY ARE FROM THE SOUTHERN POINT OF VIEW BUT SO WHAT. THEY MAKE YOU WISH YOU COULD HAVE KNOWN THESE GUYS; EVEN JACKSON. THEY REALLY BRING THEM TO LIFE. IF YOU ONLY EVER READ ONE BUNCH OF BOOKS ABOUT THE WAR, THEY SHOULD BE THESE.",
            "This abridged version of Douglas Southall Freeman's groundbreaking 1940's study of Lee's Army of Northern Virginia has the virtue of being much shorter than the original three volumes, and the vice of causing readers to miss significant portions of the author's thoughtful and highly readable study.Freeman, author of a Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of Confederate General Robert E. Lee, went the next step with his extended study of command in Lee's Army. Freeman identifies and narrates the military careers of the general officers who served in the Army of Northern Virginia, led by Lee from the summer of 1862. Here are Stonewall Jackson, James Longstreet, Jeb Stuart, Jubal Early, and dozens of other men who played a role in the Southern fight between 1861 and 1865, brought to life in the full context of their times. Freeman's focus is tightly set on the experiences of those generals; Lee is something of a background figure at times, while their Union opponents are all but unseen across the battle lines.Freeman's familiarity with the Army of Northern Virginia allowed him to draw some significant conclusions about the failure of the Southern military effort, including the clashes of personalties and the lack of a system to produce trained replacement officers in anything like the numbers needed. These conclusions may be less apparent in the abridgment. However, for the newcomer to the study of the Civil War, this shortened version of a still impressive study may be the place to start. Highly recommended."

            "This novel seems to be much like another Harry Harrison novel, A Rebel in Time. Both novels are placed in the civil war period, both have very interesting concepts and both suffer from severe plot pacing problems. I enjoyed this book and will read any sequels but probably in paperback next time.",
            "Alternate fiction must, by its very nature, deal in improbabilties. Who knows what could have happened if minor changes had occurred in history. I must admit that the series of event in this novel are highly improbable at best. The Union and Confederacy unite to fight a common enemy. However, the book is great fun and makes you feel good, unlike Turtledove's North/South alternate fiction, which is sort of depressing. You must suspend a certain degree of belief when reading this book, but it is a good time.",
            "I couldn't put the book down. It is my first &quot;what if&quot; book and it left me thinking. I would recommend it to anyone who has studied the Civil War. It lets your imagination flow.",
            "While the premise and beginning of this book are very plausible it soon breaks down. The author appears determined to create a situation where the CSA &amp; USA will combine against Britain regardless of how silly the action required to do this. I am also struck by the very uncharacteristic behavior of Grant in this book. One of the most fluid generals ever is portrayed fighting incompetants in the same way he was forced to fight Lee.",
            "I tend to disagree with some others who have said that the events &quot;could not have happened&quot; or are simply fantasy. The point of ALTERNATE history is to give ideas of a future that &quot;may have been&quot;,not as actually happened. In fact, the feelings Harrison evokes in his novel actually did happen during that time. This well-written novel is obviously the product of years of research and a great deal of thought has gone into this excellent book. I'll be the first to the bookstore for the other two volumes.",
            "I'm not an expert or even well read on the subject of the US civil war, but it was a damn fun read and it suggested some interesting possibilities if Britian had invaded, i'm looking forward to the subsequent sequals in the series.",
            "I'm going to be a bit more charitable to Harry Harrison than other reviewers of \"Stars and Stripes Forever\". A single second passes and becomes history, immutable, and we are all swept up in it, from events both large and small. It is easy to recollect a single instant in our own lives, question our actions, and wish that we had made a different decision, a decision that would have led to a vastly different outcome. Transfer this sentiment to a larger historical canvas and a cascade of events can ripple out from a single, seemingly innocuous focal point--in the case of the American Civil War, the death of Albert, the Queen's consort, a few weeks earlier than history records. What could have come from this, Harrison asks?Harrison's transition of Union and Confederacy from antagonists to allies is clumsy, but by no means implausible. All of the triggers were there: the pragmatic assessment of the Confederacy's position in which the tea leaves did not necessarily predict a favorable outcome; horror at the deaths of tens of thousands of soldiers who spoke the same language, worshipped the same god, and shared the same Revolutionary heroes; the necessity-of-war driven arrival of new weapons such as the breach-loading rifle and iron clad ships; an arrogant and effete British Empire. Harrison could have spent another hundred pages or so developing in greater depth the reunification of Union and Confederacy, but these pages were simply not necessary: just one small change to the historical sequence of events could certainly have led to a cascade of all of these triggers, with the unleashing of chaos and the instinctive human drive to restore order and put the cork back in the bottle.\"Stars and Stripes Forever\" also serves as a feel-good piece during our era of political polarization. The Civil War is now too far in the past; too few remember that Americans have also experienced brutal war at home, seen American cities burned, civilians deprived and killed. These stark lessons seem to have faded, but many older Americans will remember a grandparent or great grandparent who fought in that war; a 19th century bible with Confederate money marking the pages; a tin-type photograph of a soldier whose features vaguely resemble our own; trees in the wooded lot out back that still yield minnie balls to Civil War buffs using metal detectors.I found \"Stars and Stripes Forever\" to be a fun read. It is not high literature and does not claim to be anything more than what it is: a good, quick story to sate the curiosity of those of us who, as children, were fascinated by ships like the Monitor and Virginia (Merrimack), who wondered why the repeating rifle wasn't pushed into production much sooner--who wonder: What if things had been just a little different?",
            "It's nice to read an old-fashioned &quot;science fiction&quot; book where everyone is so wholesomely rational and well-intentioned, and the bad people are bilious, mad, or blundering. It is upbeat, jaunty, declarative, and reasonable. Anyone who gets really emotional isn't with Harrison's program. Actually this is more &quot;alternate history&quot; than it is a novel, hewing very close to real events and speeches. There is a huge cast of characters here, almost all of them well known or obscure historical figures, as far as I can tell. Outstanding people of the time like Lincoln and Davis, Lee and Grant, have their appointed roles or speaking parts, but there's no central fictional characters on which a personalized story, or novel, is constructed. The only bits of inadvertent &quot;SF&quot; are Harrison's tendency to condense or overlap time between episodes--producing too obvious seams in the story--or perhaps the too rapid acceptance of technical innovations.I don't think Harrison has played fair by his situation or by his readers. He sets up a circumstance under which Britain would really have entered the war on the side of the Confederacy, and effectively builds tension up to their entry. Their entry would have created enormous problems for the Federals, but instead Harrison has the British make a colossal blunder and prevents them from retrieving it. From there on the Yanks and Rebs get along famously as if there were no yesterday between them. But then, the British isn't really what this story is about, instead it's an alternative solution to the slavery question proposed by the famous political economist John Stuart Mill. Or maybe the scope will be even broader than that, a whole new 19th century world order? We'll have to see: the book ends with some very mad Englishmen, a hook for the next monster plot, the British will be back!",
            "I began reading hopeing to find something different than that of the usual negative Confederate alternate history, and this was to an extent. Harrison kind of rode the fence on the actual causations of the war in this book. While the story was great, I had a problem believeing that the Confederates would just say,'What the heck lets go back into the Union.' The secession of the states and wanted independence was what the war was fought over. The South wanted to be it's on nation. Just like the Colonists in the Revolutionary war, they wanted their own country. It would have been a tooth and nail fight for the Confederacy to join back in the Union. Would the Colonists have joined back with England if the Chinese or somebody had invaded America? NO! The Confederates wanted their own nation. However, I do believe that they would have come together to throw back an invasion, but they still would have wanted their independence. For instance, when General Bullers attacked Mississippi and asked the dying Confederate about, '...whose flag this was?' He replied,&quot;..ain't no dang yankee flag.&quot; That right their says that the South wanted independence over everything. I did however like the images of Blue and Gray clad soldiers fighting side by side. Maybe Harrison will talk more about the Confederacy's independence desires in the other two books of the Trilogy.",
            "Engrossing, optimistic and fun. Who says that alt history has to always be about things being worse, rather than better? Harrison's prose is crisp, his plotting sure-handed and if the dialog seems stilted, well, people didn't speak and write as informally in 1862 as they do now. Much of the criticism I've read seems to come from Anglophiles who seem angry that that sun has long set on the British Empire. Harrison's suggestion that America could whip the world makes sense to me. With Sherman, Grant, Lee and Jackson in command, how could a united America not knock off the Brits? I'm waiting amxiously for the next two books.",
            "Harrison is not a historian. It shows. Badly. His writing is okay -- if you happen to enjoy his somewhat unique style -- but gee whiz: there's hardly a single historically plausible idea in this whole book after the point of divergence (the British go to war over the Trent Affair). It was *drudgery* reading it after about 40% of the way through, because everytime you turned around, something else was happening that would NEVER have happened, even in an alternate world where everyone routinely did LSD. Just pitiful. The whole idea of alternate history is to show -- in an entertaining way, of course -- what *could* have been. This *never* could have been, period. If you know any more history than the average junior high student, this book will tick you off.",
            "I was sorely disappointed with this book. Harry Harrison is one of the better authors. But this book didn't just strain my disbelief suspenders, it snapped them.The original premise, the Trent affair, an excellent beginning, thoroughly believable. I was ready to really enjoy this book.The attack on Biloxi OTOH was a bit much to swallow, but given the Army Reforms in England were still half a decade in the future, and blunders nearly half as bad happened in the Crimea, I can almost believe it, with difficulty. Almost. It's a hell of a stretch though. The South and North collaborating against the foreign foe, as the result, well, maybe. As a once-off, not completely implausible, more believable that the original attack. But the Brits then just saying &quot;Oh, we attacked the wrong side accidentally? Never mind, let's just have a jolly little war against both sides for the hell of it.&quot; That's not &quot;Alternate History&quot;, that's Fantasy. They'd just as likely invade Russia, France, Prussia and everyone else at the same time to make it sporting, using bladders on a stick instead of firearms.The British armed forces of the period may have been ( actually were...) staffed with more than their fair share of incompetents, but their political officers were first rate, viz India, Africa et al. Elphey Bey excepting, but even he wouldn't have unilaterally declared war on Russia for example.The Naval Battle at the end of &quot;Stars and Stripes Forever&quot; is a farce to any Naval Architecture Historian of the period. Sort of like a cruiser crushing a battleship by dint of the cruiser's superior guns and better protection. The Monitor didn't do more than batter the Virginia, taking almost as good as it gave. Against the Black Princes' greatly superior protection, and vastly superior heavy weapons, it would have had no chance, let alone it being a cakewalk for the Monitor. But this didn't really matter, as I'd pretty much given up by then. The book is relatively well written, but this just makes the book more disappointing to anyone who knows the details of military history. Numerous minor inaccuracies re number of rounds in a magazine, sizes of guns etc show carelessness, minor pecadillos but niggling. If you're going to have technospeak about weapons, get it right. To someone who hasn't more than a superficial knowledge of history, it would be more enjoyable, hence 2 stars.",
            "This is a book that is started with a great premise, and is only undermined by the author's hurried attempts to tie it all up in the end. Too fast, too fast. The beginning of the book is great, and if the text had been expanded another 50 to 100 pages, this would have been a much better read. The British are fairly real. As a BS in Anthropology I can tell you that at that time most british royalty were very interested in the American Civil war, and its repercussions abroad. As for the utter agressiveness shown by Victoria and her ministers, it is way over the top. While there were many wars in that time fought to expand and keep the borders of the Empire, they were not THAT bull-headed. Overall, this is a good read, just don't believe how &quot;real&quot; it could be.",
            "After reading facinating 'The Hammer and the Cross' trilogy, I was ready for more by Harrison. I thought I had found it, but although 'Stars and Stripes' starts off with a bang, it squanders that promising beginning. What could have been an engrossing alternate history dwindles down to a foregone conclusion by mid-novel and all the reader is left with is page after page of stilted dialogue to wade through. That is when Harrison hasn't launched into another battle scene featuring the complete rout of the British. The Idea that the world's greatest sailors would have made such a error as to attack Bilouxi instead of Deer Island is laughable.The characterization is equally dismal. Abraham Lincoln, rather than being the stoically courageous, though somewhat depressed figure of history is relagated to being a simple yes-man who rarely disagrees with anyone. The many, many times where someone new is ushered into the President's office grow deadly dull after the first two such incidents, as do the constant, 'Well if you can do that, I will be in your debt,' pronouncements from Lincoln.I wish I had picked up something else at the bookstore. Maybe another S.M. Stirling novel, or tried one of Turtledove's AH tales.",
            "Although this sounds like a fascinating book, it is spoiled by a lifeless execution. Much of it reads like a dry and dusty history textbook, and only rarely do the historic personages &quot;come to life&quot; on the page. The saddest thing is that, now that Harrison's botched it, nobody else can do this idea the way it ought to have been done, because such an work would look like a rip-off.",
            "How can this Harry Harrison be the same one who wrote the masterful King's Way series? Mr. Harrison is apparently more comfortable and familiar with the distant past than with the relatively recent. I have seldom seen a worse example of &quot;alternate history.&quot; As we've often been told, the key to alternate history is that it must be plausible. S&amp;S is certainly not plausible in plot, characters, or sentence structure. Perhaps the safest thing for Mr. Harrison's fans to do is to view this as fantasy, not alternate history, and thereby give him (and themselves) a break from the link to reality that &quot;alternate history&quot; implies. Or perhaps they should do as I have done: choose to believe that an evil force from a parallel timeline has substituted a poor imitation of a good writer for the genuine article.",
            "As a Civil War buff and alternate history addict, I found this book to be a huge disappointment. The premise of U.K. intervention as a result of the Trent affair is a good one, but that is the only positive thing I can say about this work. The dialogue was dreadful, the characters unconvincing, the research slip-shod, and the editing worse. The story-line, with its preposterous British invasion of the South, transcendantly goofy North-South reconciliation, and bizarro Victoria just made me wince. It simply was an insult to the genre.",
            "Although the premise is great, I had to plod through this book. Other reviewers have mentioned the great deal of improbabilities running through this book; as a non-historian, I do not feel qualified to comment further on that. However, I simply found the writing not interesting (and at times downright BAD), the characters thinly drawn (if not merely used as caricatures), and the plot weak --- pivotal battles won in one chapter?? Come on. For my money, the alternate history books of Harry Turtledove are so much better --- richly textured writing and complex characters, the use of tried-and-true historical figures in novel situations as well as multiple everyday people as main dramatis personae. Another reviewer liked Harrison's works more than Turtledove's becuase Turtledove is &quot;depressing.&quot; All I can say is that these are books about war. War and death and killing and the stench of the battlefield probably are all depressing. You want good writing, read Turtledove; you want schlock, read this.",
            "Ok so the premise for the book is a good one, one star earned there. But the execution is retarded. For one, HH has the United States progress through four years of industrialization in a matter of months, completely ignoring the obvious impossibilities of such a rapid change in 1861. Second, how the hell could three/four corps conquer America and reincorperate the Americans back into the British empire, the limeys were not stupid as they are in this book. Basically the book completely devolves into a series of mindless drivel, entertaining drivel, one star.",
            "This book was a quick read and once I accepted it as a piece of pro-American pulp fiction with corresponding weaknesses, I rather enjoyed it. I understand and agree with many of the complaints of other reviewers. The conduct of the British troops in Biloxi is not unreasonable considering that the British Army was unprepared for modern warfare. A long sea voyage, brutal combat and the discovery of strong drink could cause a break of discipline in 19th Century troops. In our current PC era, this will of course anger some people. I agree with Brian Glass' comments regarding the interview with Harrison at the back of the book. Harrison comes across as a stodgy old-timer, pining for the &quot;good old days&quot; and jealous of the success of younger writers. I am not inclined to seek out his other works at this time. Overall, if one has read all of Harry Turtledove's alternate histories, is not an anglophile and is looking for a light read to pass some time, this would be a satisfactory choice.",
            "I greatly enjoyed Harrison's &quot;Stars and Stripes Forever.&quot; It was a far more cheerful alternate history than Harry Turtledove's &quot;Greatwar&quot; Series, but that in and of itself was the problem with the book. Nothing went wrong, for long, for the US. Still, overall, a great and enjoyable read.",
            "I really enjoyed this book as I was reading it but after reading the reviews the few problems I had with it were magnified. Several people point out battles are very one-sided. I did wish for a little more suspense and conflict. There wasn't any real threat from the British, it was just a matter of how the US troops would defeat them. Speaking of the British, I've noticed several readers from England were insulted by the treatment of the Brits as maniacal rapists and cartoon villains. That was the point, they were after all the bad guys. I would have much rather seen a more complex depiction. I didn't care for the one dimensional characterizations. I also thought that in the interview in the back of the book Mr. Harrison cops the old timers attitude that today's science fiction readers and writers are inferior to the old school authors. It's pretty risky to insult your audience like that. He doesn't come across as a progressive thinking scince fiction author but rather a cranky oldster (and a little conceited as well).I still enjoyed the book but liked Harry Turtledove's Guns of the South alot more.",
            "Having read Stars and Stripes Forever, I eagerly awaited the next installment. It was worth the wait to read Stars and Stripes In Peril. But I was very disappointed, for several reasons. The main one is Harrisons interpretation of the the difficulties in Ireland. Very simplistic and very grand. here is little in the way of the bitterness of the past and indeed of the present in the book (the time period). The oversimplistic viewpoint on the depredations of the Europrean powers in Mexico. It was all too clean cut. A previous article dealt with Lincoln, indeed he appears to be a simple yes man. A good read, but not too hot for Irish readers, even though Irish liberation in the 19th century would have saved a lot of grief. Michael Vernon, Co. Armagh, Ireland.",
            "This is the third AH book I have read about the Civil WAr era. I find that this book holds its own against the other two. My problems with this book didn't start until after I finished reading the book, and read the afterword. For Harrison to state, &quot;Events, as depicted in this book, would have happened just as they are written here.&quot; is laughable. If not crazy of him. After reading that line I began pick holes in the book. It was hard for me to believe that the North and South could unite again so easily. As if all they needed was some spark to make them forget why they broke up in the first place. Especially when you consider that all those reasons are still their when they reunite. I also found that the rapid growth and adoption of US technology was a little too unbelievable. Harrison asks you to close your eyes to believe his story, but then he goes and says it his all true. It was too much for me. I also found it hard to picture a sequal. To me after was wrapped up to neatly to suggest a sequal. The only thing we as readers can think and argue about in the long, long time in betweens books is this vague British response. Their is no cliffhanger at the end of this book to make you go out and get the next one.",
            "I like to read alternate history stories. Some of my favorites are S. M. Sterling and Harry Turtledove. And I liked this one pretty much too. I will want to see how the war between the United States and England comes out and will read the rest of the series.",
            "I love books like this, if they are well done and at least on some level believable. Unfortunately, this one is neither. The author obviously has not bothered to research the period at all and most of the action frankly makes no sense. Is it possible the North and South would have joined together? I suppose so. In fact I commend Mr. Harrison for not portraying the Confederates as one dimensional, evil villains as so much other fiction does. That said, it does not seem plausible. Especially considering that they joined forces after the British ACCIDENTALY attacked the South. The most powerful Navy in the world can't tell Mississippi from an island? Apparently in Harrison's world the British are all buffoons and the unbreakable Union could defeat anyone simply because they are American. Overall, the book is a disappointment. I give it 1.5 stars, mainly for the idea.",
            "The Premise for this book is pretty good(a British invasion of both the CSA and USA). It kept me reading constantly and seeing blue and grey fight beside each other is a real treat in itself. This book is Alternate History at it's best.",
            "Stars and Stripes Forever is indeed a enjoyable read. However there two problems with this first novel that I can see that hopefully will be corrected in the next one. The first is that the darker side of America should be portrayed a little more evenly. America and the Americans are to honorable in this novel, and England too much the antaganist. I wish that the novel dove into the complexities of the English spirit more. We must remember that The English empire DID have its dark and dirty side. They lost the war of 1812 with the Americans and that did not sit well with them at all. There appeared to be a subconcious fear of this contry. If fact England felt uncomfortable with America until just before WW2 and it is very easy to see the Trent Incident begining a road to war. I am also suprised that Harry didn't add a French invasion of the U.S. from the west. I am sure that the French would definitely see us as a long term threat. Maybe in the future novel... The dialog is pleasant and appears to correspond well to the 1800's style of speech in the US. Again this book is a great start to the Stars and Stripes trilogy, worth reading several times to get the Feel and flow of a good Alternative historical yarn.",
            "First, in praising Mr. Harrison's work, I see no reason to disparage Harry Turtledove's works, amongst which Guns of the South and his present Great War trilogy I very much enjoy. Mr. Harrison's work which I have trouble understanding why it was published across the pond first, is an excellent romp through what might have been had Secretary Sewards idea of a mutual enemy actually come to fruition. As to Mr. Harrison being a closet anglophobe, let's keep in mind that though an American author, he's lived the last twenty years on John Bull's Other Island. As is frequently the case in English History, it all turns on Ireland. Though we have a great deal to answer for on this side of the pond for the last 400-500 years in our treatment of the original inhabitants and the poor souls we stole from the coasts of Africa, we are but poor pikers in comparison to how Mother England has treated Eire for the last millenium or so. But enough, Winnie's halfbreed eloguence points the way to the next. As has been documented, Albert's gentle way with Vickie is one of the primary shining lights of the Victorian Age. I can easily imagine her going off the deep end. One of the really neat bits in this work is the chance for Mary Todd Lincoln to find a setting in which she can more easily keep her bearings and sanity. What I find more over-the-top is Palmerston and the other ministers who'd I'd expect to be a little more dispassionate than represented here. Seeing Jeff Davis as a more sympathetic rather than merely noble figure is a nice touch. Seeing how the battle hardened Confederate veterans deal with South Carolinian hotheads is especially gratifying to this Yankee now living and teaching in Jesse Stuart's Heart of America; Kentucky. All in all a most enjoyable read, I look forward to the next volume in the trilogy.",
            "Stars & Stripes Forever is the first novel in a trilogy about a Civil War that didn't quite happen. In our timeline, on November 8, 1861, the USS San Jacinto, an Union warship, stopped the Trent, a packet ship flying British colors, in the Bahama Channel and took off two Confederate diplomats, John Slidell and William Murray Mason. Since the packet ship belonged to a neutral power and the boarding occurred on the high seas or, in some views, within British colonial waters, the US warship had committed an act of war. The British public responded with a great outcry and the Queen and her ministers were infuriated. Prince Albert, however, persuaded the Queen to moderate their response and a firm, but not inflammatory, note was immediately passed to the US government and eventually the two diplomats were released.In this novel, Prince Albert tries to calm his wife but is too ill to be effective; in fact, he passes out and has to be carried to his bed. Thus, the note generated from this meeting is markedly different in tone from that of our timeline. The note is hand carried to the US Secretary of State, Sewart, with a request for an immediate answer. The US Cabinet, however, is divided on the response, but agrees to have the ambassador to Great Britain, Charles Adams, meet with Lord Palmerston to negotiate a compromise settlement. However, the British are not in the mood for compromise; Lord Palmerston has already considered withholding military supplies from the Union and is sending additional troops to Canada. Then there is a firefight between Canadian whiskey smugglers and a customs patrol that is reported to England as an invasion of Canadan territory. The British issue an ultimatum: seven days to return the Confederate prisoners and apologize for the invasion or there will be war.When the British invade from Canada, they are met by New York militia, who take heavy casualties. Additional British troops under the command of the Duke of Cambridge, Commander-in Chief of the British Army and the Queen's cousin, have been sent to the Gulf of Mexico in an attempt to take Deer Island, a Union bastion offshore from Mississippi, but miss their landing in the fog and instead attack a Confederate installation in Biloxi. Learning of the mistake, the Duke continues to push the attack in order to meet up with the Canadian invasion force, thereby splitting the country.Under intense pressure from the British, CSA General Beauregard requests an armistice from General William T. Sherman and instead is given a temporary alliance against a common enemy. Word of the unexpected attack and this cooperative response galvanizes both the North and South, leading to a ceasefire and talks of reunion.Moreover, General McClellan is hospitalized with a fever and Lincoln seizes the chance to relieve him as General of the Armies; he appoints General Sherman as his replacement. Due to his actions in Biloxi, the CSA agrees that Sherman will also be Commanding General of the Joint Armies of the Union and the Confederacy.In the meantime, a tragic fall from his horse sends a paralyzed General Ripley, Chief of Ordnance, to the hospital. His aide, General Ramsey, is chosen as his replacement and immediately initiates changes to modernize Army weapons, starting with replacement of the standard rifle with breechloaders and equipping marksmen units with the Sharps rifle. The spirit of innovation also pervades the Naval Department, leading to orders for more of Ericcson's iron ships and for Parrott's interrupted screw breechloader cannons. Formerly a mostly rural society, this new war causes an infant military-industrial complex to stretch its muscles and produce new weapons and tactics.The Civil War was never as popular in the Union as America's previous wars. There were many opponents of the War who were shouted down by the vocal proponents and even imprisoned for their protests. A civil war just didn't sit well with many people and too many families were split down the middle. A war with England, however, would have been rather popular in the North, particularly after so many English ships were blockade runners.The South had a warmer attitude toward England, mostly due to these blockade runners, but still had differences of opinions, especially about the British Navy backed embargo against the shipment of slaves from Africa. The current British government irritated both North and South with its arrogance assumptions of superiority. Another war with England would probably be much more popular in the Confederacy than the ongoing Civil War.The permanent reunion of these two American nations, however, would depend on a stronger commitment to resolving their disagreements. The new spirit of cooperation can only strengthen that possibility, yet many differences must still be overcome.This book sticks close to the actual history, both in events and in the personalities. The fictional events, moreover, are much like actual events that occurred elsewhere; for example, the British mistakes in the Gulf reflect actual problems in their other wars in that century. The navigation of that time, particularly in open boats during foggy weather, was generally much less than precise and British troops of that era were frequently undisciplined in victory. The critical reviews of this story, on the other hand, often are achronistic in viewpoint, reflecting present day standards and capablilities.The major criticism that can be made of this series is that the author selects among those possibilities that will support his story line. The author almost certainly started with a specific conclusion and then followed the possibilities backwards to the point of divergence. This practice is much like reverse engineering and is used even among working scientists. Maybe the probabilities are slim and maybe not, but it is nevertheless a legitimate strategy for plotting a work of fiction. It is the practice of \"What if\" and who can say that these events could never have happened.The author is known mostly for his Stainless Steel Rat series, but has also produced several alternate timeline stories, including Tunnel Through the Deeps, The Rebel in Time, and the Eden series. While not as verbose as Harry Turtledove, his stories have the same tone of good research and believable characters. Both often bring a personal touch and ethnic viewpoint that enliven their works and both are among my most favored authors.Recommended for Harrison fans and anyone who enjoys well-crafted tales of alternate wars.-Arthur W. Jordin",

            "When I studied history in college my professors told us never to play the &quot;what if&quot; game. Of course,such speculating was too much fun to resist. Now it seems to be a healthy subgenre of science fiction, growing in popularity. My old professors must be appalled. Harrison's foray into the genre starts from one of the &quot;what ifs&quot; we also used to play with : what if the British had declared war over the Trent incident. Harrison's handling of that divergence is good, and he gets much else right,especially the way 19th century people thought and spoke, but too much of the book is implausible. By having North and South reunite so quickly and enthusiastically, I fear Harrison sells short the powerful animosity between the sections. Likewise, Harrison has Jefferson Davis persuaded to give up slavery after one easy lesson in economics. Racism and memories of Nat Turner would've kept slavery going despite John Stuart Mill's best arguments. The book's other flaws: no central fictional characters for us to follow through the action. The war itself is the main character, and this is of interest primarily to military buffs. In his afterword Harrison asserts he has written what would've certainly happened given his Trent divergence. The whole point of alternate history is nothing is written in stone.",
            "Actually, the basic premise, the British declaring war over the Trent Affair is quite plausible. The British then invade the US from Canada.Remotely realistic scenarios end there. The British accidently attack Biloxi, MS, instead of Deer Island. When the commanders realize that they have attacked a Southern port (mistaking the First National Flag for the US flag) they decide to loot Biloxi, burn it to the ground, and rape most of the women. I suppose the gray uniforms, instead of blue ones, weren't enough to tell the British they were fighting Confederates. Biloxi is also the last battle that the British win against the Americans. So the Americans sweep through Canada and free it as the Republic of Quebec.The author doesn't even make an attempt at surprising his audience. More often than not, books which title individual chapters give them somewhat abstract names that only hint at the chapter's subject: \"Councilman\", \"University\", \"Collision\" (from Foundation's Edge by Isaac Asimov). Not Harrison. One chapter in Stars and Stripes is actually entitled \"Washington City is Attacked!\" I wonder what might happen in the next few pages. Might the British actually attack Washington city! I wonder if they'll win.Also the historical characters are paper-thin. Harrison never sticks with a main character for more than a handful of pages in the entire book. (Quite unlike Harry Turtledove who can put out well over 500 pages on just two people -- Guns of the South).The conflicts are very underdeveloped and too easily ended. For instance, not only do the CSA and USA ally against the UK; they decide to reunite entirely, and do away with slavery, even though Emancipation would not even become an issue in the Civil War until 1863. Before then the North was fighting to \"Save the Union.\" And lter, while Davis is in a meeting with his cabinet discussing manumission, a character never mentioned before walks in and shoots him. All of the North-South problems are supposed to be solved in the end by making Judah P. Benjamins the Secretary for the South, like having a new cabinet position could cause everyone to just forget about decades of tension that had brought them to armed conflict.And lastly, as a Southerner, I was almost offended by the fact that William T. Sherman was put in command of the American forces. I realize he hadn't burned Atlanta down at this point, but any other Northern commander -- Grant, Meade, heck even McClellan or Hooker -- would have been much better.",
            "It's weird. Harrison obviously did _some_ research. So why did he not go the full length to make it accurate? There are many, many problems with the ships in the book, problems that could have easily been fixed if he had bothered to find a single good reference book. The Warrior in the book is not the same ship as in real life and would have been far more than a match for the Monitor. For that matter, the Monitor succeeds because the British are &quot;strawmen&quot;, designed specifically to fail. I didn't take as much offense at the North and the South joining forces against Britain (when the actual Trent Affair occured, some members of Lincoln's cabinet actually thought a war with Britain might bring the two sides together), but its execution in the novel is rather hackneyed.I didn't bother with the other books in the series. I was totally turned off by this one. Go read something by Harry Turtledove if you want Civil War alternative history.",
            "This trilogy starts with a good concept but delivers it so badly........Characterisation (mostly of the British) isn't even two dimensional; they are poor stereotypes at best. But even the Americans are flat and lifeless.Also, if an author is going to write about historical warfare it behoves him to do some research, the number of simple errors in these books is terrible.Amusing but not worth the effort.",
            "I admit it, I had fun with Harry Harrison's &quot;Stars and Stripes Forever.&quot; Despite a couple of minor historical errors, Mr. Harrison has written a historical novel that feels historical. The characters and their voices belong to the ninteenth century, not the twentieth. This will irritate the sort of reader who thinks Lincoln sounded like a TV news anchor, but it is a nice change from Victorian infantrymen who seem to have fallen out of a James Jones novel. &quot;Stars and Stripes Forever&quot; is not &quot;The Stainless Steel Rat Saves the Union&quot;, but it's worth a look if you understand that the Civil War happened in the 1860's, not the 1960's. It is also a nice counterpoint to Harry Turtledove's unquestioning worship of the Confederacy. Thanks Mr. Harrison.By the way, the historical errors are on pages 45 &amp; 284 where the New York draft riots happen more than a year before conscription went into effect in March 1863; and on page 69, when &quot;Stanton&quot; attends a cabinet meeting on December 25, 1861, three weeks before he became Secretary of War on January 15, 1862. There is also some geography trouble on page 85 when Tenessee and Kentucky switch places.",
            "I was hoping for a much more belivable alternative history. The point of divergence was an excellent one -- the British almost did go to war with the U.S. over the Trent Affair. But even if the British were to accidently attack the Confederacy instead of the Union, would they just say &quot;hey, what the heck&quot; and continue on and battle both sides? Utter foolishness. I couldn't take this novel seriously after that. Skip this one and stick to Harry Turtledove's works in alternate history.",
            "I'd prefer to just comment on this book rather than judging how good or bad the British were to the Irish in history or how kind the Americans are or are not. This is a fantasy book not an historical evaluation of Anglo-American history. Whether the English mistreated the Irish or the Americans the Africans is surely not that relevant to the actual style and enjoyment of the book.The book is a great disappointment. There is very little tension or excitement with predictable victories following predictable triumph. The outcome is never in doubt. The British are portrayed as being unbelievably inept and stupid. They are pathetic adversaries with blatantly no chance of victory. This is a fairy tale with a predictable American victory over vilified evil enemies. The re-uniting of America is comical. The Americans are always lucky with the right forces turning up at just the right time, again and again. I could forgive this good and evil potrayal of the differnt sides if the book had been good but sadly it is not.Overall it is just dull. Unless you enjoy watching seal clubbing then you must find this book tedious. The characters are wooden and the dialogue from a pantomime. Harry Turtledove's &quot;Guns of the South&quot; and &quot;How few remain&quot; are much more believable and exciting with neither side having to be vilified. This book is simply Anglo-phobic wish fulfilment.I really wanted to enjoy this book but ended up finishing it as a chore. Undoubtedly the American history has been well researched but Harry Harrison's strong claims that this is how it really would have happened failed to convince me. If you are looking for an exciting read I would not recommend this book at all.",
            "In short - nothing can go wrong for the Americans, who are brilliant, brave, and good. Nothing can go right for the British, who are stupid, darstadly, and evil. Reading this book you get the impression that the North was so militarily advanced that they would have won the civil war in 6 months... which of course didn't happen. The British on other hand make some incredible blunders. With regards to the southern landing, I could almost believe the bit about mistakenly attacking Confederate positions, and even the rapes, but after that it turned into a farce. The British general decides that he is going to recover from the distaster by marching inland and conquering everyone. Come again??? I'm not sure where Harrison dreamed that one up from... The British are later made to wonder if perhaps that had something to do with the CSA's decision to join the North against the British... of course, they are so arrogant and stupid that they don't think it very likely.Just as ridiculous and childlike in its simplistic convenience was the way that Lincoln and Jackson conveniently patch up all the differences between North and South. Harrison writes as if he imagines that all he would have to do is travel back in time, explain everything to the two sides, and everyone would say &quot;Oh of course! How stupid we are. Let's stop the war and become friends again.&quot; Frankly I think he should compare the way sentiments run in northern Ireland or Israel... does anyone think that a simple explanation would solve all that? Harrison claims that this is how it would really have happened? I was far more impressed by Turtledove's &quot;Guns of the South&quot;... even though it contained a ludicrous timetravel element, it succeeded in being far more convincing and realistic in its characterisations and new timeline.When USA invades Canada, of course they had no thought of expansion of their own territory, and wished only to aid this poor country to gain its independence. Given USA's expansionist mentality both before and after the Civil War, this is rather unlikely. I think in part 2 of this series (may it be long delayed) USA will conquer the world. Harrison already claims without doubt that USA &amp; CSA would have defeated the combined armies of all the European states at the same time...I kept waiting and waiting for something to go wrong for the Americans. I foolishly thought that Harrison might remember the old saying: &quot;no battle plan ever survives contact with the enemy.&quot; Sadly, it was a vain hope. In this world, God is an American, and the dice are heavily loaded in their favour. Watch out you evil British!",
            "Harrison offers a fresh idea on what if the British had intervened in the American Civil War, in this case as a result of the Trent affair. What's new about his take is that due to one mistaken attack, the British end up at war with both the USA *and* CSA. This book is billed as the first of a trilogy, but happily for the read, Harrison has avoided the worst excess of Harry Turtledove, the &quot;master of alternate history&quot;. In other words, Harrison figures out to give each series book an ending, rather than just stop in mid-story.",
            "The book doesn't deserve even the one star that I've given it. What a load of racist, jingoistic, nationalistic America uber ales clap trap !. What an insight into the American mind. I only reached the point in the book where the British troops having conducted themselves like the Americans in Vitenam, by attacking the wrong target and running amock amongst the civilaian population, managed to unite the two waring factions against them. Then British navy had fallen foul of superior America technology and an English traitor turned up to betray his country, because he sooooooooooo admired the American way of life and values, \"America is the only truely free country\" ! when I had to throw up. Faced with a remaining half a novel where clearly America was not going to put a foot wrong, lose a battle and never concede the moral high ground against an enemy who wasn't going to do anything right and conduct him self like a cross between the Mongal hoards and Mel Gibsons view of the English and demonstrate military ineptness at every turn, that I had to give up. How can HH have dragged out another half novel let alone two other books with America in such an obvious state of high moral and military supremacy. I can only image that the rest of the novel and other two books deal with Americas liberation of the world, bringing to the whole of mankind the admirable benefits of consumerism and the market economy. It is only when you (the British) are painted as the villain in such drivel that you can truely see the nationlist (ie fascist) mentality that dominates Americas view of the world. That the book turns on an act of friendly fire (a rather large one admitted) given Americas' callous disregard for their allies and the tendancy of American troops to shoot anything on the field of battle not carrying the stars & stripes (Briish allies, Italian allies), followed by a total lack of any disciplinary action by their commanders is high irony.",
            "I really enjoy Alternate-History novels and Stars and Stripes Forever was great, though I must admit , some parts were a little implausible ex. erorous tactics on the part of the British in the Blockade breaking attack ! However, the novel set the stage for more great books and was by far the most enjoyable novel I have read from Harry Harrison, it moved along at a furious pace and really captivates the reader till the end while leaving more events to take place in the future.",
            "I won't go into a lot of detail, just say...yechhh. The characters are wooden, the dialogue stilted, and his research is sloppy. I might buy the next two volumes (but not in hardcover!); the novel was interesting in a traffic-accident sort of way.",
            "Okay. Harrison have some facts wrong and the American are truely hero's. So far I agree with some of the other reviews. BUT I liked the book very much. It's interesting and it have a cartain drive. I dont regret buying it and I will buy the next one as well.",
            "When you're writing an alternate-history story, the correct thing to do is to set up your point of divergence and then let events develop naturally from there so that you and your readers can see at least one way things might otherwise have turned out. Harry Harrison does just the opposite in his \"Stars and Stripes Forever\" trilogy; he's set up a desired outcome and turned just about everything after his POD (the British go to war with the United States over the _Trent_ affair - to be fair, as another reviewer has noted, that part is well done) to achieve that desired end.That's the root cause, to use a much-overused nonce phrase, of everything that's wrong with these three books. Harrison goes wrong as soon as he has the British fire on the Confederate town of Biloxi, Mississippi, in a friendly-fire incident as they try to find the Union forces they're supposed to attack. Actually, that's plausible enough, but what happens immediately thereafter is NOT plausible (especially if you consider the fact that we're talking about the British army, one of the best-disciplined in the world at any time in the last couple of centuries) and the absurdities just begin to pile up from there. As I said, Harrison has a predetermined objective in mind and he'll get there, come hell, high water, or counterfactual believability. The only real value these books have is as a sterling example of how NOT to write an alternate-history epic.",
            "I suggest next time, that Harrisson sees the war plans for a conflict before he actually puts pen to paper.The British are portrayed as evil morons, doomed to defeat.The Americans advance in technology 10 years overnight, while wishing all their problems of Civil War and bad leadership.They can do no wrong.The Canadians welcome the US as liberators, (unlikely, they would have resisted).This book was simply Anglophobic wish fulfillment, and bears no resemblance to what would of happened, British war plans were defensive in Canada, the army was not strong enough to attack.And the RN would have gutted the USN and US seaboard, while destroying US trade.You just can't make it all up, or you may as well give the US forces aircraft, lasers and Nuclear weapons next, then say &quot;but if.......&quot;Its obvious that the next books in this series will be worse.I am disappointed with this work, his &quot;West of Eden&quot; series was fun.And I'm surprised that so many US readers fell for it all.Turtledove is far far far far better.",
            "This novel is a turkey.Though I find it very plausable that the arrogance of Britain would cause the British to declare war on the United States after the forced removal of two southerners from a British ship (Chesapeak vs Leopard in reverse). And I do see the chance of a minor border incident leading to conflic. Just as I am extremely impressed by the Authjor's description of HMS Warrior. And certainly, the North would have clobbered any British invasion by shere weight of numbers, and then invaded Canada.However, I honestly doubt that the South would join arms with the North after a little friendly fire incident. The Southern elite having gone to such efforts to bring Britian and France into their side of the war.Would Washington have joined forces with Clinton if the French ahd accidentally attacked him?Would Eisenhower join arms witht the Germans if the Soviets had attacked him under similar circumstances?No where in history has such an in conflict change of sides taken place.This story defies both history and human nature, if it were to happen for real.And where is France? Britain's ally.Napoleon III had eyes on Mexico.I can write a better novel than this.",
            "This alternate history starts off great with the British war party urging an attack on the United States. Get in there, give the damn colonials what for, says the reader. Sure enough the commander goes over there and attacks the wrong side. I have absolutely no problem with this. There was far worse stupidity and incompetence in the real-life Crimean War a mere 10 years before. There follows a hugely enjoyable scene of mindless slaughter and rape (you don't get many decent rape stories these days) and then the novel falls to pieces. The syrupy sentimentality that seems to afflict all Americans kicks in. The Northern and Southern commanders get together to drive out the dastardly Brits and become the best of buddies and the southereners volunteer to abandon slavery. From then on nothing can go wrong for the Americans and they defeat the British at every turn. What utter bollocks. The two sides would never have been able to sink their differences to that extent and the high command's main concern would have been to keep them from one another's throats. In the Crimea the British and French were more interested in fighting each other than the enemy. In the novel that should have been written we would have seen all this. Slavery wasn't an issue anyway. Lincoln was quite prepared to tolerate it if that would preserve the Union. The trouble is that Harrison is such a good writer. I suspect he popped his clogs afater the Biloxi incident and the book was finished by someone not nearly as good. I have no objection to the two-dimensional nature of the characters. As we never get to know and love them, we can enjoy the senseless massacres that bespatter nearly every page. Neither do I have any problem with the way Queen Victoria is portrayed. The mad old bat was exactly like that. &quot;Butty&quot; for comrade is perfectly good 19th century usage: you work buttock to buttock in the mines. &quot;Buddy&quot; is a later variation.",
            "All fiction, particularly Science Fiction and Fantasy (which are Mr. Harrison's forte') rely on the \"suspension of disbelief\" - the changing of some aspect of what we accept as reality to form the basic premise upon which the story will be built. This works if the changes don't depart too far from what we'll accept as believable - hence the term \"suspension of disbelief\". In this case, are we willing to believe (for the sake of the story) that Prince Albert of England died sooner than history says he really did? The answer here would have been yes.So, if Mr. Harrison had stopped there, and built a story based purely on that one premise, a really good novel could have resulted. However, the possibility that \"suspension of disbelief\" can be achieved declines as more and more changes have to be accepted by the reader to make the story believable to themselves as they read it.Although I am a big Harrison fan, I think the author forgot that most basic of all rules when writing this novel: there are too many changes that have to be accepted - the British being more incompetent and vindictive than we'd expect, improbable battlefield events and shuffling of alliances, new warfare technologies being adopted sooner and/or much more rapidly than they really were. Even someone who is not a student of the Civil War will find much of this book to be hard to accept.It's just too much: the storyline becomes less and less believable the farther you go into the book. The rest of the trilogy follows in this vein, with hard-to-believe developments piling on top of other not-quite-so-hard-to-believe developments inStars and Stripes in Peril (Stars & Stripes Trilogy)to reach a completely improbable conclusion inStars and Stripes Triumphant (Stars & Stripes Trilogy).I could talk a bit, as others have done here, about weak character development in a few cases, and hard to follow plotlines - but, in reality, although not outstanding in these areas, I did not find these issues as troubling as others seem to have.Despite my reservations, I did read all three novels in this trilogy, largely because they are at least as good as the average in this genre', which - if nothing else, is a testament to Harry Harrison's skill as a writer and the esteem in which I hold most of his work, despite the fatal errors he made early on in this book and the subsequent volumes.So, can I recommend any novel in this trilogy to the casual reader, looking for an light and entertaining read some weekend? Unfortunately, No...I can, however, give it a limited recommendation, as I think it works to some extent, despite the flaws, especially for those who like to dwell (as I do) upon the \"what if's\" of history: Mr. Harrison raises some interesting points which are thought provoking, and Civil War fans will find enough military hardware, historical personalities and battle scenes to keep themselves happy.So, overall, I'll give it Two Stars: a so-so effort, but with enough interesting points and good enough writing to keep it from totally missing the target.",
            "An excellent alternate-history book. What else would one expect from Mr. Harrison? The master of the genre proves himself yet again. The book tells a tale of the war between the states as it would have been if England had intervened on the Confiderate side. The story is very historically correct, and even the fiction part stays amazingly close to facts. The book does get a little too-romanticized towards the end - the Union army performs wonders even though they are in a very bad position. One thing I do not like is that the English are shown to be rather clumsy and stupid. Still, it is an excellent book - I swallowed it in a weekend.",
            "I have to admit that I enjoyed reading this book. Another reviewer accuses Harrison of wish fulfillment and I have to agree, but I sympathize with the wish, so I enjoyed the ride. That's what's good about the book and gets it both stars.My next wish would be that he didn't have to resort to so many divergent points to make his outcome seem plausible. In his interview in the back of the book, he states &quot;Prince Albert's death occurs just a few weeks earlier in time. Then we watch the ripples spread out from this change: how one after another, events are altered, small changes growing into larger ones until there is a new history that is just as realistic as the one in the history books.&quot; I will grant him that I don't find this version completely unrealistic. No single event in the book is completely implausible. (Some history buffs may disagree with me and I can only claim laymen's ignorance.) However, to call the alterations he makes &quot;ripple effects&quot; as a pretty far stretch. How on earth did the premature death of Prince Albert lead to the changes in Union personnel the author suggests? (One is out of commission by falling on railroad tracks!) While I find it plausible that the British action in the South might be enough to focus the attention of both on a common foe. The British action itself, however, I am asked to not only find plausible, but somehow likely given the state of war between the Union and the British. Ripple effect? More like throwing a handful of pebbles (and one outrageous rock) in a pond. And this, after criticizing the &quot;killer asteroid strike&quot; as &quot;Showy perhaps, but very easy to write.&quot; (Was that a dig on Turtledove's World War series?)The laymen in me enjoyed the book, but I like to feel like I've learned something real about history by reading alternate history. So, I am also disappointed to read so many reviews that point out historical implausibilities and factual errors. As a non-expert, I am relying on the author to be an expert.In summary, it is a nice smooth ride for jingoists like myself, but too full of flaws to recommend. I will probably read a sequel, if there is one, and hope that he uses the ending point as a single starting point this time and doesn't just keep throwing in random disruptions in the space-time continuum.",
            "I have been a big fan of the alternate history genre for years, and this probably comes from the fact that I love history and have the kind of mind that always asks &quot;what if?&quot; The premise of this book is an excellent and plausible one - Britain and the United States going to war in 1862 following the &quot;Trent Affair&quot;. However, as I read along in the book I was disappointed by how improbable some of the twists and turns in thestory are.- Would the British have dared to mount an invasion of the US from Canada when they had only a few thousand troops whereas the US could send tens of thousands and still have plenty to face the Confederates (even if they had to go on the defensive vs. the CSA)?- If the British had accidentally attacked a Confederate fort and gone on to sack the town nearby, wouln't they have tried to patch up relations with the CSA who were, after all, their allies. Even if they were overly confident, it is extremely improbable that they would have just thrown up their hands &amp; said &quot;what the heck, we'll just go to war against the CSA too!&quot;- The USA and CSA would not have been able to resolve their differences so quickly, even if they were up against a common enemy. This is the most improbable point in the book. Having a common enemy does not necessarily make nations (or people) friendly toward each other. Also, the Confederacy agreeing to give up slavery so readily - not likely! Harris seems to think that all the US needed to solve its sectional and racial hostilities was a good foreign enemy for everyone to fight! Its never been that easy.- Even if US ironclads like Monitor had better armor and could beat anything in the Royal Navy, the Union only had 1 or 2 of them at the time (same for the CSA and its ironclads). Furthermore, these ironclads could only operate in coastal waters. In any deep water, the US had only wooden ships which were greatly outnumbered &amp; outgunned by the British. The US got a couple of deep ocean ironclads by the end of the Civil War, but that would take quite a while to build and by the time they were finished the British could have built better oceangoing ironclads to match the US.- Would French/Quebecois in Canada rise up in favor of an invading US army? They didn't much care for the British but they hadn't shown any interest in supporting the US cause in the American Revolution or War of 1812, so why would it suddenly be different? The English speaking Canadians would certainly have been against the US, considering that many of them were descended from Loyalists in the American Revolution who had all their property in the US confiscated for supporting the British cause.I don't think that the author is anti-British in the sense of being against the whole British people, but he definitely has a hstrong hostility to the elite aristocracy. He portrays them almost universally as extremely arrogant, overconfident, anti-American, and completely ignorant of the technological changes going on in warfare. No doubt there were quite a few who matched the above description (all you have to do is read a little about the Crimean War!), but not every officer/gentleman in the British army was a pompous, drooling moron. The USA and CSA had their share of officers who were ignorant and owed their commission to social background &amp; political influence too. In short, the premise is fascinating and certain parts but the direction the story takes is too improbable and too slanted against the British to make this a really good work of alternate history.",
            "I enjoyed everything else I have read from Harry Harrison, and am fascinated by alternative history, so I expected to like this book. I didn't.I think it does credit to the American reviewers who have criticised this book that it went down nearly as badly with them as it did with Brits. They have demonstrated that one comment by a British reviewer - that this book provides an insight into the American mind - is unfair to most Americans.The starting premise - Britain blundering into war with the North in the American civil war - is horrifying plausible, which is not surprising as this very nearly happened. The first part of the book, up to that stage, is well done.However, the author then abandons any attempt at either a realistic attempt to work through what might have happened, or to look sympathically at how the situation might have developed from the viewpoint of all sides. Instead, looking for a way to turn both the USA and CSA into heroes, he casts the Brits as utterly incompetent and evil cretins who both sides can unite against.Although it isn't a positive for me to read a book in which my country is shown in a bad light, this doesn't usually make it impossible for me to enjoy a work of fiction. Heaven only knows Britain has had it's share of reverses and like every other country in the world has been responsible for some stupid or wicked mistakes. However, the increasingly implausible idiocy through which this book has the British blundering into war against both parties in the American civil war is way over the top. The idea that a Commander in Chief of any civilised nation could simultaneously be moronic enough to commit the acts attributed to the Duke of Cambridge in this book, and clever enough to prevent his own government finding out what he had done and sacking him, is ludicrous beyond belief.Harry Harrison is almost the last writer on earth I would have expected to prostitute his enormous talents with such chauvinistic rubbish. One-sided nationalism is not usually his style at all, and he has written another book about a set of events which might have changed the course of the US Civil War/War between the States - \"Rebel in Time\" - which is far superior to this.The market for this book is people who like America, hate the British, and are not too bothered about historical plausibility. So it may sell some copies in the USA, and probably a few in Ireland (though as I'm married to an Irish catholic girl I think I'm qualified to say that not everyone in Ireland falls into these categories.) In the rest of the world most of those who don't like the Brits don't like the USA either, and would be even less sympathetic to the CSA.For anyone who is looking for a good account of how the American Civil war might have gone wrong, try Harry Turtledove's \"The Guns of the South,\" or \"How Few Remain\" and the \"Great War\" and \"American Empire\" trilogies which follow it. Or indeed Harry Harrison's \"Rebel in Time\".",
            "Harry Harrison's alternate history novel &quot;Stars &amp; Stripes Forever&quot; begins by contending that following the removal of two Confederate commissioners from the British steam packet Trent in November 1861, war between the United States and Great Britain over the incident was averted because Prince Albert, the consort of Queen Victoria, toned down the language of the dispatch sent to the American government. By having Prince Albert stricken by his terminal illness a little bit earlier, Harrison sets the two nations on the path to war. However, this one slight alteration is not enough for Harrison. He is not alone in pointing out that the Civil War was the first &quot;modern&quot; war, and can point to numerous military advantages invented during that time (ships built of iron, breech loading cannons, observation balloons, etc.) to support his claim. Ultimately, Harrison wants to show the Americans taking full advantage of all such new technology to wage full out war against the British. For this reason Harrison manipulates events a bit further (e.g., the general who delayed mass production of the Sharps rifle conveniently dies) to ensure the American army and navy are truly formidable entities.All this is well and good, and certainly great fun when it comes to &quot;what if&quot; speculations, something I have always enjoyed ever since SNL did their &quot;What if Napoleon had a B-52 at the Battle of Waterloo&quot; skit. But where Harrison goes a bit too far is the little twist of fate he comes up with to reunite the North and South. Things progress to the point where the British invade New York from Canada and launch another attack on the Gulf Coast. However, the British confuse Biloxi Mississippi with Mobile Bay, mistake the Stars &amp; Bars for the Stars &amp; Stripes, and end up attacking the Confederates instead. But that is not enough for Harrison, who then has the British troops get drunk and start... all the women. Because of this outrage General Beauregard asks for an armistice with General Sherman (Grant has gone with most of the Army of Tennessee to repel the British Invasion from the North), who decides to send a Federal regiment with the Confederates to avenge Biloxi. This becomes the catalyst for reunion, along with a lesson in economics from John Stuart Mill and other interesting events.By this point we have certainly gone far a field from Harrison's initial premise. The political reunification of the country is even more fanciful than the military maneuvers, which at least have the charm of being grounded in the technology of the time. His characterization of the political and military figures of the time do not ring especially true (I never got used to Lincoln and Davis calling each other Abraham and Jefferson, or Lee calling Sherman &quot;Cump&quot;), the British are a collection of egotistical idiots, and in the end you get the feeling that this would have worked better as an essay rather than a novel. All the salient points could be sketched out just fine without needing to be presented in narrative form. This story continues in &quot;Stars &amp; Stripes in Peril&quot; where General Lee proposes to free Ireland to get the British to stop trying to invade the United States, which has the same strengths and weaknesses as this volume. A provocative ideal, but not a compelling novel.",
            "I wish this rating system had a lower ranking then one star because even this suggests a book is partially acceptable when this book would not even make a good doorstop.This is probably the worst book, let alone novel, that I have ever read. It is stilted formula writing geared for jingoistic morons who know or care nothing about history. Given the fact that it is supposed to be &quot;alternate history&quot; the only similarity to actual historical events are the names. All the Americans are demigods the British fools and you wonder how these same Brits could have won and maintained the largest empire ever seen. Harrison would have us believe that Queen Victoria was a frumpy old drunk and that the English people lived in downright slavery under their aristocratic lords. That John Mills was a traitor and after one bloody battle both the North and South are willing to settle their differences where in reality they were to suffer ten times as many casualties and fight for three more years until the South finally quit. The Royal navy attacks the Union without the foresight of having attached Confederate officers that can distinguish between the Stars and Stripes and Stars and Bars. Then Mr Harrison has the audacity to say : this &quot;could be a true story&quot; and yes pigs might fly. The only thing that I can consider worse than this book is that there might be two more. Come on you environment lovers stop these books and save some trees. Mr Harrison stick to space where you can delve into fantasy to your heart's content. Readers,if you want real alternate history read Harry Turtledove skip this turkey.",
            "I am a 36 year old reader from England, who has had an interest in the Civil War period for most of that time. More recently, particularly in the wake of Ken Burns' excellent series, I had become affected by the vast scale of this tragedy and, after a visit to Civil War sites, by the strong feelings which remain in the USA about this unprecedented war. The author is evidently an expert on the Civil War, and I'm sure he must have felt the same way and for much longer. I think this is why he came around to thinking how much better it would be to transfer all the grief of a civil strife onto a likely external aggressor: England! I have to say that I am not convinced that there really would have been such a war, and Harrison is absolutely wrong when he suggests that there would have been popular support for one here: feelings against slavery were running high and, as British author Paul Johnson recently pointed out in his 'History of the American People' President Licoln wa! ! s greatly moved by letter from impoverished Lancashire cotton workers, backing his cause against pro-southern voices in England. But that is real history, and Harrison prefers to have great fun with his 'what if' scenario: what if the 'Trent' incident had led to an immediate war? Actually he cannot resist the tempation to go much further and have England, the imperialist aggressor, act as a kind of lightening rod for all the true horrors of the Civil War: here, there are no prison 'death' camps, no massacres of black Union soldiers. Nor are any incompetent Union generals in charge (Sherman takes over immedeately: McClellan is indisposed). Better still, the British Navy make a frightfully useful strategic error of navigation which ends up uniting North and South against them: so now the 'good' generals like Lee and Grant are prevented from having to feed thousands of their countrymenmen into terrible 'meat grinder' battles against their own countrymen like Antietam, Gettysburg ! ! and Spotsylvania Court House. Instead, they revive their pr! e-war friendships and get stuck into their (irredeemably callous) foreign enemy, who is not averse to rape and pillage in order to gain the objective (and that is something which isn't really clear..). These British are uniformly terrible: they are lead by a permanently hysterical Queen Victoria, her callous cousin, HRH the Duke of Cambridge, and the gout-ridden war-hawk Prime Minister, Lord Palmerston. The British army has a particular hatred of foreigners including French Canadians (who rebel) and Irish American soldiers (whom they massacre). They also rape southern women, and joyfully conduct unprovoked attacks on civilians and their property. After their inevitable defeat, we hear that the better ones (and all the Irish ones) decide to stay on in America. If youre suffering a glut of all those plummy types in 'Masterpiece Theatre', this could be your antidote! Of course this is 2 dimensional twaddle, but Harrison is very god at driving his narrative forward. Sometimes his ! ! dialogue looks as if he has just inserted quotation marks around a book of Civil War facts (perhaps he has) but occasionally he does write racy prose and, particularly in the accounts of sea battles, both fictional and factual, he writes it excitingly and convincingly. For all his knowledge, Harrison has put in some terrible howlers. There were no Feninans in 1842: that movement wasn't formed until 1858 (in USA). Lord Palmerston's government in 1862 was not a Tory one. Queen Victoria had no 'castles' in London (however draughty). And as a resident and avid reader of the history of my country, I have never come across any accounts of an English annexation of Cornwall, our westernmost county ('Cornish nationalists', driven to extremes of rhetoric by the antics of summer holidaymakers in their balmy outreach may say otherwise...) At the end of the book, Harrson tells us that it is all true which, of course, it isn't. At this point I really began to wonder whether this might not j! ! ust be a bit of fun, and that he really is just a little bi! t, well, Anglophobe! Should we be getting worried on this side of the pond? Interestingly, Harrison keeps the Duke of Wellington alive into 1862 (he died in 1852): is the Iron Duke to be our instrument by which we will be able to avenge ourselves over you 'colonial' wretches? We will all have to await the second part of the trilogy to find out, although I for one will probaly be borrowing it from the library, prior to some idle hours on a beach -in Cornwall!",
            "To avoid paying this tax, resist buying this turkey of a book and donate the money to a deserving charity instead.Alternatively buy it and treat it as a pot-boiling, dashed-off-by-dictation-in-a-weekend exercise in satire directed at the alt.hist fiction genre.",
            "Mr. Harrison embarrasses himself with the constant stream of inaccuracies he portrays in the story, with very little prior to the timeline shift being close to the way things really happened. The two Confederate commissioners did everything they could to get caught, and still almost failed at that task. They had deliberately wanted to provoke an incident, so they made their itinerary publicly known and even delayed their trip a couple of times to make sure a USN ship would attempt to capture them. The British government did not want to go to war against either American &quot;country&quot;, as they were trading with both. Mr. Harrison also forgot to mention the fact that the Confederacy had, of its own accord, deliberately shut off the supply of its cotton, to force the Europeans to acknowledge their status as an independent nation. The &quot;Northern blockade&quot;, especially in late 1861, was more of a joke than a reality. Another &quot;fact&quot; that really puzzled me was when Lincoln was reading some of his &quot;State of the Union&quot; address to Attorney General Bates, Bates mentioned &quot;the draft rioting among the Irish immigrants in New York...&quot;, which did not take place until the middle of 1863! These historical errors I mentioned were found after only reading 45 pages of the paperback copy. If the other reviews are anything to go by, these errors will continue to compound, until my suspension of disbelief will be impossible to maintain. I heartily recommend to Mr. Harrison that he stick to writing stories that are more thoroughly researched and executed, instead of this incredible travesty, which is far below his abilities.",
            "Leaving aside the excessively period prose, leaving aside the utter predictablility of everything (except the Trent affair), leaving aside even the impossible perfidy and incompetance of the British (let me see, just how was it they ended up ruling 1/4 of the world?), this book is simply poorly researched. And, to any Civil War buff, the research is off in the most appalling ways imaginable. Simple things...how many rounds in a Spencer (7 not 20). In a Sharps (1...I repeat, 1). What was Meagher's rank in 1862 (he was not a captain)...a general (Sherman) in command of an army takes a mere regiment with him to battle (hmmm, was it a battle?) the Brits. Bah! This was such a waste of money I may never buy a Harrison book again.But wait...No, Harrison isn't a bad writer. This is impossible. Ah, I know. He wrote it as satire on the other alternate history book available on the subject. Yes, that MUST be it because NO ONE is this bad a writer. It's satire, great satire. I take back everything I said.",
            "A biased and ludicrous tale written with the sophistication of a 10 year old. In this book it is shown clearly that the only battle plan that survives contact with the enemy is an American one. Nothing can go wrong for them, and nothing can go right for the darstadly British.The British are all incompetent and moronic, and make decisions totally devoid of logic. Especially grating was the way a British general who lands in the south decides to march inland to conquer everybody... North and South. His modest force assigned for a coastal assault is subsuequently destroyed. No kidding!The other ridiculous thing was the way in which North and South conveniently solve all their problems in one conversation. Harrison evidently believes that the participants just needed to have everything explained clearly to them, and they would of course see the light. This lacks any credibility, and shows a rather immature grasp of the emotions involved. Perhaps Harrison would like to try his method in Israel or Northern Ireland, and see how far he gets.Each chapter made me cringe anew, as I wondered what next could happen to bring glory to the saintly Americans and downfall to the wicked British. Alas, I kept hoping the British would get one lucky break, but it never happened. Canada is &quot;liberated&quot; though of course USA never considers actually keeping it! They are just helping a fellow state... yeah right. America was still in a thoroughly expansionist frame of mind, and would have happily added Canada to their list of possessions.If any reader wants a truly engrossing alternative version of the civil war, I'd suggest Turtledove's &quot;Guns of the South&quot;. Despite a completely ridiculous timetravel element, it manages to convey an air of realism and truth that Harrison never comes close to matching.",
            "Harry Harrison starts out with a interesting idea. What if Prince Albert was dead when a U.S. warship stopped a British ship and seized two Confederate emissaries on their way to England? In our history Prince Albert was able to defuse the crisis. But what if Queen Victoria responded like the rest of England with outrage and declared war on the U.S. of A?Things become A LOT more interesting. Soon Lincoln and the North finds itself fighting both the South and an English invasion from Canada. That, in itself would of made for an interesting novel.But Harrison can't let it go at that. Right when you think the North might lose with too many fronts to fight on the British Navy invades the WRONG city. Instead of saying, &quot;OOps, sorry, you Yanks all look alike.&quot; it decides to continue to fight BOTH sides. Of course, the North and the South join up together and the tide turns again.BESIDES the fact that I don't picture the British Navy landing troops on the wrong coast, I don't believe that either the British navy nor the British army would be so easy to defeat. I also don't see the British officers as being so stupid. True, it would of been a costly battle for the British, with the USA and CSA having more local ironclades to defend their coast, more Americans would of joined the army on both sides and the defenders would have shorter supply lines, but still it would not have been so easy.I'm not saying the Americans would not win, bit it would of taken longer and frankly, I still don't think the British would of attacked the South by accident. They HAVE maps.Also the book shows British troops as looters and murders. Which they were, but they were also DAMN tough fighters!",

            "The research that went into this series of books was very poor. The weapons, geography, historical figures, and units were completely misrepresented. There was no sense of time in the story, either. A ship or unit would cover hundreds of miles in a day or two just to fill in a plot point. This might be a minor point for others, but it was a major sticking point for me. A glaring example of this is the casualties reported at the Battle of Shiloh. 22,000 casualties is a world apart from 22,000 dead. If you are going to write about something, you had better do your research or you will look like an imbecile. The writing itself was dreadful, too. Save your time, read something, anything, else.",
            "I have a LOT of Harry Harrison's Stainless Steel Rat series, but I had not heard of this novel. It's absolutely wonderful! If you enjoyed \"Killer Angels\", you'll like this book. I had read Harrision's alternate history \"A Transatlantic Tunnel, Hurrah!\", but didn't know he'd done a civil war trilogy. I highly recommend this book if you like historical fiction and/or alternate realities.",
            "In \"Stars and stripes Forever\" Harry Harrison has created an intriguing plot line. The Trent Affair escalates into British recognition of the Confederacy. Ironically the British sack a Confederate city on the Gulf of Mexico. Soon a united American military counterattacks into Canada and the Caribbean. It is perhaps somewhat unrealistic that the British would turn so decisvely against a powerful ally without even trying to avoid widening the conflict. But this is alternative history and sometimes giving the author leeway is okay. Odd things happen after all.First the good points. The book can be a fast read and the writing, while not exceptional, is reasonably good. The British characters often come across as pompous idiots. That actually makes them more entertaining in a certain warped sterotypical way. Whether that is completely realistic though may be more debateable. The British afterall became the largest empire the world had ever seen; hardly a task for utterly bumbling leaders. The novel features numerous battles on land and sea ranging from set piece attacks to seiges to ironclad duels. A more descriptive writer may have fleshed these out better but the descriptions were adequate. The story also features some interesting parallels with events in the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812.Now some of the negatives. Once the Union and Confederates unite, the British are utterly overwhelmed. Their ironclads are outnumbered, their supply lines are stretched, and their military is both outnumbered and outclassed. Make no mistake the British prove a tough opponent but it really seems that all they ultimately have left is to keep a stiff upper lip until the Americans clobber them. Perhaps even more odd was the role of John Stuart Mill trying to arbitrate between North and South. He sweeps in like a prophet and swiftly gathers Lincoln under his wings (okay perhaps some exageration there but not that much). More unrealistically is how swift the Confederates are willing to listen to Mill. Let me get this right. An Englishman (nonreligious?) proposes abolishing slavery and industrializing the South and actually attracts a lot of southern leadership support. The south was a largely rural society willing to fight to preserve the old order including slavery. I understand that an English invasion could make strange political bedfellows but I have a hard time seeing Jefferson Davis yielding to an Englishman telling him to give up slavery and industrialize. Another issue is that Harrison focuses on major historical characters such as Sherman, Lee, Lincoln, Palmerston, etc. This is okay so far as it goes but lower ranking characters typically get less development. More balance may have helped flesh out the story.Overall an interesting and very readle alternative history novel. Not a masterpiece but worth a look.",
            "Stars and Stripes Forever delivers poorly the interesting concept of Britian invades North America during the War for Southern Independence.I'm no true expert on the war, but there were several errors, especially relating to Jefferson Davis. Davis was not a soldier thrust into politics, but rather an experienced politician in the US Congress and Mississippi legislature. He was not expecting to be appointed president of the Confederacy, but rather a command. Also, Davis favored an eventual emanicipation of slaves.The characters in this book were all rather dull, and uninspired. Lee was not the commander in chief of the Confederate Army.The British all seem violent and evil, not one speaks against the American Expedition.And, I don't think the Confederacy would be willing to fold so quickly, unless Lincoln made many concessions, something more than appointing Judah Benjamin as Secretary of the Southern States. Which reminds me, should the Confederate president become disabled, the vice president assumes the Presidency, not an appointee.The biggest thing that stuck me was all the misspellings, and especially, the sentence fragments on all fronts.Turtledove is the one you should read.",
            "This book was fun to read.But portraying the british army as rapists and thugs was out of order.And as for one brit soldier killing one of his own ncos because he tried to stop a rape what crud. The limeys are a funny bunch and the odd case of rape etc would happen in any army of that time.But as an American who has served along side the British Army their discipline now as then is rigid to say the least.",
            "I agree with Ken from Louisville; this book starts off with an interesting and tinglingly plausible premise (which he proceeds to spindle and mutilate in his treatment of it), and basically goes downhill from there. A good half of the work is essentially wasted in an overly-long buildup to the &quot;turning point.&quot; Therafter, the plot is at best thin. Harrison also threw in a few errata (the Spencer repeating rifle does NOT, as stated, hold 20 rounds, and a 400-pounder Parrot naval gun never existed)and at times either exaggerates or minimizes the importance of various factors. Some events are so outlandishly unlikely as to spoil the genius behind them. The conclusion was extremely rocky, as if he was desperate to bring the book to a conclusion while simultaneously leaving it open for a sequel. I was honestly disappointed in this book, because I truly enjoyed many of this author's other works. All in all, I'd say read it if you have the time, but don't get your hopes up.",
            "I thought the book was great, an alternate ending to what was America's most decisive chapter. What I liked was how the combined strength of the two armies proved what odds they could accomplish together and not apart. America's invasion of Canada, was also great, with the Rebels showing why they were a force to be reckoned with. Imagine if this had really happened. No Gettysburg No Andersonville, a peaceful end to slavery. And worst of all. Lincoln not getting assassinated.",
            "This book started off with a great premise of what would happen if a small event such as Prince Albert not being able to tone down the British ultimatum to the Lincoln government over the Trent Affair resulted in Britain declaring war on the U.S. However, a great premise does not necessarily a great book make. The historical characters all seemed quite wooden, and many did things completely out of character. The British are made out to be completely incompetent (the same British who were lords over a fifth of the Earth, by the way). Also dissappointing was the way the book went completely beyond belief. One example is the ease of how the North and South forgets the bloodshed of 1861 and 1862 to unite against Britain. If you want an excellent book about alternate civil war history, read &quot;Guns of the South&quot;, &quot;How Few Remain&quot;, or &quot;Gray Victory&quot;. These are much better than this sub-standard work by Harry Harrison. Harrison would be well advised to stick to fantasy and leave the realm of alternate history to the master, Harry Turtledove.",
            "I can believe the premise of England becoming involved in the ACW over the Trent affair. I can even believe the Uion Armies being able to defeat the Engish because they are battle tested and adapting to the new tactic while the British have not. What I can't believe is the mistaken attack on Biloxi MS and and the simplistic answer to the slavery question. To me it shows a complete lack in understnding the whole issue by the author. The next problem I have with the book is the dialoge. It is atrocious. Nobody uses any kinds of contractions and very little slang. The typos are horrible. At one point a common soilder to lamenting on all his friends killed and he thinks about &quot;all his Butties&quot; I am just glad I got this book from the library and didn't have to pay for it. However, I will probably read the next 2 books to see if they get any better.",
            "I have read and enjoyed most Harry Harrison books, but this one came to me so full of grammatical errors and horrid misspellings that I must conclude that the day of the proofreader is done. There is too much philosophizing and a rather overdone glorification of William Tecumseh Sherman, as well as more than enough of Grant's drinking problem. How could Sherman have commanded the respect of Lee (who was not at the time of the story, however historically distorted, &quot;Commander in Chief of the Confederate Army&quot;)? Lee was Commander of the Army of Northern Virginia in 1861, 62, 63. It is easy to believe that we beat the British in less than a year after the &quot;Battle of Biloxi,&quot; but distortions of history are little use unless preceded by true history. Irishness must be catching!",
            "Harry Harrison starts out with a promising premise but it quickly falls apart in an ever growing string of preposterous events. For any student of history or fan of alternate history that is intrigued by the possibilities that may have been brought about to history by the altering of one or two events this is not the book for you. The author makes great leaps of faith in most of his assumptions (leaping over any type of logic most of the time) about what would have happened if Britain would have entered the Civil War. The image of Confederate General J.E.B. Stuart riding into New York to save the Union army of U.S. Grant from the evil invading British ravaging hordes brandishing Spencer repeating rifles just boggles the mind. Overall a book better left to those who enjoy pure fantasy.",
            "This book shows how the American Civil War could have evolved differently if Great Britain (at the time the world's superpower) would have become involved. It vividly describes scenes of war and politics. Once you read, it is hard to put it down. It might be - as I read in another review - a bit Anglophobe, but given the colonial record of Britain I think it is not 'over the top'.",
            "This is a blatant piece of &quot;brit bashing&quot;.Although Harrison lives somewhere in the British isles, he seems to have picked up a bad dose of pro US jingoism and hatred of the English people, their Government, monarch and History.The dialogue is awful, and there are no main characters to follow, they all seem to die.He claims that this is a true story, but it is not.None of the Britsh actions make any sense......Where do all the troops for the invasion(s) come from? Why do they invade at all, when the British commader in canada is on record as saying that he thought Canada was too weakly garrisoned to even defend itself properly?.I can just about accept navigation errors as gross as in the book but why does Buller invade the CSA, instead of apologising, leaving, getting releaved of command etc etc etc?.Why does the RN ignore an apparantly huge US fleet at mobile bay when they were already aware of it?, the USN was the prime target for attack as it was massively outnumbered,outgunned, and far less experienced and trained than the RN.Where are the British ironclad steam batteries designed for inshore work?, one was already in the Americas, where are the rest?In fact where has rest of the massive RN disappeared too?, thin air? the bermuda triangle perhaps?when the RN battles the Monitor, the rest of the RN seems to have gone away and lost its engines.Why were'nt US coastal cities razed by the RN, as planned, such as New York and Boston, the prime first targets?Why are the British so uniformly incompetent,stupid, arrogant,evil?, and why are they constantly vilified as rapists, cowards and drunkards without skill discipline, intelligence, honour or any other good points?They sound like stuck records endlessly bleating about the USA humiliating them.The Canadians are portrayed as oppressed serfs, awaiting US liberation (these are the same proud Canadians who resented and distrusted the USA, due to the war of 1812 and who fought hard to defend their own flag and King in numerous wars?, traitors were in a minority)The Fenians are presented as plucky Irish lovable heroes (these are the forerunners of the pub-bombing murderers of the IRA).The Americans are the worst.They field endless super weapons such as huge fleets of monitors(how, there were only 4 in service by the end of 1862?) and the USS Avenger, a vessel that never existed.They have sharpshooters capable of winning the war on their own.They are super soldiers, just waiting to kill every last Brit, as is the US people as a whole, and how they love it.Every battle is a walkover, even at sea, where the Monitor sinks the Warrior in about 5 min flat.The Americans then finish on a wonderful tirade against the brits on how they would love to slaughter their way into Britain to execute the Monarchy and Parliament.Perhaps this is to be followed by the rest of the population of England? thats the impression I get.This book left a very bad taste in my mouth, it exulted in the killing of the &quot;evil english&quot;.The next 2 books offer more of the same.Perhaps in the last one we treated to see Queen Victoria and The British Prime Minister hung on the grounds of Buckingham palace, described in graphic loving detail.",
            "Harry Harrison establishes an intriguing premise in &quot;Stars And Stripes Forever&quot;, yet isn't nearly as successful as Harry Turtledove in its execution. The problems are the length of the story and its characters. I found this too quick a read, and none of the characters, especially the historical ones, are truly memorable. Instead, Harrison has chapters that are actually vignettes, as one improbable scene after another unfolds. Fortunately, he gets a bit better in the sequel, &quot;Stars And Stripes In Peril&quot;, but those who are looking for another substantial effort akin to Harry Turtledove's may be in for a major disappointment.",
            "When reading some of the reviews of this book by some I am struck at how critical they are of it. They go on as if they do this for a living and could support themself. For example A.E.Brain writing about how when Britian attacked the south by mistake on Mississippi was a mistake (I asume you know what the state flag of Mississippi looks like). NO well it is Red,White,and Blue Stripes and in the dark with filed glasses could be mistaken at night as the US Flag. And the fact at that time the &quot;Brits&quot; feelings about the US, They only supported the south to hurt the whole of the country so yes they would then continue the attack Because of the fellings in England about the defeats of the war of 1812. And as for the attack on the Black Prince her armor was thiner than the Virginias, and as for the reconciliation Lincoln gave the south the out it wanted because the war was not about slavery but STATES RIGHTS. And there right to rule themself,Lincoln had some plans along those lines but was not able to bring them to fruitation because of the congress at that time and the abolitionist element. So when faced with this war reconciliation would have happened.While I agree it is fiction, alot of the element if it had happen is still fiction thus not try but remember These were brothers and cousins, and remeber the enemey of my enemey is my enemey. They attacked and killed americans so america as a whole will strike back. I have family and we fight but if you attack my family I will attack back with them. So it stands to reason alot of this could have happen if the book had been true. But remember it is an Alternate history book so at the end of the day when the story is over it is still FICTION. And can only be reflected and writen by a person living 100years after the fact, With only speculation to rely on. So for all persons who have been very critical of this book and the story I await you book in the book store on the same topic.",
            "What Harrison says in his Afterword is true: the American armies in 1862 were by far the most powerful fighting force in the world; military observers from all major countries were on hand to learn what modern war was turning into. And, of course the British were arrogant imperialists in those days -- ask the Irish and those living in India and China. (Remember the Opium Wars, fought to enforce the British right to sell opium to the Chinese people?)When the British attack the USA from Canada and then mistakenly attack the Southern city of Biloxi from the sea, thinking it is the Northern outpost on Deer Island, the exhausted British soldiers break discipline after finding a warehouse of liquor, and end up raping the women of Biloxi. (Such breakdowns in British army discipline were rare, but not unknown.) This is exactly the kind of event that would have inflamed every Southern soldier with a desire for revenge, and when General Beauregard asks General Sherman for a truce so that he can move his troops to fight their common enemy, Sherman goes further by offering to join hs men with Beauregard's forces. This was a time when soldiers still thought in terms of honor, and Sherman was probably the most thoughtful and courageous general alive at the time. I was moved to tears by the scenes of the Bluecoats and Butternuts happily joining forces (they traded tobacco and coffee during truces, so this was also realistic) to attack the British forces. Add to this the genuine eloquence of people like Sherman and (especially) Lincoln, and the whole story was a moving experience. Turtledove's &quot;Guns of the South&quot; was extremely good (his later efforts have been more disappointing), but he never was able to capture the eloquence of Lincoln.I bought this in paperback and ordered a Hardcover copy even *before* I finished reading it.",
            "The main problem with Civil War alternate histories is that they usually find a way for the Confederacy to win; I already own two books like that, and they're written by the same author. Harrison found a way to deviate from that with a small, seemingly insignificant event from the Civil War--in this case, Price Albert dying before he could talk Queen Victoria out of retaliating after a US Navy ship took two Confederate ambassadors off a British ship--and result in a totally different outcome other than CSA endurance. While my own studies of the history of the British Empire in college made it easy to accept that the Brits' decision to take on both the Union and the Confederacy after mistaking the Stars & Bars over Mississippi for the Stars & Stripes over Maryland (an opinion of Harrison's possibly exacerbated by his living in Ireland), I had never known before that the combined forces of the Union and Confederacy were more than a match for the standing military of any European nation at the time. Light-hearted or not, accurate or otherwise, it's a good book.",
            "Most of what can be said about this book has been said already. It has an interesting premise, and terrible execution. The characters are wooden, the dialogue painfully trite, and it relies entirely too much on coincidence. The British are the most inept gaggle of ninnies ever assembled under one flag. The presto-chango reconciliation is appalling. As for Harrison's inexplicable habit of using sentence fragments, I'm not sure whether this is an indication of poor editing or a lame attempt at an experimental writing style. It amply demonstrates that there is only one Harry to read for alternative history, and Mr. Harrison is not him.But it's hardly the only bad Civil War novel. Jeff Shaara has made cranking them out into a cottage industry, and he's not the first, either. What is truly disturbing, especially for an established author like Mr. Harrison, is plagarism. Theft of intellectual property cannot be tolerated. So when Harrison uses John Stuart Mill to discuss the social and economic situation of Europe with Abraham Lincoln, he should not lift nearly two whole pages from Robert Heilbroner's book The Worldly Philosophers. Check out Heilbroner, the beginning of chapter 6. Numerous phrases inexplicably find their way into Stars and Stripes Forever. This shameful behavior, if made common knowledge, could very well end Mr. Harrison's literary career.",
            "I must have been very bored when I read this book as I actually managed to finish it and not throw it in the garbage where it belonged. Harrison must have been having a really off day when he wrote this claptrap. Having read a lot about the period that this book is set in I find the notion of the U.S. and the C.S.A. joing forces to fight the British even under the circumstances described to be way beyond even the most extreme A.H. At the time the book was set in it was the U.S. and not G.B. who were the bunglers. After all who was it that was killing each other off in huge numbers, certainly not the British. I suppose if you dislike the British this would be a good read, but if you enjoy believable A.H. then this is not the book for you."

This book moves along, and as it does, we fairly ache with the disappointment Lincoln suffered time and time again.",
            "Excellent analysis of beginning of Civil War and McClellan's rise/beginning of his fall. William's easily readable, yet thorough analysis of the political and military goings-on just prior to the fall of Fort Sumter through Antietam makes one anxious to read the complete set of Lincoln Finds a General. Obviously no fan of McCellan, Kenneth Williams makes an eloquent case against &quot;the redoubtable McC&quot; and gives a clear picture of the difficulties he made for Lincoln by his hesitancy and obtuseness. In this volume, Williams paves the way for other volumes illustrating the further trials of Linclon in his search for a military man who could help him save the nation-one who was not overawed by Bobby Lee. One can imagine his thankfulness and relief when he found Grant: &quot;I can't spare this man--he fights!&quot; As a Civil War buff of 40 years, I was enchanted by this book and have spent over 10 years searching for the complete set--I found it once in an antique book store in Columbia, SC for $350 (first edition set of the complete original volumes) at a time when that seemed a fortune to me. I wish I had gotten that set as I have never seen it again, but I have re-read this little volume so many times that it is greatly worn--proof of its readabiliy and texture. A real treat for any Civil War buff.",

And believe me, if you are a Civil War enthusiast, you will end up getting the entire collection.",

It goes into a great deal of detail and covers some things that I didn't find in either Shelby Footes 3 volume work on the civil war or in the single volume work by McPherson. It goes into considerable detail regarding McClellan's failures and shows McClellans failure to follow orders and send troops to support Pope at 2nd Bull Run which could easily have changed it from a defeat to a victory. It also shows Pope in a much better light as a general than he is usually represented. It also goes into McClellan's apparent motives for thisfailure. It leaves one anxious to read volumes II and III of the trilogy."

        "description": "Popular images of women during the American Civil War include self-sacrificing nurses, romantic spies, and brave ladies maintaining hearth and home in the absence of their men. However, as DeAnne Blanton and Lauren M. Cook show in their remarkable new study, that conventional picture does not tell the entire story. Hundreds of women assumed male aliases, disguised themselves in men\u2019s uniforms, and charged into battle as Union and Confederate soldiers\u2014facing down not only the guns of the adversary but also the gender prejudices of society. They Fought Like Demons is the first book to fully explore and explain these women, their experiences as combatants, and the controversial issues surrounding their military service. Relying on more than a decade of research in primary sources, Blanton and Cook document over 240 women in uniform and find that their reasons for fighting mirrored those of men\u2014-patriotism, honor, heritage, and a desire for excitement. Some enlisted to remain with husbands or brothers, while others had dressed as men before the war. Some so enjoyed being freed from traditional women\u2019s roles that they continued their masquerade well after 1865. The authors describe how Yankee and Rebel women soldiers eluded detection, some for many years, and even merited promotion. Their comrades often did not discover the deception until the \u201cyoung boy\u201d in their company was wounded, killed, or gave birth. In addition to examining the details of everyday military life and the harsh challenges of -warfare for these women\u2014which included injury, capture, and imprisonment\u2014Blanton and Cook discuss the female warrior as an icon in nineteenth-century popular culture and why twentieth-century historians and society ignored women soldiers\u2019 contributions. Shattering the negative assumptions long held about Civil War distaff soldiers, this sophisticated and dynamic work sheds much-needed light on an unusual and overlooked facet of the Civil War experience.",

The notion of women fighting for the Rebs and Yanks was something I had never even thought about, so reading this book served as a significant learning experience for me. Clearly, a great deal of research went into this monograph, and the authors do an excellent job of describing the significant limitations imposed upon the researcher into this topic. Military records are incomplete, especially in the case of the Confederate Army, and some women served without ever being discovered at all. In the case of many, there is no record of their real names. The best substantive evidence comes from those whose actual gender was ascertained while being treated for serious wounds or who really let the cat out of the bag by giving birth. It is quite amazing to me to learn that women in the late stage of pregnancy not only kept their gender a secret but actually fought fiercely in battle at the same time. Women soldiers were also captured and imprisoned along with men, many of them refusing to divulge their secret despite the fact it might well win them release from the terrible conditions of prison camps.Clearly, one must ask why women chose to fight. The authors devote a lot of attention to this important question. Many women took up arms in order to remain close to a loved one, be it a husband, fianc&eacute;, father, or brother; many fought for truly patriotic reasons, fuelled by the same motivations as men to defend their land and way of life. Some fought for economic reasons, knowing they could earn much more money as a soldier than they ever could as females at home; some loved the independence and removal of Victorian restrictions that a soldier's life offered them. Indeed, a small number of women had assumed male identities before the war began as a means of enjoying a better life for themselves, and some continued to live as men after the war ended for the same reasons.The aspect of this story that I found most interesting was the reaction of male soldiers and the citizenry to the role women played in fighting. To my surprise, contemporary men and women often celebrated these brave women who took up arms. The revelation of discovery often came as a shock to the female soldier's comrades in arms, but by and large they were very supportive of those who were unmasked; even years after the war ended, they lent a lot of support to female soldiers who sought the pension they truly deserved for their service. There was no shortage of newspaper stories about women soldiers during the war, and Victorian society was surprisingly supportive and proud of those women who were motivated to serve out of romantic or familial love or true patriotism. These idealized motivations appealed strongly to the romantic notions of Victorian society. Women who joined up for selfish, economic reasons, on the other hand, were often reviled. The well-known lore and widespread respect for female soldiers continued up until the days of World War I, after which society and historians in particular either ignored, ridiculed, or cast aspersions on the internecine women warriors, and it is for this reason that the history of these unique soldiers was largely forgotten over the course of the twentieth century, only reemerging as a substantive topic in the final decade before the millennium.There is much of interest in these pages: the means by which women soldiers managed to keep their real identities a secret, accounts of women in battle and the ranks several women attained as a result of their bravery and skill, stories of discovery and reenlistment(s), accounts of women captives in the worst of the prison camps, reports of children born on the front lines, information on the lives of several of these individuals in the years and decades following the war, etc. Numerous anecdotes are as informative as they are extraordinary. One of the slight issues I have with the monograph is the way in which information on each known female soldier was presented in piecemeal fashion-motivations, experiences, discovery, and the like are treated in separate chapters; I would have liked a continuous discussion of at least one prominent individual. As things stand, it is difficult to achieve deep insight into any one such person's motivations, experiences, and thoughts as a whole. This is a small criticism, however, because this book really is excellent. Featuring voluminous footnotes and an impressive bibliography, They Fought Like Demons is a landmark achievement in women's history as well as the history of the War Between the States.",
            "Neither the Union nor the Confederate Army in the Civil War authorized women to enlist or welcomed women combatants. Indeed, they were actively discouraged from the traditionaly male preserve of combat. Yet a small number of women had the drive to assume male disguise and to enlist and fight. This book helps tell their story.The authors of \"They Fought Like Demons\" DeAnne Blanton, a military archivist, and Lauren Cook, of Fayetville State University spent more than a decade in researching primary sources to recreate the role of women as Civil War combatants. Their book tells us something about roughly 250 women soldiers, who fought either for the Union or the Confederacy.The book spends a great deal of space on the motivations that caused women to disguise their sex and enlist. It finds that patriotism and devotion to their respective cause was the chief motive, as it was with men; but also finds that in many cases women enlisted to be with a male loved one, whether husband, lover, father, or brother. This latter motivation seemed important in the accounts and it seems to me different from the motivation of most male combatants.The book gives good detail on women soldiers and, in the process, of Civil War military life. It describes how many women managed to avoid detection (of course, many were unsuccessful in so doing, particularly if they were wounded), the strength with which they fought, how they were regarded by their peers, both when they were assumed to be men and following the discovery that they were women, how women were treated as prisoners of war, in hospitals, and the extent of female casualties in the war. The book discusses the lives of some of the women after their career as soldiers -- one of the most interesting aspects of the book -- and it recounts some of the literature that was published about women soldiers during the Civil War era. There was more of this than I had supposed.At the most basic level, Blanton and Cook make a convincing case that women fought in the war and contributed as soldiers on both sides. Women soldiers fought and sustained casualties at every major Civil War battle. I am a student of the Battle of Gettysburg and learned that a Confederate woman soldier died in Pickett's charge and that there were five women soldiers who were known to have fought at Gettysburg. There were also women prisoners at the notorious facility at Andersonville.The organization of the book makes it difficult to follow the activities of most of the women in detail. This difficulty is also the result of the nature of the historical records. But two or three of the female combatants left memoirs or other records which perhaps could have been highlighted more effectively in this account.It is worth remembering that there were about 2,750,000 combatants in the Civil War, 2 million for the Union, 750,000 for the Confederacy. Blanton and Cook document about 250 women soldiers and accept the general estimate of about 400 women soldiers serving in the War. This is statistically a very small amount. (One percent of 2.75 million is 27,500)It is also, of course, a tiny fractional percentage of the available pool of women. Thus, one should be hesitant about drawing broad global conclusions from this evidence. Blanton and Cook generally use their data wisely and circumspectly.The Civil War remains the pivotal experience in our Nation's history. In many respects, it remains a shared American experience. Thus, it is good to have inclusive histories and to remember the role played by women in combat. Blanton and Cook show that during Civil War times, it was known that there were small numbers of determined women in the ranks. This book does a service by recreating this part of of our national experience.",
            "Blanton gives us documented evidence of the many women who fought on both sides of the War Between the States, their motivations and how they hid their gender. Any reenactor who wants to portray a woman soldier should read this book, and it's also interesting for students of the war and those who insist women \"can't hack it in combat.\"",
            "When authors dare to delve into the subject of women as soldiers during the 1860's, they are bound to run into roadblocks and resistance. So much of the information, even in the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, ends with the female in question being anonymous. This quite simply is a result of her enlisting under a male name and dying before she is \"found out\". Blanton and Cook have made what could be a dull study into fascinating reading. Any person can say \"I would have presented the information differently\" and perhaps they would; but the facts cannot be changed any more than one can change history.Thank goodness there are folks that care enough to study and tell HERstory as well as history.",
            "I like this book. As a Social Studies teacher I am always looking for new information/interpretations of history to share with my students. To date, the subject of women as soldiers in the Civil War has been skimmed but no in depth information existed that I could find. This book is readable, informative and gives interesting information about how and why women fought and how they managed to avoid discovery. They Fought Like Demons provides that depth I've been looking for by providing the names and stories of many women within the context of the experiences of all soldiers in the Civil War.",
            "Last year I took out a book of Photographs on Women in American History and the Photo of the female soilder on the front cover of &quot; They fought like Demons&quot; was included inside only there she was listed as anonymous and there was no story. The photo has haunted me.Less than a month ago I walked into the Public Library and this book was staring at me from the recently purchased shelves.I am still reeling from all the information that I had digested.In retrospect, I look at American History so differently and wonder why this is not part of our mainstream cultural history .How does this get placed into our American history books. Girls need heroines and here they are. Lets start writing about them,creating documentaries about them, making films about them.Lets put them back into the history books.",
            "I have read They Fought Like Demons . . . and loved every word of the test. I,too, have spent 2 1/2 years conducting research on female soliders of the Civil War. Blanton's and Cook's book has provided much needed informtion for my research. Whereas, They Fought Like Demons, is written for adults, I am focusing on 5 key women in the Civil War in writing a book for children. I am a university professor who teaches elementary and middle school social studies methods and have found it truly amazing that children as well as adults have no idea that women disguised themselves as men to fight in the Civil War. I am also a storyteller and share many stories about these various women in schools, roundtables,churches, and other organizations.The point of Blanton's and Cook's book is to provide and enlighten the reader with information on women who disguised themselves as soldiers to fight in the Civil War. It is NOT intended to provide an INDEPTH review of women in the war. NO book can provide that information unless it is fiction. The authors have not attempted, but have done a great job of undetaking a monumental task of documenting as many women as possible who did fight in the war. Many of these women were unknown and it is virtually impossible to find out who they were or where they were from.I highley commend these ladies for their wonderful product and want to thank them for providing me with information that would have taken me another five or six years to complete.Dr. Judy C. PierceProfessorWestern Kentucky University",
            "The title is misleading and could have been more accurate. The book was somewhat wordy. However, it is a good introduction to the topic of women as soldiers throughout history, especially during the American Civil War. The best writing is the last couple chapters when the authors discuss their feelings on the role of women in society and specifically as soldiers.",
            "We Fought Like Demons is a very informative book on women soldiers in the Civil War. The book discusses the different identities women took and what roles they played in their troops. Some were detectives, some were nurses, some were spys, and some were even brought up to the role as lieutenant. DeAnne Blanton and Lauren M. Cook do a good job on going into great detail with each individual woman soldier. I enjoyed it and I think other readers will too.",
            "They Fought Like demons is a great book that tells about women portraying men in the Civil War. This book is very informative and helped make the fact that women fought in the Civil War as well as men noticed. In text books the fact that woman fought in war is glided over and not highlighted. With this book you can learn about all of the women that were nurses, detectives, and even lutenents. Although if you are looking for a book that is only about the Civil War in general, this is not the book for you. Although They Fought Like Demons is an entertaining book, it also has its slow parts. The book goes from exciting to slow to exciting and back to slow again. But it is still a great book. One part I find interesting is the appendix. It shares information about other books such as The Lady Lieutenant, a love story, and Castine, Also a form of a love story. The appendix has a summary of both books and has encouraged me to read both of those also. All in all I think They Fought Like Demons is a wonderful book that expresses the acomplishments and hardships of woman in the Civil War, and also helps enlighten us about at least some of the women involved in the American Civil War.",
            "This is a very entertaining and informative book about how women served as soldiers in the Civil War. I highly recommend this book! Very educational.",
            "This book was written well and informative considering the secrecy and lack of information of the woman who fought. As stated in the book, women, under the disguise as men, fought for their country or to follow their male family members or husbands into war. Often the true identity of these women were not discovered until their death. For such a private and secret matter the book had a lot of information to give on a subject that you think would lacking. I enjoyed this book and God love those women who had such guts!",
            "This is a significant book on women in the Civil War. Although based on scholarly research, it is a good read and full of information. It doesn't try to cover ALL women in the Civil War. The concentration is mostly on women in combat roles. It is unlike the many books on female spies, which are often based on legends, some created several years after the war to sell magazines. And, you don't have to be a Civil War scholar to enjoy this book. Book purchased from Amazon. I have no connection to or acquaintance with the authors.",
            "This book is a little dry but seemingly factual. I expected more of a story line than this offered. I certainly did learn a few things about women and the civil war.",
            "This is an excellent book which has been thouroughly researched. The authors carefully support their information with documentation. It is well written and scholarly. It is for the hobbyist and historian, especially women who enjoy Civil War history.",
            "Bought this book for my daughter's school reading and it is in very good condition to be a used copy. A value indeed. I plan on donating this book to our local library for future reader use. It has some hilarious reading in there. Since it is required reading for a class I didn't think it would be that good. I was wrong. Learned a lot about women of our country back in the day.",
            "Blanton and Cook's book about women soldiers serving in both the Northern and Southern Armies is entertaining. But be forwarned, it does have a halting style of writing. It drags in places and flies in others.Well researched, the book does advance the topic of women serving as men during the civil war. And it does cover a few battles. However, if you're looking for light reading or looking for a general book on the civil war, then you need to keep looking.As I worked my way through the book I did keep pondering the question of sister fighting sister, or mother fighting mother. We certainly make much of the brother against brother of son against father aspects of this conflict. I wonder how many woment really did fight during the civil war in both armies? I don't know that we'll ever know that answer, but not because Blanton and Cook didn't try to find out.",
            "Women who fought as men in the Civil War, for whatever reasons, followed their own hearts, created their own destinies and, if a glass ceiling existed, they smashed it to smithereens.Blanton and Cook, superb researchers, present more facts about women fighting in the Civil War than we've had before, and in an interesting way.I went on to buy The History Channel's \"Secret Soldiers of the Civil War,\" available not in the History Channel's shop, but on Amazon.com, concerning two of the women soldiers written about in Blanton and Cook's book.[...]",
            "This book was a hard read. I just couldn't wait to be done with it. The book would bring up women numerous times in different chapters but never clearly told any woman's story at once. All I really walked away with was \"There were women fighting in the Civil War.\" Exactly the same thing I learned from the cover. The pictures are exellent though. It would have been nice to have more of them, but I guess there aren't a lot of them surviving. It's interesting, I just wish things weren't repeated so much and that there was a little more information.",
            "I reenact the War Between the States and I am constantly on the lookout for new books to read. I came across this book and decided it would be an interesting topic of study. When I picked up this book, I expected to read a book that would delve into the letters written by women who served in the Union and Confederate armies to illustrate their lives as soldiers. I was disappointed when the authors failed to rely on the letters as the primary source of their subject, and instead they decided to flaunt liberal feminism as the model which all women during the period of the War Between the States should have ascribed to.The facts that are brought to light by the authors are truly astounding, such as how these women enlisted, how they were able to live undetected in camp, but the book could have been much better if it had kept the letters of/about the women as the primary source of the subject.Another thing that bothered me was how the authors arrived at some presumptuous statistics with so few source documents. The authors admit that their is only evidence for 250 women who served in the War Between the States, yet they compare statistics from these 250 women against the statistics of the 3,300,000 men who served. These sort of statistics are dubious at best.I admire the authors for writing a book on such a topic. I just wish they would have let the source documents speak for themselves instead of flaunting liberal feminism as the ideal for women during the War Between the States.",
            "The book was exactly as described and shipment was immediate. This buying experience could not have been better.",
            "I'll read just about anything about the Civil War except Ph.D. theses, but the political agenda, constant repetition, and lack of significant detail make THEY FOUGHT LIKE DEMONS awfully tough sledding.The introduction and chapter one are about as readable as the phone book. I almost gave up. Chapter two is a little better because Blanton and Cook introduce us to such stalwarts as Sarah Emma Edmonds, Albert D. J. Cashier, and Sarah Rosetta Wakeman, for whom they have extensive information. Edmonds wrote a best-selling memoir after the war; Cashier, who dressed as a man prior to the war, served out her entire enlistment without being discovered until she was sent to a mental hospital as an old &quot;man,&quot; and Wakeman's letters to her family were preserved. The most entertaining of the three is the feisty Wakeman, who gets into a fight with a fellow soldier and wins. A picture section lets of decide for ourselves whether these women could possibly pass for men.Rather than rely on the letters, memoirs and newspaper accounts they unearthed, Blanton and Cook spend much of the book dispelling such notions that most women who fought in the Civil War were lesbians, prostitutes or camp followers. They maintain that most of the women fought for the same reasons men did: for the money, for adventure and because of patriotism. But only 240 women can be proved to have served, most under aliases which were almost impossible to track. Blanton and Cook use a sample of 153. From this number they arrive at some rather suspect statistics. Forty-four percent were casualties; eighteen percent were captured by the enemy; their promotion rate was eighteen percent, better than the ten percent cited for men. We're talking over two million men here; I doubt a statistician would allow this sort of comparison.Some chapters are rather funny. Take Chapter seven: &quot;A Congenital Peculiarity,&quot; Women Discovered in the Ranks. Two were detected when an officer threw apples at them; they were in uniform but reflexively tried to catch them with their non-existent aprons. Another was discovered because of her feminine method of putting on her stockings.There are certainly better Civil War books out there: CONFEDERATES IN THE ATTIC by Tony Horwitz and SLAVES IN THE FAMILY by Edward Ball to name two.",
            "This was my first book I have read written by these authors, and I was not disappointed. Although it was a little hard to follow because they switched characters a lot, I did enjoy it. I thought only a few women participated in the wars throughout the years, when in fact there were many. The book was separated into different sections to make it easier to follow and go along with. One of the sections I enjoyed the most was when they described how women passed as men. There were also sections on \"Life in the Ranks,\" and \"Women discovered in the ranks.\" I learned that most of the women were not discovered as women until they were dead. This novel was very interesting, and proved just how far a women wold go to serve for her country. I admire the women who broke the mold and did what only men were thought to be able to do.",
            "In the book They Fought Like Demons, the authors have made an effort to tell the story of female participants in the Civil War from a different perspective - that of women as soldiers.The book is not terribly long, and has numerous stories of women participating in the war, but it was evident to me quite early that the study focuses on only a few different individuals, with tidbits about other women added to make the author's points. I give the book only three stars because I do not think that the authors delve deeply enough into questions of how women fought.There is no question that this is a valuable book, and a story that needed to be told, but I do not believe that the book addresses the critical question of how valuable women were in the war effort. It does satisfy, in a strong way, the need to understand that women were indeed patriotic, and had a desire to fight to preserve (or create) their country. However, I believe that there are too many instances of &quot;this woman suffered an unknown fate&quot;, or mere mentions of an &quot;unknown woman&quot; participating in the battle and discovered as the burial detail performed their grim tasks.I recommend this book to anyone that is looking for an understanding of women's participation in the civil war on an &quot;outside of the house&quot; front, but I do not recommend the book if you're looking for an understanding of women's doings in the midst of battle.",
            "this was an interesting book, but it does not contain hardly any information on women from the south. there are some opinions expressed that show the authors are biased toward the union. so if you are searching for information pertaining to the Confederate women, don't read this book.",
            "I bought this book for my mother as she really likes to read about women in history. When I recieved it I thumbed through it and found it to read more like a text book and not something one would choose for an afernoon of pleasure reading.",
            "I read this book because it was my book club's choice. The best thing about a book club is you sometimes read a book you might not have read otherwise and the worst thing about a book club is you sometimes read a book you might not have read otherwise. This one falls under the second. No continuity, no story, just a compilation of research results. It might work as a thesis to fulfill a degree program but not as general reading. Boring."

        "description": "Two and a half months after the Confederate Army\u2019s drive into Union territory had been checked by the Federals at Gettysburg, the two armies met near Chattanooga, Tennessee, to dispute control of the west. Here they locked in the bloody battle of Chickamauga, one of the most hotly contested engagements of American history, and one of the most extraordinary. For two days \u2014September 19 and 20, 1863 \u2014 125,000 men struggled for the prize city of Chattanooga in terrain more like a jungle than a battlefield. All regarded the battle as decisive. On its outcome depended, for the South, the fate of Atlanta and all Georgia. For the North, it promised the one opportunity to cut the Confederacy through the middle and possibly end the war before Christmas. For the courage they displayed, these men surpassed any in the wars of western civilization. It was, perhaps above all else from the strategist\u2019s point of view, a battle of strong personalities. Leading the Federals was William Starke Rosecrans, of German ancestry, hot-tempered and sometimes vacillating. Opposed to him was the hard-fighting, brave and resourceful Braxton Bragg, a martinet who could be slow moving and careless in supervising the execution of his orders. Possibly most outstanding of all was the Union General George Henry Thomas, whose remarkable courage and tactical skill saved his side from overwhelming defeat and earned him the sobriquet of \u201cRock of Chickamauga.\"",

            "One of the major problems of Civil War history is that it can easily be told in the most boring of ways. Unit vs unit. Positioning of regiments. Lengthy debates about flanks being left up in the air. Detail IS important to any history, but what sets Glenn Tucker apart from so many other authors of this genre is that he tells a hell of a fine story. Because of his writing, he has become one of my top two favorite Civil War authors (Dowdy being the other, although you could make a fine argument for Shelby Foote too). Tucker takes this pivotable battle in the west - the equivalent of Gettysburg - and brings it alive through the people who fought the battle - the privates and the generals, the farmers and the townspeople. It's easy to assume the Union was saved at Gettysburg. In truth, it could have been lost at Chichamauga just a few months later.",
            "Not much can be added to the previous review, I fully agree on the comments made. A well researched and presented book, very easy to read and follow. One of the best books on this battle I have read to date (this authors book on Gettysburg was one of the first books I had ever read on the American Civil War and I reckon one of the easiest to read on that famous battle). This book is worth the time to sit down and relax and enjoy a good read with a cup of coffee!",
            "Glenn Tucker won the Fletcher Pratt Award for his very good book 'Chickamauga: Bloody Battle in the West' in 1961. Reading the book one can still see why. Though superseded by Peter Cozzens' 1992 'This Terrible Sound' I believe that Tucker's book on Chickamauga still has quite a bit of merit. Tucker writes in the charming 'old school' fashion of a Bruce Catton that is very easy to read. His book has decent maps and his writing makes the campaign and battle easier to follow. He also does a good job at sketching personalities and Braxton Bragg, William Rosecrans, George Thomas, James Longstreet and Nathan Bedford Forrest come alive in his pages. He is sympathetic to these flawed but all fascinating characters. The average foot soldier is also not forgotten. Tucker also is very good in depicting the ebb and the flow of the battle and the harshness of the fighting, terrain, and climate. His endnotes also contain some good information, containing especially interesting info on the odd weather conditions of 1863 in the United States.Highly recommended!"

        "description": "\" Winner of the Seaborg Award A History Book Club Selection On October 8, 1862, Union and Confederate forces clashed near Perryville, Kentucky, in what would be the largest battle ever fought on Kentucky soil. The climax of a campaign that began two months before in northern Mississippi, Perryville came to be recognized as the high water mark of the western Confederacy. Some said the hard-fought battle, forever remembered by participants for its sheer savagery and for their commanders\u2019 confusion, was the worst battle of the war, losing the last chance to bring the Commonwealth into the Confederacy and leaving Kentucky firmly under Federal control. Although Gen. Braxton Bragg\u2019s Confederates won the day, Bragg soon retreated in the face of Gen. Don Carlos Buell\u2019s overwhelming numbers. Perryville: This Grand Havoc of Battle is the definitive account of this important conflict. While providing all the parry and thrust one might expect from an excellent battle narrative, the book also reflects the new trends in Civil War history in its concern for ordinary soldiers and civilians caught in the slaughterhouse. The last chapter, unique among Civil War battle narratives, even discusses the battle\u2019s veterans, their families, efforts to preserve the battlefield, and the many ways Americans have remembered and commemorated Perryville.

            "&quot;Perryville - This Grand Havoc of Battle&quot; is a great work of thorough research and presentation. The most recent book written about the civil war Battle of Perryville, Kennenth Noe sets the stage in providing the reader w/ a context of the civil war itself and the events leading up to the encounter between General Carlos Buells'(Union) and General Braxton Braggs'(Confederates) men in this little central Kentucky town. With Perryville being home to me all my life, my interest is of course more personal, but civil war history has always intrigued both my brother and I, who have always taken in the re-enactment of the Battle of Perryville since we were kids. We grew up playing on the beautiful rolling hills of Perryville Battlefield State Park. It's amazing to think that our childhood place of play was once a bloody battlefield. It's also amazing to me to know the very land we live on was most likely traveled &amp; camped upon by Union or Confederate forces, perhaps both.The Battle of Perryville is probably one of the least understood battles of the civil war. While battles like Gettysberg and Shiloh are better known, Perryville was one of the biggest turning points in the war and certainly for Kentucky, as it was truly the Confederacy's last effort at winning the state. It was the largest battle ever fought on Kentucky soil. I think Noe does a remarkable job in helping the reader to understand the significance of the battle of Perryville. With guidance from locals here who are the most knowledgable when it comes to the accuracy of this battle, Noe's depication of detail is impressive, or so I found. He includes research never before written of. One of the more notable sections I found really interesting was how this battle affected the families of those soliders who fought at Perryville and how the towns people were affected by the aftermath of it - they were literally left to &quot;pick up the pieces.&quot; After reading this section, I realized more than ever, that the magnitude of devastion must have been very overwhelming to all involved. Living here, it's really interesting to tangibly see present day landmarks that played a role of some sort in the battle. Overall, I feel Noe brought to light the significance of Perryville in both the social and political realms of the civil war. The book includes maps, pictures and illustrations and it concludes with a chapter entitled &quot;The World Has Changed,&quot; which as I stated earlier, describes the days, weeks, and years of the lives of those soliders, families, and towns people following the battle. Noe also includes present day information regarding the preservation of Perryville and Perryville Battlefield State Park.If you're a civil war buff, I would think this book would be of interest to you. It certainly would be to those who are Kentuckians, as it is provides the legacy of our state concerning the war. It's well researched, well written and a really good read.",
            "Kenneth Noe's book is a fantastic addition to the recent books dealing with obscure Western battles. It expands upon the previously small amount of material dealing with Bragg's Kentucky campaign and its climax on the fields of a small town called Perryville. The book is quite readable, and is filled with first-hand descriptions from period accounts, some of which are absolutely fascinating.Overall, I found this to be a very good read. The book seemed to flow well, and I never got bogged down in dry facts. One minor quibble is that the maps sometimes were hard to reconcile with the text. Eventually I would get to the part of the narrative that corresponded to the map, but I had to use my imagination sometimes to fill in the blanks. Also, there were several towns and/or brigades mentioned that were not labeled on the appropriate map, or were not clear. However, I could usually figure out where they would have been located by using other maps, and overall it did not hurt the main story.Noe also tries to draw some new conclusions about different facets of the battle, but I did not get the sense that he was trying to rigidly rewrite history. He does imply that they are new interpretations and not solid facts. This allows the readers to decide for themselves, instead of having a new theory forced upon them by a pretentious author as the final word on the subject. This was refreshing, and really made the book more enjoyable and intelligent.If you enjoyed Shea and Hess's account of Pea Ridge, or Cozzen's book on Iuka and Corinth, I think you will find this book to be similar in style and tone. It does not quite match the Pea Ridge book, but it is very close, and I would recommend it as the best current book on Perryville. If you want to understand a little-known battle which was the high-water mark of the Western Confederacy, it is a must read.",
            "An unfailingly interesting account by a fine historian. Kenneth W. Noe has made sense of one of the most neglected and confusing campaigns of the entire Civil War. He has sorted through the geographical complexities and factionalism in both armies to show his readers why people should still care about what happened near an obscure Kentucky village over 140 years ago. His work is truly a pioneering one. Unlike most campaign studies, this excellent book pays considerable attention to the treatment of the wounded, the effects of battle on the local landscape, the lives of veterans after the war, and even how the battlefield itself was interpreted and preserved. It will be the standard account for many years to come.",
            "The Battle of Perryville, which took place in central Kentucky in October 1862, was in my opinion one of the most important battles of the Civil War. In a day of intense combat, Confederate and Federal troops fought over the Chaplin Hills northwest and west of the little (even to today) town of Perryville. In the end, the Southerners had gained a tactical victory, but lost the campaign, perhaps ending the last chance the Confederacy had of bringing in Kentucky.In \"Perryville: This Grand Havoc of Battle,\" Kenneth W. Noe provides the reader with an excellent study of the battle. From the Confederate movement northward from Chattanooga to their subsequent retreat back to the Volunteer State, Mr. Noe covers all the important events. He is very critical of Union General Don Carlos Buell's handling of the Army of the Ohio during the maneuvering in Middle Tennessee, and also reveals the in-fighting, and discontent, present within that army throughout this campaign. Mr. Noe covers the entire campaign, from start to finish, very well.The maps in this book are second to none, allowing the reader to easily follow the movements of both Northern and Southern soldiers, as well as understand the topograpy of the battlefield. Interspersed throughout the narrative are old photos of commanders involved in the battle and of the battlefield, along with modern photos of sites on the battlefield. Combine these with Mr. Noe's excellent writing and one has a great narrative of the 1862 Kentucky Campaign.The Battle of Perryville has been all but ingored by Civil War historians. However, Mr. Noe has gone far in bringing this deserving battle to the forefront. No Civil War library is complete without this book. After reading this book, I find myself hoping that Mr. Noe will continue to write volumes on Civil War campaigns. Get this book!",
            "This past summer (2002) I walked the Perryville battlefield. It was a hot bright summer day with the temperature in the 90's. The tour follows the advance of the attacking Confederates as they assaulted up one hill and down the other. As the southern infantry wrestled the Union defenders off the crest of one hill, the latter retreated to the top of another, only to repeat the bloody slaughter. Dressed in light summer garb, and taking the tour at a moderate pace, I was simply exausted from both the heat and the rugged terrain. I could not help but wonder what it was like for Johnny Reb and Billy Yank dressed in hot woolen uniforms on 8 October 1862 (also a blistering day). Unlike my leisurely walk, the fighting and dying lasted all that day.Historian Kenneth W. Noe more than likely must had painted a similar mental picture. In his book _Perryville: This Grand Havoc of Battle_, Noe not only provides a grand overview of the campaign for Kentucky in 1862, but also brings back an art sometimes forgotten by recent historians: the battle narrative. The titles of Noe's chapters alone describe the nature of the combat: \"A Babel of Confusion;\" \"A Small Sized Hell;\" \"Forward;\" \"A Square, Stand-Up...Fight;\" and \"Up the Hill Came the Rebels.\" Although the Confederates were credited with a \"tactical victory,\" there were no winners at Perryville. Just as the Gettysburg citizens would be left with cleaning up the squalor of battle, so too were the scattered residents of Perryville whose homes became make-shift field hospitals. Noe consulted a vast array of sources for this scholarly treatment. Perhaps his best acomplice was Perryville park manager Kurt Holman, whose job is his passion. Holman offered Noe his unabided help on one condition: that Noe \"get it right!\" Noe's narrative flows evenly between higher headquarters and the musket toting private. I did not experience the difficulty with the maps expressed by other reviewers. I thought the maps were clear and simple, especially those showing the gradiant lines of the hills for which the soldiers fought. Perhaps Noe's book will not change the fact that the battle of Perryville pales compared to the larger battles in both the eastern and western theaters. Noe does, however, get the message across that Perryville was a confusing bloody day's battle fought with the musket and the bayonet. Noe's effort is a valuable addition to the literature of the Civil War in the West.",
            "Perryville may not be one of the best-known Civil War battles, but its story is well worth telling. Kenneth Noe does a good job in explaining the events of October 8th 1862, making a complex and confusing battle comprehensible. He puts the battle into context by explaining why Braxton Bragg's Confederate Army of the Mississippi headed into Kentucky. The prize at stake was the allegiance of the border state, whether it would follow the South or stay in the Union.Noe is fairly critical of Bragg, even arguing that he suffered from mental illness. This is one of the least successful aspects of his analysis. Noe recognises the dangers of using modern psychiatry to investigate historical figures, but then proceeds to expose his analysis to just this danger by classifying Bragg as a manic-depressive. Bragg had his faults and in the Perryville campaign made mistakes, but the fact remains that his 16,000 men took on Buell's 55,000 man Army of the Ohio and beat them. Bragg's leadership does not look quite so insane when it is remembered that he won the battle. Noe is not nearly as critical of Buell, but it would be equally easy to apply a psychiatric analysis to a man who was miles away from the fighting while his army fought for its life. Noe's analysis generally does not give enough credit to the Confederate performance and rather whitewashes the Union army. Bragg's army faced odds at least as bad as Lee's army did at Chancellorsville, yet the Army of the Potomac is routinely condemned for its performance there, and Lee's leadership is generally praised while Hooker's is usually criticised. Bragg should certainly get some credit for the victory at Perryville and should not be put on the psychiatrist's couch.Noe should however, be praised for the depth of his research and the clarity of his writing. He uses contemporary sources well to give the reader a sense of what it was like to be fighting the battle. His book is not an especially easy read, but this has more to do with the complexity of the battle, than any faults in Noe's style of writing. It would have helped to have a few more maps. The maps, which are provided, are adequate, but not as good as in some other Civil War books. These criticisms though, are outweighed by the merits of Noe's book. I very much enjoyed reading it and learned a great deal about an important and interesting battle.",
            "Perryville has been pretty much ignored by Civil War historians except for Kenneth Hafendorfer's poineering book and this one, which is newer, better researched, and has better (but far fewer) maps. Professor Noe has pretty much written the definitive account of this fairly obscure battle. It covers, besides the battle itself, all of Bragg's campaign in Kentucky, from the viewpoints of generals, soldiers, and civilians alike and his views are reasonable, unbiased, and well thought out. Additionally, he writes well and the book was a real joy to read. Highly recommended.",
            "I read Noe's \"Perryville: This Grand Havoc of Battle\" (\"grand havoc of battle\" is a quote from Sam Watkin's of the 1st Tennessee on his participation in the hottest fighting he ever faced from Shiloh to surrender)just before visiting the battlefield park. I found the description of the campaign leading the battle to be excellent, and the details of 8 Oct 1862 were well described. Unlike other some other readers, I found the maps to be very helpful in understanding the battle -- I only wished there were more! The discussion of Bragg is fair and balanced; the mild psychoanaysis was helpful and insightful.I particularly enjoyed reading about the pre-battle conflicts between the Union troops and their search for food and water from private lands enroute to Perryville -- and the occasional sheltering of escaped slaves -- contrasted with some officers intent to stop the \"pilaging\" and return \"property\" to slave-owners. More than one example of men in the ranks promising to kill their own officers in the next battle is given. Not to mention the murder of General \"Bull\" Nelson by Union general Jefferson C. Davis. That crime went unpunished... and Noe explains all sides fairly. Riveting stuff, well told, and extremely helpful in preparing to walk those rolling hills themselves...",
            "The other reviews (those in the four and five star range) already mention the attention to detail and well-written style of Mr. Noe's book. I just wanted to state that this is the DEFINITIVE work on Perryville, surpassing Hafendorfer's previous effort. I only wish there were more maps!Having tramped Perryville several times with, I can say without question that Mr. Noe has laid out this little known and confusing battle very well, and that anyone who has rated this book less than fours stars is completely off the mark.",

            "Writing a history of the Perryville Campaign must be more difficult than doing a study of, say, Gettysburg: the Kentucky campaign was prolonged, embraced a wide geographical area (from Corinth, MS, to Chattanooga, TN, and from the Cumberland Gap to the Ohio River), and none of the leading commanders had a clear objective, or, for that matter, even knew what was really going on. Kenneth Noe makes this campaign as clear as is humanly possible, sorting through the misunderstandings, miscommunications, faulty intelligence, and overall bad generalship that characterized both sides in this drawn-out, inconclusive, but ultimately important campaign. The study is full of detail, and anecdote,and the writing-style flawless. If either Gen.Bragg or Gen.Buell had been as intelligent, or informed as Mr.Noe, Perryville would have been a striking contest indeed, instead of the meandering farce it actually was.",
            "Many soldiers from my home town fought in this battle. One of my families Great Great Grandfathers was one of them. I am looking for all of the information I can find on this battle to find the actual story and conditions of the battle. Mr. Noe has packed this book full of facts. The notes and Works Consulted are excellent!",
            "Kenneth Noe's massively researched volume replaces Kenneth Hafendorfer's PERRYVILLE as the stock work on this little written-about Civil War battle. Noe has done yeoman work amongst the dusty shelves to bring to bear data from regimentals, family papers and personal accounts. He's accompanied his exemplary research with a good order of battle and decent maps. His bibliography will provide future students an excellent foundation for researching the war in Kentucky. I purchased this volume for the same reason I own Hafendorfer's work -a relative of mine served with the 24th Mississippi Infantry. Unfortunately I found the research more impressive than the writing; purely a personal judgement. I also found the author's attempts at psychoanalyzing key players less than convincing. Given the paucity of sources on Perryville and its modest price I would recommend this book for scholars of the war. Again, the author should be commended for a truly impressive research effort (&amp; for depositing his notes at Perryville)",
            "Most books written about the War Between the States focus on the East, mainly Virginia. This one is quite different, it focuses on the battle for the States of Kentucky and Tennessee. These were so called &quot;border&quot; states and the natives were pretty equally split between southern and northern sympathizers.The author provides a very detailed account of the conflict between the Confederate forces under the generalship of Braxton Bragg battling with the Union Forces under the direction of General Don Carlos Buell. But the conflict was not just between these two armies. Much conflict existed between the generals and officers within both the Confederate and the Union forces. There was no respect for eithe Bragg or Buell from their respective underlings.One complaint I have - not being familiar with the territory on which these battles took place - is the lack of definition for that territory. I feel most CW enthusiasts are a bit ignorant re the battle for these border states and do not know exactly where Perryville is. The author could have been a lot more helpful. Yes, there are maps. But they are woeful. The ledgends on the maps are in very small print and difficult to read. The activities of the armies are shown by lines and arrows, but this is also confusing. Confederate movements are shown by black lines and arrows; Union movements by grey. When the map is printed there is little distinction on the map between black and grey. Also, the pictures shown are relatively poor. Photographs of the various officers are fine; but landscapes, houses, etc. leave a lot to be desired.The tale, itself, was pretty well told. However, often unnecessary detalil broke the action. I found it difficult to have a continued interest in the story and consequently had to &quot;force&quot; myself thru. Nevertheless when I finished I felt satisfied that I had become knowledgeable about another area of the War with which I had been entirely unfamiliar.",
            "Braxton Bragg's campaign into Kentucky in the late summer and early autumn of 1862 is an often neglected chapter in Civil War history. Noe's book is a thorough exploration of the campaign based on use of primary and secondary sources. While a solid account, the author's digressions into retrospective psychoanalysis are a bit silly and lessen the credibility of the book as serious history. Nevertheless, it is worth reading. Like many university press histories, however, it is degraded by poor maps. The award of three stars is just a little bit generous. It's really a two and a half!"

            "This is an extraordinary collection, conventional wisdom at its very best, and would have to be considered a fundamental and useful reference. It does, however, have a weak underbelly, and misses the edge of truly breath-taking genius.I will sum it up concisely: every one of these pieces adheres to the core idea that that what we are doing in general is adequate, we simply need to do it a bit differently. Even authors who have been brilliant, such as Laurie Garrett, who clearly documents in her book Betrayal of Trust: The Collapse of Global Public Health, that the real enemy is bacteria and disease, and the collapse of preventive public health in favor of the more expensive medication and remediation approach, have been \"subverted\" as it were, in how they are represented here.We spend half a penny of the taxpayer dollar on foreign aid--we spend 16 cents of the taxpayer dollar on military defense that is useful roughly ten percent of the time. Let me say this in a different way: we spent 32 times more on military weapons and forces useful only 10% of the time, than we do on addressing what George Soros calls \"the other axis of evil--poverty, disease and ignorance.\"Several of the articles by folks I admire and respect, are simply off the mark--the article on intelligence, for example, tends to accept the attacks as unpreventable and unpredictable, while failing to note that we have been spending less than 2% of our intelligence budget on terrorism, and that our continuing excesses in technical collection (85% of the intelligence budget) have forced the consistent underfunding of everything else including serious clandestine operations, access to foreign-language open sources, and top-notch analysts who actually have the deep foreign historical, cultural, and language knowledge necessary to make sense of it all. The fact that our intelligence community spends $30 billion a year and more on the 5% of the information it can steal, and less than one half of one percent on foreign language open sources, suggests such a severe imbalance that in a person, this would be called lunacy--instead, we use secrecy to delay a full accounting, and elected politicians who don't know any better tell our citizens that we have the best intelligence we could have had. That is utter nonsense and should be exposed as ignorance at the highest levels about what intelligence can or cannot do.Others refer to Afghanistan as unconquerable, a view that prevailed within the Administration until Russian President Putin persuaded our President that we could take Kabul before the winter set in. The articles on defense assume that we should spend a bit more on confronting rogue nations, but do not really get into the larger trade-offs, between hard power and soft power, between force and assistance, between state on state and people on people accommodations.Nowhere in this book, which is excellent and a must read, do we learn of the daunting water shortages that threaten to further destabilize China, Turkey and Egypt, Russia, and other less developed areas already producing plagues, refugees, and corruption. This book addresses terrorism as an annoyance, as something we can deal with if we simply adjust our corporate organization a tad. It does not go deeply into the much larger issues, and rather than suggesting that such readings are available elsewhere (they are not, at least in a single work), I will end by complementing the editors of this work, and suggesting that they go to work immediately on a sequel--only this time, we need a sequel that highlights both the deep conditions of poverty, disease, conflict and ignorance that characterize the world within which we live, and the iconoclastic authorities-most of them not American and none of them \"members of the club\"-whose views will cause discomfort to those who still think they are in charge.",
            "How is it that former deputy security advisor Sandy Berger rates as an authority on how 9/11 happened? Dick Morris, Clinton's political advisor during Berger's tenure in the White House, singles out Berger for particular scorn in a recent Wall Street Journal essay, claiming that Berger \"seemed to work overtime at opposing tough measures against terror.\"Put another way, asking Sandy Berger to explain how 9/11 happened is like asking Neville Chamberlain to explain the origins of Nazi aggression.",
            "Let's see. Contributors to this collection include: Bill Clinton's secretary of defense; Bill Clinton's national security advisor; a raft of folks from Bill Clinton's National Security Council; Bill Clinton's hand-picked chairman of the Joint Chiefs and his Supreme Allied Commander, Europe; and the chairman of Bill Clinton's Council of Economic Advisors. If one thing is clear, even from reading just the table of contents, it's that the answer to the title question won't involve pointing many fingers at America's forty-second president.And it turns out it doesn't. As befits Foreign Affairs magazine, which assembled the essays published here, the contributors are all pillars of the Foreign Policy Establishment (can you get more ubiquitous than Brian Jenkins?). Consequently, few of the analyses or recommendations venture far from what you'd find on the New York Times op-ed page.I thought the first four essays were the best in the book. They analyzed the September 11 terrorists themselves, the Middle Eastern culture whence they sprang, and the impact of America's quest for a Pax Americana. Once the focus turned from history and sociology to defense and counter-terrorism strategies, the voice of Conventional Wisdom was clearly recognizable.Sandy Berger's offering is typical: 'First, we must dismantle and destroy the terror groups arrayed against us, and their support systems, using every tool at our disposal, including military force. In so doing, we must use that force in a way that isolates the extremists without isolating us. ... Second, we must bring more of our diplomatic, political, intellectual, and economic energy to the Islamic world ... Third, we must actively seek to reverse the spiral of violence in the Middle East...' (p. 126-127). It says so much, and yet so little.In the next essay, William Wechsler argues that President Clinton did the right thing in targeting the Al Qaeda financial structure, and that President Bush needs to keep doing it, and also start doing it again. The bad guys here, it turns out, were Phil Gramm and Paul O'Neill, who failed to recognize the wisdom of the Clinton approach.Another theme runs through these latter essays too. 'The U.S. government needs more power to (Wechsler, p. 142) ... the key for [Tom] Ridge will be budgetary authority (Nye, p. 206) ... devote more funding to intelligence and law enforcement programs (Perry, p. 237) ... there simply wasn't enough money in the defense budgets (Clark, p. 246)' ... and on, and on. A nice contrast was Richard Betts' clear-eyed piece about the U.S. intelligence community, its 'failures' in the war against terrorism, and what the American people can and legitimately should expect from our intelligence agencies.In all, there is some good background and historical material here, and a few insights into establishment thinking on terrorism and how to deal with it. But few people who've been paying attention to these issues will fund much here that's new.",
            "For those who wish to understand both \"how\" and \"why\" events on September 11th occurred, I think this is the best single-source of information and analysis. Hoge and Rose have assembled and edited 23 essays written by a commendably diverse number of authorities on separate but related subjects which include an \"anatomy of the terrorist attack\" (Brian M. Jenkins). \"Islam through history\" (Karen Armstrong), \"prevention, deterrence, defense\" (William J. Perry), \"the economic repercussions\" (Martin N. Bailey), and \"what September 11th hath wrought\" (Fareed Zakaria). Obviously, all of us (including these and other authorities) are still sorting through and correlating new information as it becomes available. Definitive \"answers\" to the questions we now ask may not be determined for years and perhaps not for decades. Obviously, the events which occurred on September 11th did not occur in a vacuum. Moreover, the implications and consequences of those events continue to reveal themselves. For me, this anthology's greatest value lies in the frame of reference which the essayists create. Hoge and Rose conclude their Introduction as follows: \"As we mourn the dead, we must also absorb the lessons, some of which are grim. Additional terrorist attacks on America are likely. Chemical and biological weapons may be used. September 11, an outrage and a tragedy for us, is an inspiration for terrorists. Only preparedness, determination, and ultimately, self-confidence can offset the forebodings. The moral that Winston Churchill chose for his towering history of the previous global conflict is as apt now as it was then:In War: ResolutionIn Defeat: DefianceIn Victory: MagnanimityIn Peace: GoodwillThose who carefully read this book will also be better prepared to understand what has yet to occur, not only in the United States but throughout the world.",
            "Hoge and Rose are the editor and managing editor, respectively, of Foreign Affairs. The title asks the question, referring to 9/11, and the various essays in the book collectively answer it. There are 23 essays in the book that approach 9/11 from a wide variety of angles. The authors, each a recognized expert in his/her field, are a bunch of very smart, experienced people giving their take on what happened, why it happened, and what it means. No matter what your particular area of interest is - geopolitics, military, sociology, etc. - there's something in this book for you.Take, for example, the essay \"Was It Inevitable ~ Islam Through History,\" by Karen Armstrong. She admires the virtues of Islam and views the current (last few decades) spate of terrorism in an Islamic fundamentalist historical context. It is an attempt at reform (islah) and renewal (tajdid). \"This type of reform, which tried to go back to the fundamentals, became known as the Salafiyya because it looked back to al-Salaf al-Salih, 'the venerable forefathers'\" (pg. 65). One of the most famous of these reform movements was Wahhabi, which is the brand of Islam practiced today in Saudi Arabia and in which Osama bin Laden was born.Contrast this with Walter Laquer (in his essay \"Left, Right, and Beyond ~ The Changing Face of Terror\"). He puts it in the context of a more general history of terrorism and explains (pg. 76) the rise of Islamist radicalism (terrorism) as the result of a decline of political doctrines and the emergence of a spiritual and intellectual vacuum, albeit the connection is not always straightforward (pg. 77).Other examples of the plentitude of ideas abound. Milton Beardon (\"Graveyard of Empires ~ Afghanistan's Treacherous Peaks\") provides a brief, but excellent background on the rise of the Taliban and its Arab influence (the so called Afghan Arabs). Richard K. Betts (\"Intelligence Test ~ The Limits of Prevention\") provides an outstanding thumbnail analysis of the problems facing the intelligence community in the post-Cold War world. \"The All-to-Friendly Skies ~ Security as an Afterthought\", by Gregg Easterbrook is alarming, even in retrospect. It provides valuable insight into commercial operations, such as (pg. 179) the point at which commercial airplane pilots actually take command of a given flight and why some pilots want an earlier assumption of that command. \"The Unguarded Homeland ~ A Study in Malign Neglect\" by Stephen E. Flynn describes how the nature of our economic infrastructure, with its interconnectedness, lack of redundancy, and heavy reliance on private security, increases our vulnerability to attack (i.e., to critical interdiction). He also describes the strain on the US Customs Service, the Coast Guard, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and other government agencies.The list goes on. The essays provide not only a description of the social and political environment in which 9/11 occurred, but also offer policy options (such as in \"The New Security Mantra - Prevention, Deterrence, and Defense\" by William J. Perry). The book includes a sobering piece by Anatol Lieven (\"The Cold War Is Over ~ The True Significance of the Attacks\").A clear message emerges. What made us vulnerable was a combination of a certain amount of complacency born of arrogance due to no recent US airliner hijackings (no successful attempts for the past 14 years - pg. 166), a low appreciation of the threat based on patterns of terrorist activity as well as an improperly focused intelligence apparatus, and a demand for faster, cheaper air travel. Our focus has improved and our willingness to pay what it costs has already brought improvement with much more on the way if we can sustain our alarm (which is to say, our determination). The question is not \"Are we safer since 9/11?\" That answer is an unequivocal \"Yes.\" The appropriate question is \"Are we safe enough?\" Hindsight is once again shown to be 20/20. In retrospect there were some valid reasons for not piecing together the likelihood of 9/11 and there were some that were not so valid. There were plenty of panels and papers providing warnings, but the broader national attitude didn't lend itself to paying heed. The sad truth is that terrorism approaches its targets like water seeking holes in a vessel. Time and our own attitudes are terrorists' allies. Determination, perseverance, and, above all, imagination are the bulwarks of our defense.Another message emerges as well: the Cold War really is over, and a new world order really is emerging. It may or may not be the one envisaged by President Bush the elder, but 9/11 is the opening campaign of the first war as captured by President Bush the younger. The nation must adapt to new and still-forming geopolitical and cultural realities if we are to prosper in the future. This is an excellent primer to prepare for that journey.",
            "Many would and do say that it is easy to see how this could happen, meaning the attacks were in fact low down and low tech, hitting us at our vulnerable spot, our freedom. The book does in fact have evidense of being put together to quickly here and there, but for the most part there is new information and up to date background info on the terrorists I did not know. The book is not just how did this happen, there is considerable info here from various trusted sources that has been upgraded from their past writes. Another book similar not only mentions &quot;how this&quot; but predicted it would happen and goes into detail, even predicting precise accounts. I strongly recommend Karl Mark Maddox, a surprising paper back titled SB 1 or God.",
            "The question that is the title of this book is one that will be pondered over for a very very long time. Obviously the 9/11 attacks had many causes from the roots of the \"jihad\" against us to the failures of security and intelligence operations. In this book, published shortly after the attacks, the editors of \"Foreign Affairs\" have gathered together a diverse group of experts on various subjects relating to the terrible events of that day and asked each to submit a short essay on their particular area of expertise. The first group concern Islam, the Middle East and the U.S. role in the region. Brian Jenkins attempts to dissect the Al Quaeda organization. Fouad Ajami, a foreign affairs thinker I greatly admire, writes about the uneasy American presence in the Middle East and its relationship to the jihad against the West. Michael Scott Doran also covers this subject from the perspective that the United States is intervening in an Islamic civil war. Karen Armstrong, an expert on Islam, briefly examines the religion's history to demonstrate how Islam has no tradition of violence and the Medieval tradition of conquest was not inspired by the Koran. It is her view that today's Islamic radicalism is a modern phenomenon. Walter Laqueur, an expert on terrorism, contributes a fascinating piece on the changing tactics of terrorists. He looks at the stark difference in scale of bloodshed between the nationalistic terrorists such as the IRA or the Basque Separatists who had at least rational goals, if not deplorable methods, and the nihilism of the Islamists. Other essays look at the history of Afghanistan, the duplicitous role played by Saudi Arabia and Sandy Berger contributes an essay on Bin Laden's phony concern for the Palestinians. The next series looks to issues of protecting the U.S. homeland. William Weschler writes about the difficulties of cutting off Al Quaeda's finances. Richard K. Betts discusses the difficulties of using counter-intelligence to thwart attacks. Gregg Easterbrook documents the pathetic airline security. Stephen Flynn demonstrates the pathetic state of homeland security on 9/11. The remaining essays deal with such diverse issues as the threat of germ warfare, and how the U.S. needs to conduct the war on terrorism. My personal favorite essay is by Michael Mandelbaum who writes about \"diplomacy in wartime.\" Mandelbaum recognizes that diplomacy is not just about the carrot but also about the stick.Due to its October 2001 publication date, some of this book seems out of date. Nevertheless, it remains valuable as a documentation of the first impressions of a number of important thinkers to the challenges that lie ahead. It does not explain \"how this happened\" nor does it set out to do so. Someday, when the smoke clears, THE book on how and why this happened will surely be written. Just as happened with the British nap of the thirties that allowed Hitler to become a mortal threat, we will eventually learn the true reason America slept for ten years while this horrendous threat got worse and worse. This book is well worth reading, however, and provides some basic insight.",
            "I have no idea how they managed to pull this together so quickly, but it's a fantastic collection of pieces by top experts on just about every conceivable aspect of the crisis--from what motivated the terrorists, to the geopolitical background of the attacks, to homeland defense problems, to what the larger significance of all this is and where things go from here. You get the sense that the authors really know what they're talking about, but it's written very accessibly too. The perfect Christmas present for anybody who can't stop watching the news...",
            "With such an indispensable question asked of this book's title, the book never reaches it to that indispensable mark. It certainly hits all around the dartboard like a late night drunk randomly firing darts in his favorite corner bar at three in the morning. But to answer a question like \"How did this happen (9/11?\" we need a stone cold sober dart champion focused and singular firing bull's eye after bull's eye.Here's what I mean, in the same book we get disparate articles on \"The Biological Threat From Abroad,\" by Richard Butler, \"What's next for U.S. Armed Forces,\" by Gen Wesley Clark, and \"American Society Responds to the New War,\" by Alan Wolfe; none of which go towards answering the question that continues to burn in the minds of free people across the world, \"How did this happen?\" or more succinctly \"Why?\"Give credit where it is due to the editors of Foreign Affairs (one of my favorite journals) for assembling such a powerhouse of national policy experts writing about the topics they know best, but to unroot the causes of Islamic extremist one book alone won't cut it. Delve much deeper than what this book has to offer. Check out some of the assembled suggested reading listmania lists here on \"Amazon.com\" and start digging in. I've read about 10 books on the subject to date and feel like I have ten more to go to scratch at some sort of understanding.What we need to here from is from inside the Maddrassas that ingrain a hatred of the West from an early age. These schools are all over Pakistan and dotted about the Middle East. If we can get at why these children are taught to hate and are hijacking a peaceful beautiful religion maybe we can get closer to answering the question, \"How did this happen?\"Read this book to hear how the leaders in their respective fields view the terrorist problem and what is to be done all from a US perspective, but don't buy into the preconception that it will answer the question published on the title.",
            "Although this book was a rush job right after the 9-11 attacks it does cover some very interesting issues and points of view. The book has essays from a number of foreign policy and terrorism experts on topics ranging from the CIA efforts in Afghanistan, the cultural environment in the Middle East, airport security, bio-weapons and the ability of the US armed forces to handle this new threat. The topics covered are very interesting and gives the reader and good overview of the different issues involved in this complicated foreign policy and security issue. The essays are also minus most of the emotion that many other books on the 9-11 attacks have. This is probably due to the topics of the essays and the limited space each author was given. The editors also did a good job of arranging the essays so that the book had a good flow and the items lead into one another.Overall my only real complaint with the book is that there were a few errors here and there, but they are due to the quick publishing date of the book and do not take away much from the points. Also reading a book with a new author per chapter you do not have a consistent writing style but the editors did a good job in that the wide range of authors is not a detriment to the flow of the book. I assumption is that the test of some was edited with a heavy hand to provide the consistent writing style. Overall the book is an interesting look at the causes of the 9-11 attacks and well worth reading.",
            "For an instant book this is a very solid piece of work, certainly the best single place to start trying to understand September 11. My major criticism is that it does not contain suggestions for further reading.",
            "As usualy, the editors of Foreign Affaris have published timely and trenchant analysis. The essays cover all aspects of 9/11, from root causes to practical concerns regarding the truly terrifying state of airline security in the United States. The essay on the sad state of port security is rather unsettling. I learned more from this collection than from the endless hours spent watching CNN and Fox News."

            "Most books and reports on Civil War events come from white writers and voice white viewpoints. This one speaks with a black voice, as George E. Stephens wrote as correspondent for the (New York) &quot;Weekly Anglo-African,&quot; from the events of John Brown's rebellion (Nov. 1859) through September, 1864. Along the way he shifted from member of the press to acting patriot-soldier, recruiting and then enlisting in the Massachusetts 54th, that leader among black regiments depicted in the movie &quot;Glory.&quot; Donald Yacovone provides not only notes for the letters but also information on Stephens' family background. After the 54th disbanded Yacovone follows Stephens' ongoing struggles to educate freed slaves in Virginia; the story of many black patriots' efforts to move their people upward by finally granting them some education is not widely told or appreciated. These chapters fill a need today. So the life taken as a whole is both glorious and tragic: it's distressing to follow Stephens' hopes, from fresh optimism through disillusionment to despair, time and time again from the events of Fort Wagner to the last anguished efforts of his life. At its end he had to sue the government he'd served all his life to obtain the commission denied to him because of his race (though illegally), and provide for his wife with a higher pension. He never lived to receive it, dying in 1888 before the promotion came through. In this Stephens is typical of black men of his time, and it's deeply saddening.This is not a happy, but it is a useful, book, and a corrective for many cheap heroics about how well we treated our black veterans. We need to ponder its message today."

            "Nine men in a rigged-out steam boiler cranked out of Breach Inlet near Mt.Pleasant, S.C. and changed naval history forever. It was not until 50 years later in 1914 that the next ship would be brought down by a submarine. This crisply written account is an excellent introduction to one of the most facinating subplots of the entire War for Southern Independence. Forced by necessity to outwit their industrial foe the South resorted to and developed many innovations to counter the vulnerability their rivers and coastline presented. Mines (then called torpedos), ironclads, floating batteries and rams were just a few. It is this writers opinion than none were so bold, desperate, courageous and far-thinking as the H.L.Hunley. It was actually the third of three built by Watson &amp; McClintock of New Orleans. Horance Hunley completely underwrote the second which sunk in Mobile Bay and contributed a third of the funds for the final sub which bore his name. Simple in its construction, unforgiving of error she claimed three crews, including her namesake before she took her place in history. Meet the men and ideas which gave her life against the backdrop of a desperate Charleston holding on against a merciless enemy. Only now in a specially designed laboratory in Charleston is she finally yielding the secrets of what happened that fateful night in Feb. 1864.",
            "The story of the CSS Hunley's successful attack on the Union Sloop-of-War, the Husatonic is both riveting military and political history. There is enough detail for you die hard sub fans, the way the comparatively primitive technology wrestled with the problems of manned undersea operations of a warship. Students of history will love the gripping and tragic descriptions of the struggle of the besieged,blockaded, and bombarded southern cities endured, making the confedaracy desparate to enough to go ahead with a daring technological leap even though the first two crews died in the testing phase of this remarkable vessel. Highly recomended.",
            "Obviosuly the author failed do even do basic reserach as the \"Hunley\" was NOT the \"CSS Hunley\" since it wasn't commissioned by the Confederacy which would've given it the title \"CSS.\" It was gift from a Confederate, Mr. H.L. Hunley, hence the simple name \"Hunley\". If he couldn't get the name right, why expect anything else to be right?"

            "This is a brilliant book which goes far toward explaining why racism still exists nearly 150 years after the end of slavery. It explains that racism does not persist because of ignorant, uneducated white people, but because the capitalist rulers of America find racism too useful and profitable to part with. To prove this thesis, Camejo goes into fascinating detail about how Radical Reconstruction began to transform the American south, as Blacks, armed with guns and the right to vote, began to direct their own destiny. He then shows how the Republican Party abandoned Blacks as the Party consolidated its economic grip on the south, and \"reconstructed\" it in their own capitalist image. His analysis of the \"Myth of the 1877 Compromise,\" which historians have mystified for so many years, is particularly helpful. Finally, Camejo does a great job of showing how and why other historians have failed to explain these truths clearly to generations of students. Don't miss this book!!!"

I learned some history from it, and was impressed by Annie's heroism and selfless service, as well as those she worked with. I think I may have kept going back to it, though, because I found the ending unsatisfactory. I still felt lost and restless, like Annie could never have real peace and a place of her own again.The characters are well portrayed, the battles and storyline are clear and easy to follow, and Annie's emotions and decisions are relateable. I appreciated the humanness of it all. The story inspired me to do more research on the Civil War and the people involved in it.",

My favorite character was Will because he is a funny character and he does different things in the book . A history reader should read this book because it might be interesting for that reader like me I like to read about history.",

It was a great book to read if you a person that likes books that make you feel happy, sad, and depressed all in a 184 page book. I defintly think that if your that sort of person then you will love the book Gentle Annie. I believe that it was a good way for me to learn about the Civil War.In this book you are led through the time line of the Civil War by a genle and loving nurse named Annie Etheridge. Annie makes friend and loses friends. She has happy moments and sad moments.I am in fifth grade and I loved this book. But I think that this would be good for all ages. Besides, what is wrong with being 100 and having some good historical fiction to read. I gave the book Gentle Annie a pretty good rating. It is even in my top 20 favorite books.

Then she joined the army, to do what she loved- be a nurse. Of the 20 girls she was recruited with, Annie as the only one left when they went to war. She braved death in the face, caring for soldiers of both armies. She worked among the blood and gunpowder and death, but never once lost her goodness. At the end of the war, she received a medal for bravery.",

            "I liked the book because of the intensity of the setting with the bloody and brutal battles. They explain how bad the wounds were on the soldiers so well that I could almost see them in my mind when I read. When she was just seventeen she was as a nurse. She was ready to serve her country. Annie is very interested in history and what is happening around the world. She was a strong, independent girl that wanted to be treated like a soldier and be in the front lines of the war. I would rate this book from a scale 1 - 10 an 8 because it leaves us hanging at the end a little. I suggest this book to 4th - 6th graders that like the Civil War.",
            "I think that the book Gentle Annie is a very good book! I like how the author explains Annie's character. I also thought that the news about Frank was very shocking! I did think the author left us hanging at the end. I like how the book is historical fiction, but it is based on a girl named Anna B. Etheridge. I think this book on a 1 to 10 scale would be an 8. There are more settings in this book, but the main setting is in Alexandria, Virginia. Annie reminds me of Clara Barton because she was a civil war nurse for the union, and so is Annie. I think this book is good for people who love reading about the Civil War. I also think that this book is good for teachers. If teachers want an interesting book to share with their class this is the right book. This book might be a little hard for some students. I like this book for 2 reasons. First, I love reading! Second, I am very interested in civil war books. When Annie was with the troops she was happy. She always marched in the front line with the soldiers. When a soldier was wounded or died she always cried. I wonder if there are anymore biographies about Anna B. Etheridge. I would really like to read more about her!THIS BOOK IS COOL!",
            "Someone should read this book because it is exciting and a fun adventure. Someone should not read this book if they don't like adventures and excitement in a story.This book was a pretty good book that is why I rated it a 4.It was not an awesome book because it got boring and I wanted to put it down at times, but I did not because I was determined to get done and finish the book so I kept on reading. If you are a reader who likes action and people who die then you should read this book. My favorite part was when Annie went in to battle being brave. My favorite character was Annie because she was so brave and determined.",
            "If you're into war stories and are looking for a differnt view, try this one, the story puts you into the front line of battles and introduces you to real live characters like Abe Lincoln, and the spy who was truly a women Sarah Emma Edmonds. The story takes you to lots of major battles,and shows you the horrors of the Civil War",
            "This book is really great. I think that what Annie did was so courageous and selfless. days and years she threw herself into the battlefields to nurse wounded soldiers. she deserves the medal of honor. what strikes me though is that she is a true story who really did exist. I will say one thing, and that is that i wasn't really interested in that kind of thing before, like the fictional civil war stories and such. but since i read, 'annie' i have been and now i'm even working on a book like that, too. it's called, &quot;Promises: A Civil War Tale, great book...kudos to the author of &quot;Annie&quot;",

The setting is Detroit Michigan, but then Annie was told she was moving to Milwaukee Wisconsin with her dad. When she was 16 she moved back to Detroit Michigan to join the Michigan army. When she gets there she goes through boot camp and trains to be a nurse for the Union Army. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading historical fiction stories, someone who enjoys reading stories about the past, and anyone who enjoys reading as much as I do!",
            "I'm reading this book in my class for lit. circles and so far I think it is good.The part I don't like about it is that it is bloody.But, Annie is really interesting and determined to be a good nurse.She is very brave!There are some sad parts, though.Good for 4th grade and up."

It took congress twenty years to finally allocate funds to all have all official documents and battlefield communications assembled and sorted through. Americans could at last have an inside look at who actually said or did what, and when.While that massive project was still underway, the publisher of this series persuaded highly qualified people - most of them participants -- to produce a quick readable history in light of the new information.

These reports, both National and Confederate, will appear in the series of volumes Military Reports now in preparation [by] the War Records office in the War Department.\"Alexander Webb (\"The Peninsula\") adds \"To be of any practical use, all history, and particularly military history, must be gradually sifted and reduced to small compass.\"Jacob D. Cox (\"The March to the Sea - Franklin & Nashville\") sums up purpose and limitations: \"The class of readers which has been most in mind [includes] includes the surviving officers and men who served in the war. [My] aim has been to supplement their personal knowledge by the facts ... of recent research. To give unity and symmetry to the ... campaigns here told, by examining each in the light of the plans and purposes of the leaders on both sides. The limits assigned... made it necessary to choose between the narration of incidents which would enliven the story, and that fullness to strictly military detail which seemed necessary to make the several campaigns clearly intelligible, and to enable the reader to judge, with some degree of satisfaction, the character of the operations. ...the effort to do so will give to each a broader understanding of what the great game of war really is.\"This is what these short works accomplish in spades. With good maps at hand, the text is easily followed, often with amazement at the sorts of things that can and do routinely occur on campaign and in battle. We see armies so pestered by the random and unforeseen that one wonders how anything is accomplished.But the above assumes good maps - and here the books fall short.Cox: \"The maps ... are reduced copies of the official surveys made by the engineers of the army. ... In reducing them it has not been possible to preserve all the details of the original... The reader is presumed to make reference to an ordinary hand-atlas... To have illustrated the text by larger and more elaborate maps would have thwarted the purpose of the publishers to put the series within the reach of all.\"You do need more detailed maps that supplied in most popular military atlases. There are several solutions. If the maps in a particular volume are printed clearly, they can be enlarged on a Xerox machine. Alternately, simply google under Images for, say, \"Wilderness, 1864\" and you'll likely find an amazing variety of choices to print out.Back in the 1880s, the full sized official government maps were available in a large folder. These were photo reduced to a still legible size, and presented in color, in an 1891 oversized book titled \"The Official Military Atlas of the Civil War.\"B&N; reprinted this book in 2004, photo-reduced 10% (to 13 x 16 \"). You can get a used copy on Amazon for $20.00. The only odd thing is that all maps are placed completely randomly, apparently whatever will fit where. You have to consult the appropriate index, which will list all plates (facing pages) containing a relevant map.* * *To give a sense of the value of these books, (1) I've posted some of my personal maps from these books. When a caption isn't attributed, it's mine, warts and all.(2) You find remarkable eyewitness observations such as this in Palfrey's \"The Antietem and Fredericksburg.\" The Union having been defeated at 2nd Manassas must move to block Lee's attempt to cross into Maryland or Pennsylvania. The fastest way for these haggard troops to do so is to march back through Washington and then west.\"Washington and its environs presented singular sights in the early days of September, 1862. The luxury and refinements of peace contrasted sharply with the privations and squalor of war. There are few prettier suburban drives than those in the neighborhood of Washington, and no weather is more delightful than that of late evening there, when a cooler air comes with shortening days. As the shadows lengthened in the golden afternoon, well-appointed carriages rolled along those charming drives, and by their side the ragged, dusty, sunburnt regiments from Pennsylvania trudged along. Rest, cleanliness, ice, food, drink, every indulgence of civilized life were within reach, but our hands could not be stretched to grasp them. ... The carriages returned to their stables, the fair ladies returned to the enjoyment of every pleasure that Washington could confer, but the Army of the Potomac moved steadily northward to bivouac under the stars or the clouds, and to march again in its tatters through the dust and the sunshine, through the rain and the mud.\"(3) The actual communications among commanders is fascinating.(4) Basically working through these books with maps is a quick read, but also has the fascination of working through a book of logic problems. The essential information available to commanders is in your hands also. What to do is not always clear, but I came to admire the ability of most generals to \"let a situation develop,\" then \"read\" it, and take actions.The complete set:(1) The Outbreak of Rebellion - John G. Nicolay(2) From Fort Henry to Corinth - M.F. Force(3) The Peninsula - Francis Winthrope Palfrey(4) The Army under Pope - John Goodman Ropes(5) The Antietam & Fredericksburg(6) Chancellorsville & Gettysburg - Abner Doubleday(7) The Army of the Cumberland - Henry M. Cist(8) The Mississippi - Francis Vinton Greene(9) Atlanta - Jacob D. Cox(10) March to the Sea & Franklin/Nashville - Jacob D. Cox(11) The Shenandoah Valley in 1864 - George E. Pond(12) Virginia Campaign of '64 & '65 - Andrew A HumphreysThere is also a volume of statistical records (V. 13), and three on the naval war:The Blockade and the Cruisers - James Russell SoleyThe Atlantic Coast - Daniel AmmenThe Gulf and Inland Waters - A.T. Mahan (yes, the Mahan)I suggest reading the land volumes as follows:I. The Outbreak of Rebellion.From here you can follow either East or West Theatre first:IIA - Eastern Theatre(3) The Peninsula - after the failure of Bull Run, and attempt is made to capture Richmond by a naval landing.(4) The Army under Pope; while Union troops are evacuating from the failed peninsula effort, Lee turns on Pope and inflicts another defeat at 2nd Bull Run. Lee then attempts to cross the Potomac and invade the north.(5) The Antietam & Fredericksburg; McClellen having returned from the peninsula stops Lee's invasion at Antietam but fails to destroy his army. Burnside takes over and pursues Lee to Fredericksburg, where the Union army self-destructs in an assault on its fortified heights.(6) Chancellorsville & Gettysburg - Hooker replaces Burnside and tries to take the Union army around Fredericksburg, but is bluffed from the dense forests around Chancellorsville. Lee again breaks free and this time invades Pennsylvania but is stopped at Gettysburg.(11) The Shenandoah Valley in 1864; this valley is a thorn in the Union's flank, and is ultimately razed so Union forces can operate more freely in the east.(12) Virginia Campaign of '64 & '65; Lincoln is desperate to end the war. Grant promises to do so at a price. It will be bloody, but he wants all losses immediately replaced to his army remains at full strength during the long bloody grind to Richmond.IIB- Western Theatre(2) From Fort Henry to Corinth; The Confederacy hoped to fortify the upper Mississippi in Missouri and Kentucky as a jumping off point to invade the north. Grant wrests the initiative, and with the fall of Forts Henry and Donelson. After Grant's decisive victory at Shiloh, the Union never loses the initiative in the west.(8) The Mississippi; the struggle for Vicksburg, which puts the entire Mississippi in Union hands.(7) The Army of the Cumberland; the struggle for Chattanooga; Union defeat at Chickamauga, besieged at Chattanooga, final breakout of the siege.(9) Atlanta; Union drive down the critical rail line through hard country from Chattanooga to Atlanta.(10) March to the Sea & Franklin/Nashville; after Atlanta, Sherman's famed march to the sea, after which he very nearly links up with Grant driving down on Petersburg.CAUTION:This series is public domain. Many publishers offer cheap digital scans with illegible maps and text that is difficult to read -- apparently this reviews stepped on one such land mine.The best editions by far are those from DSI digital scans, with flawless text and clear maps. Most of the have the \"Look Inside\" feature so you can see for yourself.For some unfortunate reason, DSI's editions usually don't appear when you search these titles. Try searching a title with DSI after the name, but even that doesn't always work. Here is the DSI edition:[...]The Da Capo edition is also good. It's editions are a little smaller in size but of high quality and with excellent contemporary introductions.Final comment - I'm no expert or professional Civil War buff, so don't treat anything I've written as such. This is merely a reader who has derived great personal pleasure from this series. I've tried to convey a sense of what was so enjoyable to me."

            "The Shenandoah, by Julia Davis, is a brief history of the Virginia's Shenandoah Valley. It covers prehistory through the 1940s (my edition has a 1945 copyright date) and places particular emphasis on the Civil War, the only time when the Valley was a significant stage for historical events. The author's approach is both personal and anecdotal. She brings the main characters vividly to life by means of direct quotes and descriptions of their every day activities: George Washington who surveyed and lived in Fredrick County as a young man, Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson whose Valley Campaign was a brilliant use of maneuver by an inferior force and who taught a Sunday School for black children that he called \"My Militia\", and Robert E. Lee the Confederate Commander of the Army of Northern Virginia who became and President of Washington College (now Washington and Lee University). They are complemented by a host of minor actors including Jackson's dashing cavalry commander Turner Ashby who sat with his wounded horse until it died, the colorful Confederate spy Belle Boyd who smuggled information on Union troop locations through the lines in her petticoats, cartographer Jedediah Hotchkiss who facilitated Jackson's campaign of maneuver, cavalry officer Major Edward McDonald who was shot through the throat just prior to Lee's surrender at Appomattox, Jackson's staff officers Sandy Pendleton, whose descendant I met in 2003 while visiting Jackson's headquarters in Winchester, and Henry Kyd Douglas, whose family estate across the Potomac from Shepherdstown is now run by the Park Service, and many, many more.I first read this book during a high school summer vacation and became fascinated with the Valley and Stonewall Jackson. It appeared to me that it was a tale told by a lady who grew up there and learned its history by word of mouth from some of the actual participants. In particular, she drew on Henry Kyd Douglas' personal history, I Rode with Stonewall, which is still in print.I recently learned a bit more which completes my picture of Julia Davis: She was born in the Shenandoah Valley (in Charles Town, WV) in 1900, the daughter of John Davis, the unsuccessful Democratic candidate for president who later served as ambassador to London. Her mother died as a result of her birth, and her two sets of grandparents played major roles in raising her. Major Edward McDonald was her maternal grandfather and undoubtedly an early source of her knowledge of Civil War history. In addition to history, she wrote a number of historical novels. Her most recent publication is an abridged version of The Shenandoah, entitled Shenandoah: Daughter of the Stars, which is supplemented by photographs by Lucian Niemeyer. Julia died in 1992 in a manner as graceful as her prose: At a banquet, at age 92, she asked a friend to dance with her. As they left the dance floor, she said, \"Thank you, Don\", appeared to trip over a rug, fell, and died in her friend's arms.
