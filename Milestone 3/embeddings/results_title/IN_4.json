        "description": "The American Civil War (1861-65) was the bloodiest war of the nineteenth century and its impact continues to be felt today. It, and its origins have been studied more intensively than any other period in American history, yet it remains profoundly controversial. Brian Holden Reid's formidable volume is a major contribution to this ongoing historical debate. Based on a wealth of primary research, it examines every aspect of the origins of the conflict and addresses key questions such as was it an avoidable tragedy, or a necessary catharsis for a divided nation? How far was slavery the central issue? Why should the conflict have errupted into violence and why did it not escalate into world war?",

It was a war defined by savage brutality, untold human costs, and monumental political crises that left the literal and social landscape of the nation forever changed. One hundred fifty years later, it continues to hold a powerful grip on the American psyche. In A Short History of the Civil War, noted historian James L. Stokesbury dramatically and concisely chronicles the important events leading up to the war and, using maps, recounts its decisive battles while describing the strategies and tactics of the North\u2019s and South\u2019s prominent commanders. Drawing on fascinating details and little-known facts, Stokesbury also brings to life the generals\u2014Grant, Lee, Hooker, McClellan, Jackson\u2014and the unsung heroes of this great struggle between the Union and the Confederacy.",

            "This is a nice introduction to Civil War history. The author does not take sides which is refreshing since a bias is often evident in Civil war books. Between narratives of movements and battles are several short essays about the cause of the war, the economies of the respective nations, and analysis of military doctrine of the period.The author does a bit of analysis of the key characters and its interesting to see a foreigner's take on the war (Stokesbury is Canadian). One criticism is that the battle descriptions are so short that it is easy to get confused about what took place in the action, and whole complex campaigns can be glossed over. To be fair, this is difficult to avoid in a &quot;short&quot; history of such a protracted war.The writing is good and some of it stands out (the last paragraph of the book gave me goosebumps). This is a good primer on the Civil war and is recommended.",
            "I bought this book for a nice summary, but not too detailed summary of the Civil War....and thats exactly what I got. Professor Stokesbury writes this wonderful, well researched book on one the most key points in our history. After reading this book I have a new outlook on how close we were to becoming two nations. Each key battle is cleary and methodically discussed, along with some of the stuff outside the battlelines. He is very objective, not favoring either side, and explains the causes of the start and the final collapse of the Confederacy. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a quick, easy-read summary of the Civil War, or to a history buff.",
            "James L. Stokesbury was a professor of history at Acadia University in Nova Scotia, Canada. He has written numerous short histories of some of the most important wars of the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries.In this book on the Civil War, Stokesbury takes a vast amount of information (over 50,000 books have been published on the subject) and condenses it into a slim book of just over 300 pages. He covers the broad horizon of this period in a meaningful and entertaining way. Of course, sacrifices must be made. Some of the battle narratives are confusing in their shortened form, but the ebb and flow of the campaigns are accurately portrayed.Stokesbury's account is remarkably objective generally; however, every Civil War buff has his own opinions about the best and worst of the generals. Stokesbury makes no attempt to hide his feelings about his candidates for the worst.Many of the trivial details a typical soldier's life are incorporated in the narrative. Also covered are some of the economic, social, and political events which shaped the course of the war.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to know more about this pivotal point in our history but doesn't have the time to commit to some of the larger tomes.",
            "There are a number of one volume histories dealing with the American Civil War, but this is one of the best I've read. It consists of about 330 pages of narrative published in a very readable text design. Within this limited amount of space the author does an admirable job of covering such a sprawling topic. Descriptions of the major military campaigns are balanced with sections explaining changes that occurred in the political, economic, and social landscape. The often neglected war in the western portion of the Confederacy is well-covered. Although the historical personages who cross this bloody stage must be rendered in brief strokes, they are handled deftly enough so one gets some feeling for their characters and their roles. Author James L. Stokesbury dispenses personal observations that are at some points droll and at others fully reflective of the tragedy of the war. Certainly there are aspects of mid-19th Century American life not given full scrutiny, including slavery itself. But this is, after all, a self-described short history. I would strongly recommend \"A Short History of the Civil War\" as an introductory text for casual readers and students. I'd further suggest that even more serious minded researchers can benefit from reading what I find to be a model of concise, balanced, yet compelling historical narrative.",
            "I blundered on this book in the stacks at the local library. After an introduction to the civil war via the Shaara novels, my wife and I have been reading some histories of specific battles and some biographies of individual leaders. We felt the need for a general survey of the war to tie it all together, but we did not want to devote the time to a comprehensive history. This book filled the bill perfectly.Stokesbury has an extremely fluid and readable prose style that is simply a joy to read. I assume that his facts are reasonably accurate. To me, he seems to devote just the right amount of attention to the various battles, individuals, issues, etc., though he leaves enough unsaid to stimulate further reading. He certainly does have his opinions, which he expresses sometimes with a delightful sarcasm. And he imparts some of the flavor of what it must have felt like to fight or have a loved one fighting in this war, which literally tore America apart in more ways than one. Tears came to my eyes as I read the details of the surrender at Appomattox, a testament both to the extreme emotions of the war, even after more than a century, and to Stokesbury's narrative powers.The only real weak point of the book for me was the maps, which are not cited in the text and do little to assist the reader in visualizing troop deployments, battle maneuvers, etc.",

But overall it's a great start and introduces a great many ideas, names and places to get you to a good starting spot if you have interest in going further into detail about a certain aspect, place or important figure in the Civil War.

Texas was settled not for the perpetuation of slavery, but due to the Mexican government knew its people would never settle the area of Texas, and thus opened it to Anglos to do so. Texans fought Indians, built the area into an agricultural success, and developed trade with America. Then the Mexican government wanted to transplant it's own people to take it over. Texas entered the Union as an understood Slave State, then the U. S. Government declared war on Texas for being such.

Speaking as one who always wanted to give more time to this epoch but did not know where to go next, this covered the battles, the people, and the country before and during the war.

Key figures, battles and social phenomena are explained in language that a novice can understand (after reading it, you'll finally know what a &quot;flanking maneuver&quot; is). He also approaches the topic with a touch of humor (his list of &quot;ways to be a successfull re-enactor&quot; is required reading as much for re-enactors as for those of us who question the sanity of wearing a wool tunic on a July afternoon). For those who've already earned their stripes as a &quot;buff&quot; this book is still essential reading. A fellow buff of mine and I have already had many lively debates about Flagel's ranking of the best and worst generals--George McClellan the second worst general in the war? Flagel makes his case, and whether you agree, disagree, or wish to drop a twelve-pounder on his toe, it gets the juices flowing.",

If you're already knowledgeable about the Civil War, except for the occasional list, most of the stuff you've covered already, or already read, or was already familiar with. I enjoyed the lists of best books, best movies, and best and worst generals, but I learned nothing new from this book.",

            "There have been more books written about the Civil War -- or the War Between the States, or the Rebellion, or the War for Southern Independence, whichever you prefer -- than about any event in U.S. history. It's both a key subject for academic historians and a point of fascination for amateur readers of history. That being the case, it's difficult to come up with an entirely new approach, but Flagel comes close. He's one of the academics but also obviously a \"buff,\" and he takes the approach here of collecting more than thirty \"Ten Best\" and \"Ten Worst\" lists about all aspects of the War and its preliminaries and aftermath. The result is a large number of short, often anecdotal, well-written articles and sketches which the reader will have difficulty putting down. The \"Top Ten Surgical Tools and Medicines,\" for instance, will take you into discussions of mercury poisoning, the fact that the Confederate Army ran its own distilleries, and the procedure of amputation. The \"Ten Most Significant Battles\" are selected in terms of their consequences, and while any list like this one will start arguments, Flagel does a good job of defending his choices. Nor does he restrict himself to the military side of the War; the \"Top Ten Acts of Government\" allows him to show the relevance of the Homestead Act, Lincoln's suspension of habeus corpus, the Emancipation Proclamation, and the Thirteenth Amendment. Small factoids are scattered throughout and nearly every statement or assertion is sourced -- though mostly to other secondary sources. This is exactly the sort of book that is likely to have you jotting down subjects and books for further perusal.",

An excellent introductory guide and consultation reference for readers of all backgrounds, The History Buff's Guide To The Civil War is a welcome addition to personal, school, and community library Civil War Studies reference collections.",

This is an easy read and a good quick reference. I did not learn anything new nor did I encounter any new analyses or theories about the war. My favorite lists were the 'top ten best and worst generals'. I was surprised to see Hood listed as one of the top ten worst generals. My guess is this book will be very popular for those who just want a quick review of the civil war.If you want an excellent and a meatier introduction to the Civil War I would go with McPherson's \"Battle Cry Freedom\".",

As has been pointed out by other reviewers, this work stays pretty neutral on even political sensitive subjects, even slavery in the south and the near slavery in the north manifested in the northern factories. There are of course thousands of books out there on the Civil War, some good, some not so good. For a good quick overview though, I do not think you could go wrong with this one and I highly recommend it.

            "The Civil War by Robert Paul Jordan is a GREAT book about the Civil War. It guides you through the prelude to the Civil War and all 4 years of the grueling war we know so well. An amazing collection of Civil War paintings and pictures only enrich your experience. It includes drawn maps of the major battlefields and what happened on them. Also it includes pictures of what these places look like today, allowing you to visualize what they used to look like. Overall this is the source of information for Civil War veterans and to newbies as well.",

What we fail to learn from the past is destined to be repeated in the future, as we are seeing even now. It is a good book. I recommend it.",
            "National Geographic has great pictures and this book produced by the Society is no different. The book is a short summary of the war between the states. The author is very neutral in his historical summary, trying to not offend any Southerner. The writing is concise and neatly summarizes the war. I actually learned something even though I have read dozens of books about this war. The book is divided by years, and includes a prelude.The war's battles are detailed with battlefield maps. This was a nicely done book.As I said, the one thing that is lacking is the author's neutrality. This is disconcerting, especially when the author describes the institution of slavery. Slavery was wrong, and the author should have stated it so. I guess he didn't want to offend the Southern population. Everything else about the book was great."

            "I purchased this book as a \"newly ordained\" Civil War buff, but I'm incredibly disappointed with it's obvious Northern bias. For example, the author gives statistics on Northern information, but then claims that Southern statistics are unavailable, or missing, or, I suppose, lost to history, which is utter nonsense. The battles are mostly referred to by their Northern names (ex. Bull Run for Manassas), which as a Southerner (I was born in Va, moved back here in 2004, and was raised in Alabama) I find mildly offensive. Yes, I know that the North \"won\" the War, but I would have liked a more balanced description and explanation of things. Two thumbs WAY down. Yankee propaganda.",

            "A surprisingly robust summary of the main elements of the Civil War, the book begins with the causes of the war: They were multiple (not a single cause), involving, among others, industrial competition between the North and South, slavery, Western expansion and states rights. In various ways these issues had been simmering for the better part of a decade and all came together in a perfect storm with the 1860 election of Abraham Lincoln.And then the book discusses the key economic and political issues: With \"king cotton\" ruling the global economy as oil does today, the South (doing so, completely on the backs of its black slaves), had begun to flex its economic muscles well beyond its region -- as it provided about 75% of the $1 billion dollar annual world cotton market. Yet, its very success, through its rural-ness and dependence on slavery, became its Achilles heel as both were the main reasons the South lacked the industrial might of the North and was unprepared to fight a war. Plus, of the 9.5 million southerners, half were black and could not be relied upon during times of war. The North on the other hand saw a rapid expansion in immigration around 1850, and thus had large reserves of both manpower and war critical raw materials, 90% of the nation's rail lines, and about two and a half times the war aged population of the South.The narrative then moves from issues to people giving more than just a thumbnail sketch of the key players; their bios, covers the Lincoln-Douglas debates, both of Lincoln terms as President and his assassination. It discusses the pivotal role of the Border States, the process of secession, and European reactions to the establishment of the CSA.Finally, it covers the major battles of the war, the weapons used, its horrors both on the front and back home, and the chronicling the history of the war. Altogether this is a veritable Civil War feast. Four Stars",

            "I'm a little surprised by the effusive reviews. It's OK -- what's a little unique is that it's organized by topic rather than chronology -- for example: weapons, battles, heroes, family life, etc. -- so you can pick up some interesting facts/perspectives. A \"hard core\" historian probably won't find much here -- pretty basic. I think either the \"for dummies\" or \"complete idiot\" book is probably a better intro."

            "It seems that much more attention is paid to debating the causes of the Civil War, but as this slim volume of essays reveals there are any number of varying and subtle arguments for explaining the outcome of the Civil War.It is probably the common view that the North winning the Civil War was inevitable, that the overwhelming preponderance of the North in terms of supplies, industrial infrastructure, and manpower ensured victory. Only one of these authors somewhat accepts the thesis of Northern material superiority. These authors are far more mindful of the fact that mismanagement or deep-seated flaws within the losing side of a conflict can be larger factors in the ultimate outcome than positive actions by the winning side.The authors all note some inherent advantages of the South: a need to only defend territory, the vastness of the South, a transportation network, the ability to produce large quantities of foodstuffs, a commodity, cotton, of great value in the international market, a huge labor force of three million slaves, and a certain psychological advantage in the defense of a way of life.But these authors discuss any number of factors that led, not necessarily inevitably, to the defeat of the South. The authors point mostly to both military and political malfeasance, as well as personalities and inherent characteristics of Southern society, as leading to defeat. The manner of financing of the War produced tremendous inflation; the supplies of cotton were mismanaged both as a source of revenue to fund the war effort and as a tool to force European nations to recognize the Confederacy; food supplies were confiscated at below market prices; and manpower was poorly utilized both in recruitment to the Southern army and in the deployment of labor on Southern farms.The states rights and independent political stance of Southerners seemed to prevent a coherent national posture being formulated in winning the Civil War. One of the authors points to the anti-statist views of all Southerners as interfering with producing a disciplined army. Southern units elected their superior officers and were disinclined to follow orders with which they disagreed. In contrast to this aggressive independence, some of the authors point to a general weakening of the Southern psychological state and even a &quot;loss of nerve.&quot; The Confederate President, Jefferson Davis, is viewed by one author as a huge factor in the defeat of the South. Davis incompetently micromanaged the war effort, pursued flawed economic strategies, was personally difficult to engage, and exhibited an ineffectual indecisiveness and conservatism in times needing forceful and visionary actions. But the one-party system in the South prevented the rise of an effective opposition that could have addressed the original poor choice of President.Beyond any material advantage, the authors generally contend that Lincoln and Grant were trump cards for the North. Both were better suited to their jobs both in temperament and competency than anyone in the South. Some would almost suggest that Lincoln and Grant being on the Southern side could have reversed the result.This book was reissued in 1996 after first appearing in 1960, but it is as readable and relevant as anything being written today. There is some overlap in the material covered in the essays, but the ideas are interesting and challenging. You won't see all of these ideas in a general book on the Civil War.",
            "This is a slim book (approximately 124 pages) that contains essays by different writers who each examine a major factor that contributed to the South losing the Civil War. Although in hindsight it appears that the South was doomed to lose, in reality, it was a close contest that literally could have been won by either side. Although the North had significant material advantages, the authors point out internal factors and decisions made (or not made) by the South that contributed greatly to it's eventual defeat. This book, although originally published nearly 50 years ago, remains surprisingly relevant and thought-provoking today.As an interesting aside, the forward to the book was written by retired Major General U. S. Grant III, the grandson of Union General (and later President) U. S. Grant.",
            "Half a century ago some of the nation's leading Civil War era historians put together this collection of essays seeking to explain, from a variety of perspectives (economic, military, political, diplomatic), why the North prevailed in the epic contest of wills between the states. We have arrived at the sesquicentennial of the great conflict and yet the insights and arguments found in \"Why the North Won the Civil War\" have lost little of their cogency.Many could (and have) argue that the southern cause was doomed from the start. Richard Current makes this conventional case in his contribution \"God and the Strongest Battalions.\" In short, he maintains that northern victory was practically guaranteed owing to the Union's insuperable advantages in manpower (2.5 times the south), capital (4 times larger), and industrial output (an order of magnitude greater), among other areas of comparative strength. Sure the Confederacy made mistakes, Jefferson Davis and Treasury Secretary Christopher Memminger could have crafted better policies, but the ability to overcome the South's economic handicaps went far beyond the power of any man or group of men, Current (and many others) argue.But is that a fair and complete view of the comparative strengths and weaknesses of the competing sides? Did not the American colonists and Vietnamese communists face longer odds in their improbable quests for independence? Did not the Confederacy hold the advantage of interior lines, a long and difficult to blockade coastline, some of the best military officers of the war, a three-million strong involuntary labor pool (i.e. slaves), great natural defenses, and the strategic advantage of being able to win simply by not losing? If neither northern victory nor southern defeat were foreordained, then how to explain the defeat?The essays by T. Harry Williams and David M. Potter reviewing military strategy and the political leadership of Jefferson Davis, respectively, are learned and forcefully argued, but hardly make a convincing monocausal explanation for the South's defeat. Nevertheless, Williams' essay in particular is a gem and recommended to any student of nineteenth century military history. He stresses that Jominian thinking was dominant among the West Point trained officers on both sides of the conflict and it is no accident that two of the three great generals in the war (Lee, Grant and Sherman by his calculation) were northerners who eschewed the Napoleonic concept, Grant even claimed that he had never read Jomini. Rather, the North's two leading commanders embraced a more Clausewitzean approach of total war, seeking the destruction of the main enemy army wherever it may be found through withering preponderance of force, not a victory of maneuver through superior planning and the capture of critical physical locations as dictated by Jomini.The most convincing essay, I found, was the largely contrarian contribution by David Herbert Donald, \"Died of Democracy,\" which argues ironically that the true weakness of the Confederacy was an unwavering commitment to democracy and individualism. He compares and contrasts the democratic/libertarian South to the often dictatorial North. For example, the South continued to elect non-commissioned officers and junior officers throughout the war and many men and entire units refused orders they disagreed with or simply didn't find personally satisfying. The North, on the other hand, had mostly cooperative, professional troops, especially the large percentage that were recent European immigrants and freed slaves. The South retained freedom of the press throughout the war and only briefly and locally suspended habeas corpus three times. In contrast, over 300 northern newspapers were shut down during the war and Lincoln suspended habeas corpus throughout the Union. The South claimed to be fighting for \"states rights\" and individual states that made up the Confederacy were just as jealous of their local prerogatives under the new southern form of government as they were under the Union, Donald maintains. It was this dynamic - the North, acting like a pack of dogs in their fight against the South, acting like a group of feral cats - that was the ultimate cause of Union victory and Confederate defeat, and its a theme that Potter further develops in his essay, showing how a collection of fiercely independent states with no two-party system could effectively develop a national policy on how to best leverage the power of \"King Cotton\" or raise revenue for the war effort through some form of national taxation or allocate the use of the captive slave population to fight the war. All of these potential war power policies were neglected in the face of state and individual property rights that made up the intellectual foundation of secession in the eyes of the South's political leadership.All told, this is a nice complement to any Civil War library.",
            "I was required to read this for a military history class, and as usual the professor chose a great read. Some people said it was hard to read & identify the theses of the essays due to the length, but I didn't find it a hard read & the arguments are fairly easy to identify since they cover different topics: the 1st essay being an overview & the remaining 5 covering the social, economic, political, military, and diplomatic aspects of the conflict.Despite somewhat hard read, most found it enjoyable. The writing is simple enough for non-historians to understand while providing historical analyses. Great read if you want various perspectives on why the war had the outcome it did.",
            "Many books have been written on why the South lost the Civil War or why the North won. Donald's book offers a fresh approach and the most concise expression of the author's views which are bou to make for argument and thoughtful reflection.",
            "This is an excellent book which contains six essays on the various economic, miliary, diplomatic, social, and politiical reasons why the Confederacy lost and the Union won the Civil War. This book saved my butt",
            "Includes a Foreward by U. S. Grant III, retired Major General! That, and the 8-page \"For Further Reading\" chapter, alone, are worth the price of this book!I give this book five-stars for being thought-provoking on the general subject of reasons for a military victory ending in 1865, but it is only part of the story.For the rest of the story, be sure also to read such books as __The South Was Right__ by the Kennedy brothers, and of course __General Lee's Papers__ and Jefferson Davis' own __The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government__. These latter two men were both active participants in the great drama -- there in person as eyewitness accounts -- and also give their reasons in answer to the same question of why the North won.",
            "This is a short book consisting of five lectures. The civil war does not represent a subject of great interest to me. Americans, killing Americans is basically depressing. This book, though, I find fascinating. It is a concise examination of how organizations, the military, people, governments work. If you are a student of human nature, you will enjoy it. I continue to pick the book up, and will open to any page and reread passages that stimulate thought. For a civil war \"buff\", it will place you in deep waters illuminating why things turned out the way they did.",
            "I have used this space over the past couple of years to commemorate many events important in working class history, leftist history and just plain democratic history (hey, that is our heritage too). My idea, as explained in my profile, is to try to transmit to the younger generation of leftist militants a sense of the rich, if many times negative, history of our movement. With that in mind, I have noticed recently that while I have spilled a certain amount of justifiable ink on honoring John Brown and his band at Harper's Ferry and on the personage of Abraham Lincoln, also justifiable, I have not spent nearly enough time on some of the other great issues of the Civil War period itself. I begin to rectify that error here. And it is an error. A lot of what the United States have become in the world, for good or evil, stems from the events of that period.Some of the books that I review in this space as I introduce subjects that I think will be of interest are those that first got me interested in the subject. Thus, the books tend to have older copyright dates and, in many cases, have been superseded by more recent (and generally, better) work on the subject. But I still see value in them as a starting point. That is the case here. I distinctly remember, after having gone through the basics of the American Civil War in my high school history class, going out to buy this book in order to better understand the question posed by the title of this book- why did the North win the Civil War? Although this book does not directly address some of the reasons that I would give now for why the North succeeded it nevertheless gave some, to me, provocative thoughts about the issues then.This short book is a result of a conference held in the late 1950's at Gettysburg, in preparation for celebrating the Civil War Centennial, which discussed various historical points of view as to the basis for the Northern victory. Now there have been innumerable books on every conceivable aspect of the Civil War, from songs to sewing, so by this year 2008 so it is hard to say that this book sticks out. However this book represented the best thinking of the last generation of Civil War scholars on the general trends of the times. The subjects delved into-Northern and Southern economics, generalmanship, diplomacy, effects of war- weariness, Southern character defects have all been expanded on since. But here is a place to start an outline of the subject. This book also helps to understand one of the positive consequences of the Northern victory-the consolidation of a unitary trans-continental state. Of course, readers, let us keep our eyes on the prize- the real import of studying about the Civil War is to see how the great social issue of that day-the abolition of slavery got fought out to the finish. For that we need to look elsewhere.",
            "The book is good for anyone who wants a quick understanding of certain possibilities of why the North won. However, some of the essays(this is no reflection of the actual book) are not that well justified in my opinion."

            "James Ford Rhodes (May 1st, 1848 - January 22nd, 1927) was both an industrialist and an historian. Prior to this work, he produced seven volumes of a \"History of the United States from the Compromise of 1850\" (an eighth volume was published after this work), and he also produced a three volume \"History of the Civil War 1861-1865\". In the preface to this one-volume \"History of the Civil War 1861-1865\" he states that this is not an \"abridgement\" of his prior work, but rather was a \"fresh\" study.Originally published by \"The MacMillan Company\" in 1917, this new History was awarded the 2nd Pulitzer Prize for History in 1918. Rhodes became known for his detailed research and lack of bias which is consistent throughout all his history works. His balanced treatment of both sides is a rather stark contrast to the first winner of the Pulitzer Prize in History (Jean Jules Jusserand's \"With Americans of Past and Present Days\") which was more of a celebration of Franco-American relations.It is interesting while reading this book to think about the way the perceptions of the United States Civil War have changed over the years. As an example, Rhodes has no difficulty in emphasizing slavery and anti-slavery as the primary causes of the war, and since that time it has become more common to see more general references to state rights used, perhaps to cover the ugliness of issue. Another example would be the way History and Historians treat Robert E. Lee. Rhodes has high praise for Lee, though that is not to say that he doesn't point out his mistakes. Lee does not seem to fare so well with modern historians.The discussion of other nation's attitudes towards the war is one of the more interesting sections, at least for me. Though ultimately there was no foreign interference, it is interesting to learn how a different outcome in a battle here and there, could easily have changed things considerably. One also gets a slightly different view on the French position towards the Union than one did from the essay from Jusserand's work, though to be fair the prior work was more focused on their attitude towards slavery and Abraham Lincoln, and not as much on the war and its negative effects on France.Other interesting chapters and threads throughout the book include looking at how the North responded to the draft, especially after it became clear that the war would be won. There is a discussion of the politics and the Democratic Party turning into the Copperheads, while some legitimate opposition positions were lost as a result of the party pushing their opposition to Lincoln and the war. Rhodes also discusses the technology, and the failure to quickly move to breech loading rifles.His discussion of the economics during the war is also very thorough. Obviously there is a discussion on the blockades and blockade running. In addition he discusses the currency problems faced both in North and South, as well as the debt resulting from the war and the consequences to the populations of the Union and the Confederacy. He also looks at the illegal trade between North and South during the war.Not surprisingly, Rhodes gives an excellent and thorough evaluation of the Generals and other figures on each side of the war. In particular, his comparison of the Generals as they come into opposition with each other is particularly well done. While the perception of some of them as changed through time, one can count on an even appraisal in all cases. The same is true for his evaluation of the battles, tactics, and strategies from the perspective of both sides. Of course, there are many good books on the United States Civil War which cover these areas, but just as obviously this book would not be complete without them.One weakness of this history, is that despite Rhodes' claim that this was a fresh study, he does in the very early discussion inform the reader that his discussion of the supporters for disunion was so complete in his three volume history that it is unnecessary to repeat it at length. The result is that one has to wonder how much he is leaving out in this one volume history that was included in his earlier three volume work. Having not read his earlier history, or his larger history of the entire era, it is impossible to judge how much he is leaving out.Along the same lines, his discussion ends fairly abruptly after describing in some detail Lee's surrender, he then briefly mentions the assassination of Lincoln and the surrender of Johnston to Sherman. There is no discussion of the aftermath of the war to balance the discussion of the events leading to the start of the war. These weaknesses are small though when one looks at the overall strength of the book. This one is highly recommended, even after 90+ years.",

It sure packs a lot of information into it, and gives a very good over-view of the civil war. The only peeve I have is that the book is rather centered around the east-south-eastern USA.

            "To me, the dullest part of the Civil War began at Fort Sumter. The greatest deficiency of Ken Burns' celebrated documentary (enough to make it almost useless)is that he spent almost no time on the causes. I have always found the political maneuvering between North and South, between the two great parties(and within them as well), the occasions when secession and war almost happened, and the dramatic compromises that held off disaster to be essential for understanding the war and why it was fought the way it was. The political battles over the Kansas-Nebraska Act and the Lecompton Constitution are more interesting to me than the dramas of Antietam, Chancellorsville or Gettysburg.Avery Craven was one of the so-called &quot;revisionist&quot; school of American historians, those academics who asserted that there was blame for the war on both sides, that condemned radical abolitionists and Southern fire-eaters equally. Although he may not have intended it, Professor Craven makes an even more interesting assertion. There were not two sides in this affair but three. The West(what would now be the Middle West)was a region with its own economic interests. And this region, for the most part, wouldn't have gotten all that worked up about slavery if its farmers could have gotten their goods to market. But Southern political ineptitude and indifference to Western interests alienated that region from the South and probably cost the South the war.All in all, an excellent history of the antebellum United States. Whether you agree with Professor Craven's ideas or not, this book is well worth your time.",
            "I believe it was Avary O. Craven who once said that in depth exploration of the social, political and economic factors which led to the war do not have \"the entertainment value of harrowing tales of runaway slaves.\" He was right of course. Readers will not find any moralizing in this book. That alone will make for a refreshing read. It's not easy reading - but then, understanding the various undercurrents that propelled America to this war isn't an easy thing. But if the reader perseveres, he will emerge with a better understanding of the event, and a realization that the drivel that contemporary historians (for the most part) peddle, is a simplified and dumbed down version of the facts, written, most likely, for a population that has itself been dumbed down.",

I FULLY AGREE. THIS BOOK GIVES A FRESH LIGHT ON THE MOST INTERESTING PERIOD OF AMERICAN HISTORY--THE ANTEBELLUM PERIOD. A GREAT BOOK WELL WORTH READING. sIMPLY LOOK AT THE TABLE OF CONTENTS.",
            "This book is interesting in that it not only examines the key political issues of the antebellum period but also delves into the culture of the time, especially that of South. But the author's views are tilted toward those of the antebellum South. He goes to great length in describing the Southern plantation system with its incorporation of slave labor and compares it somewhat favorably with the industrialization and the \"so-called\" free labor of the North. In addition, the exaggerated Southern claims of social superiority seem to strike a chord with the author.A great deal of the book is consumed with describing the reactions and views of leading spokesmen and of various publications in the North and the South concerning major antebellum political developments. The question of the Mexican Cession and the Wilmot Proviso in 1846 moved the question of slavery squarely into the political system resulting in the formation of the Free Soil Party and talk of secession in the South. The Compromise of 1850 quieted some voices, but only until the next expansion of slavery.Interestingly, of all of the political crises of the mid-1850s where slavery was front and center, that is, the Kansas-Nebraska bill, the bleeding Kansas crisis, and the Dred Scott decision, the author claims that the Southern response was relatively moderate compared to the extremists of the North. Yet that moderation seemed to have evaporated with the John Brown raid at Harpers Ferry. And the Southern reaction to Lincoln's election the next year was beyond shrill and ultimately self-destructive.I think it is fairly obvious that this author regards the Civil War as occurring as a result of emotionalism and opportunism run amok. And despite the fact that the South was unwilling to honor the untainted election of a President and failed to comprehend that all of the conservative candidates together far outpolled the Republican, I believe that the author holds that Northern forces largely provoked the Southern secession and then were unwilling to accept that fact by offering some kind of compromise.This author fails to grasp, or at least state, that slavery and its ramifications were the great moral issues of the day. Of course, tremendous emotionalism was evoked by the issues. And those issues could not be simply managed or downplayed in the Second American Party system. Slavery was conceptually wrong for America and produced an unsustainable divide between two sections of the country. Emotionalism may have obscured that fact then and now, but it is superficial as an explanation for the Civil War."

            "The Civil War was a vastly complex conflict, and there are thousands of specialized texts to be had. This book captures the heart of the tale, and you come away with both the history and the powerful national and human drama. I read this book with a sense that I was there, watching the battles unfold, listening in as the decisions were made that sent men to their triumphs or to their deaths. It is highly readable, but I did not want to rush through it; I periodically put it aside to let my spirit settle.If your knowledge of the Civil War is limited and you think maybe you ought to know more or you'd like to know more, but you don't want to crack open a dry textbook -- then this is the book for you!",
            "The Civil War remains the pivotal and most discussed event in our Nation's history. Every generation of writers and readers feels the need to tell the story of the War anew and to reflect upon its meaning. In the mid-20th Century, the leading interpreter of the Civil War was Bruce Catton (1899-1978). Catton wrote narratives for the nonspecialist reader. He had the ability to make the Civil War era, the battles, and the issues come alive to a broad public. There is still much to be learned from his writing style and from his discussion of the War.Catton's &quot;This Hallowed Ground: the Story of the Union Side of the Civil War&quot; (1956) remains an essential one-volume study of the conflict. Only James McPherson's work, &quot;Battle Cry of Freedom&quot; comes close to matching its scope. While McPherson's work may show a greater degree of scholarship, Catton's work more than compensates in its eloquence and passion.The book begins with the famous caning that Congressman Preston Brooks of South Carolina gave to Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts in 1856 following a Sumner speech against slavery before the Senate. It examines the causes of the War, the battles and politics of the conflict, and concludes with the end of the long conflict in April 1865. (It gives only a brief glance to Reconstruction.)Catton tells the stories of the War's military engagements simply and understandably. I have read detailed accounts of many Civil War battles and tend to become confused. Catton's accounts of the battled are short and, of course, simplified; but they cut to the heart of the matter. I would recommend that anyone interested in studying a battle in depth read Catton's account first, both for an overview of the War and for a basic account of the battle and its place in the scheme of the War.Catton unequivocally states that slavery was the prime cause of the War. I think most contemporary historians agree with him. But many recent writers try to persuade their readers that they are discovering the importance of slavery to the conflict for themselves -- almost for the first time since 1865. It is helpful for an understanding of the history of history to see Catton's recognition (in a popular work written more than a generation ago) of slavery as the driving factor of the War. Catton also writes eloquently about industrialization in North America and about the factors which worked ultimately to make the United States a unified nation. I learned a great deal about the issues leading to the War and about the changes it effected in American life from Catton's account. (In his short discussion of Reconstruction, Catton suggests that the victorious Union took an unduly punitive approach to the South. This is one area in which many contemporary historians, I think, would tend to disagree with him.)Catton's work also places great emphasis on the Western theatre of the War beginning with the capture of Fort Donelson in 1862. He sees Antietam rather than Gettysburg as the Confederate &quot;High Tide&quot; in the conflict. In these matters too, Catton's discussion is in accord with much recent writing on the War.Although Catton's book focuses on, and is deeply sympathetic to, the Northern war effort, he portrays the Confederacy as a valiant and determined foe making its own effort to preserve what it viewed as a traditional, agrarian way of life. Again, he never allows the reader to forget that this way of life was predicated upon slavery. He recognizes the South's persistence in the War, the determination of its people, the courage of its soldiers, and the brilliance of Robert E. Lee without falling into &quot;Lost Cause&quot; mythology.I am pleased that Catton's &quot;This Hallowed Ground&quot; remains in print and available for new readers who wish to understand our country and its greatest conflict. This book is an excellent choice for readers who only wish to read a single work on the War. I enjoyed the comments of the other Amazon readers who have reviewed this book.",
            "Bruce Catton is first and foremost a storyteller. Beyond the actual retelling of the events, which are truly awe-inspiring in their own right, Mr. Catton offers the reader true insight into the stakes of each major battle and the entire as only historical hindsight can offer. The reader will likely gain an appreciation for Lincoln's burden, who seemingly was singly aware amongst the Northern decision makers of the broader consequences of the actions taken to preserve the fledgling union. Mr. Catton does not overly dwell on tactics and casualty numbers, focusing rather on the Civil War amid the context of American culture and history.A note on the tone of the book. This is not a balanced account of the great story, in that there is focus on the Northern side. However, Mr. Catton is delivering no more or less than promised, as the title of the book identifies this intent. That said, this does not mean that he in any way exaggerated the cause or characters in any apparent way. I am not an historian, but am a budding Civil War enthusiast, and have read a couple of the heavyweights: McPherson's &quot;Battlecry of Freedom&quot; and Foote's &quot;The Civil War: a Narrative,&quot; and consider Catton's work superior to both. McPherson's work is a bit more factual, but not as poetic. Foote's 3000+ page work is difficult to read due to his unabashed favoritism to the Confederacy's cause, its heroes, and its battle prowess; even though he is every bit the storyteller and researcher that Catton is. All in all, I would recommend reading both Catton and Foote to achieve a well balanced tutorial of our greatest American story.",
            "This is one of the two or three very best histories of the Civil War ever written. It is on a par with &quot;Battle Cry of Freedom.&quot; It brings events to life. It has the ring of absolute truth. Its characterizations of events and individuals are poetic and deeply moving. It teaches us tremendously important lessons of character and history.In addition, it's a real page-turner - not a hard read at all. I've quoted more sections of it to my wife, my children (ages 11 and 13) and my co-workers than any other book I can think of.I recommend this book to my brothers and sisters who are descendants of Confederate veterans, as well as those of us who are descended from the Union side. It is of a character and stature commensurate with General Lee.Tim Oksman, City AttorneyPortsmouth, Virginia",
            "I read this book twice; once before and again after reading the Grant Trilogy--Capt. Sam Grant, Grant Moves South, and Grant Takes Command followed by The Personal Memoirs of U.S. Grant. The author drew liberally from primary sources, and what he writes you can believe. He writes very well. My first reading was an introduction without knowledge; the second pulled all the other readings together. I recommend them all, of course, but this seems to me a must because it so accurate, complete, and insightful. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",
            "The works of Bruce Catton were among the first that stimulated my interest in the American Civil War. It's a massive subject matter with what must be millions of words written in it's account. Thus reading about the war could be confusing at the least and over powering at the most. This is not the case with Bruce Catton who writes with a clarity that enables the reader to clearly understand the events he is relating.'This Hallowed Ground' is no exception. It is concise, clear and informative, thus the reader whether this is their 1st Civil War read or their 100th will put the book down and want to know more!For a factual book it often had the feel of a good Civil War novel, it is exciting and breath taking with a real power that I feel is hard to match elsewhere. Here is an author that not only both knows and respects his subject matter but is able to transfer this to the written page.One word of warning, read it slowly. If you rush through this book (and there is a temptation to do so due to its strengths) you will regret it when the last page is completed.",
            "I have been a reader of Bruce Catton's Civil War histories for years (I own 10 of them). I agree with the reviewers about Catton's vast talent as a storyteller and as a narrator of events. It was through reading his works that I first became aware of some of the lesser known colorful characters of the time, such as Gen. Phillip Kearney, Gen. D.H. Hill, and Robert Toombs. In fact, it was the writing of Bruce Catton that first turned me into a Civil War buff.I have a rather strong objection to the subtitle of this work, which the late historian would never have approved were he alive today. This book is not \"the Union side\" of the Civil War; it gives BOTH sides. In fact, the author is more sympathetic to men like Gen. Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis than I would have been. For many years, some influential historians have sought to label any history that seems to hint that the right side won the Civil War as biased. (Over four score and seven years, actually.) This work is a balanced account, and one of the best one-volume histories of the war ever written, both on the battle front and at the home fronts. It deserves to be thought of as such.",
            "Of all the heartbreaking, sacrificial, and exhausting wars that the United States has encountered, the Civil War is the most upsetting of all. Bruce Catton, part of the last wave of a generation of romantic historians, paints a vivid portrait of the Union side of the conflict. Like all war historians, he is impressed by the elements that are found in the crucible of a long fight: the pageantry, brilliant tactical moves, feats of individual courage, and the inexhaustible source of stories. But on the other, he has enough judgment to temper his own writing with accounts of casualty lists and useless battles.Catton's main thesis is that although the war did not begin over slavery, it became so through the force of the war's tide, and that the tide only became inexorable after a series of poor decisions on the Union side. He is especially adept at tracing the threads of the various campaigns - the Army of the Potomac's stalemated situation in Virginia, for instance, is contrasted with Grant's quick thinking out west with the Army of the Tennessee. As the title would imply, the book focuses on the to and fro movements of the Union side. Lincoln, Lee, and the particularities of the situation prior to the war are not dealt with in any depth.Nor is this is a book with a list of laundry items for the typical soldier and a slew of footnotes, although it is well-researched and thorough. Catton is more interested in quickly sketching an army as they march through the heat of the Mississippi and the lush countryside of Georgia. He unabashedly plays favorites with his \"cast of characters\" - Grant and Lincoln are praised, McClellan is not - but in most cases his biases are justified.One could argue Catton's taste for drama and humorous anecdote overrides his ability to assess rationally the Civil War, but perhaps his romantic/realistic view of history is more in keeping with the age it is describing. The Civil War was fought by stubborn men who refused to cede a tenet long past its due date - and that in itself is the true tragedy.",
            "There are more books about the American Civil War than on any other subject in US history. New books are written everyday. Some are very good, some are not. However, despite all the new enteries to the field of study in my opinion the best is some of the oldest. In my opinion no one writes better about the Civil War than Bruce Catton. In this work he looks at the Civil War from the Union point of view. But regardless, it is one of the best single volume histories of the war. And despite its age, Catton's works has stood the test of time. His history is good and accurate. And he can write. Catton discusses good history and tells it in beautiful writing. This could be a novel. There are a lot of books on the Civil War, however there are not a lot of writers as good as Catton.",
            "Of the thousand of books written on the American Civil War, &quot;This Hallowed Ground&quot; ranks among the very best, standing side by side with James McPherson's &quot;Battle Cry of Freedom.&quot; Both books not only give a comprehensive history of the war but also place the war in historical context and thoroughly discuss its causes and consequences. In so doing, both books provide an insightful analysis of racism in the mid-nineteenth century and how it is a foundation for racism today. Both those who continue to worship the Confederacy and those who believe the lie that slavery was not the cause of the war will hate these books. Those with open and inquiring minds will love them.",
            "I first read this book almost 40 years ago. With some nervousness, I picked up a copy to read, wondering how well it has held up with the years. Bruce Catton wrote a number of works during his time--from his examination of the Army of the Potomac to his final two volumes of a 3-work biography of U. S. Grant. A number of things stand out about Catton's work. For one, he is an excellent writer. His books move along smoothly and even eloquently. One is captivated by his style. Two, he can, in a few paragraphs, tell us a great deal about the people of the Civil War. Want to get a sense of the crusty veteran general, Charles F. Smith? In a few broad strokes, you get a sense of the man. Three, he provides broader context on the war and its battles, for example, illustrating at one point the difference between the industrial might of the North and the much less advanced industry of the South. A telling commentary on the raw differences between the two sides.This book, then, has something in common with McPherson's splendid \"Battle Cry of Freedom.\" As McPherson, Catton provides a context in which to examine the Civil War. However, even though his description of battles and campaigns tends to be terse, one nonetheless gets a sense of what was at stake and how the battles unfolded. Even with only a few paragraphs on the battle at Wilson's Creek, for instance, one gets a sense of the strange saga of the pugnacious General Lyon's outnumbered army trying to envelope the superior southern forces (the text does not mention that making the odds even longer, Lyon depended on Franz Sigel to carry out the envelopment--a most unfortunate choice).Just so, the discussion of both Gettysburg and Vicksburg is brief but in enough detail to get a sense of the challenges facing both armies at these struggles.Catton unequivocally identifies slavery as a key issue as a part of the cause of the war; he also points out, here and there, how the Union army came slowly to see the evil of slavery, even as they harbored prejudice against slaves.If the reader wants detailed analyses of battles, this book would not serve well. If the reader is interested in a well written historical work that looks at the Civil War and its context, then this book should do nicely. Over a half century since its original publication, this book holds up pretty well--and it is written superbly.",
            "If you're interested in the Civil War enough to browse this book, go ahead and snag it. To get a grasp on this period of our history, you must read Catton. He tells the overall story in the style almost of a novel. He is accurate and factual. Never fear. But this isn't reading history as you might remember. Catton will get your attention, draw you in and help you to feel some of the myriad of emotions that coursed through our ancestors on both sides of this conflict. He made me understand that wherever they trod was indeed hallowed ground after their passing.",
            "This is a book about war, rebellion and freedom. And Bruce Catton weaves these three ideas with great precision in telling this story about our American Civil War. War is about battle and Catton leaves no stone unturned, describing the battles fought and the participants involved with clarity and precision. No significant action in the Eastern or Western theaters of operation is omitted and the reader is left with an understanding of the shifting, near thing with which many of the engagements are fought. From Bull Run in 1861 to the final contest at Five Forks in 1865, Catton works his audience through the campaigns in singular detail.With regard to rebellion, Catton is not one to mince words and defines it in one word: Treason. He points out that the South's most significant error was their complete failure to understand early on, the North's total dedication to Union. \"The South could only win its independence by destroying the government of the United States. As such Southerners were not merely enemies; they were traitors, to be treated as such.\" It would be a long and vicious war whose terms and methods of waging it would be defined by Abraham Lincoln.But it is with regard to freedom that Catton is at the top of his form. He regards the Emancipation Proclamation as the most significant weapon fired during those four long years of war. Declaring slavery extinct in exactly all the areas in which the Federal Government could not enforce the decree, the Emancipation was truly an unusual document. But Lincoln knew its ultimate impact. Emancipation isolated the South. In Catton's words, \"It closed a great door in the face of the southern Confederacy. It locked the Confederacy with the anachronism that was the Confederacy's dreadful, fatal burden.\" Europe could not support slavery. The South was alone with limited manpower, no manufacturing capacity to produce the instruments and material with which to wage war and no friends. The millstone of slavery, that for which it had been fighting, would drag it under.Catton delivers a thoughtful, stirring analysis of the American Civil War. Written in 1956, This Hallowed Ground is totally devoid of rancor, finger pointing, or the revisionism so prevalent in many of the works of its era. Bruce Catton is probably the most prolific writer on this subject; given his superb writing he is also probably the best.",
            "\"This Hallowed Ground\" is famed Civil War historian Bruce Catton's one volume history of that conflict. It captures the great themes of his three volume centennial history in a concise yet complete reading experience.Bruce Catton wrote \"This Hallowed Ground\" in the mid-1950's, prior to the centennial of the Civil War. His scholarship is therefore dated with respect to details revealed by later research, and certainly more recent historians have contributed new and fascinating interpretations of events and participants. However, none save Shelby Foote have approached Catton's literary gifts as a narrative historian of the first order. \"This Hallowed Ground\" reads as tragic human drama on an almost mythic scale. Catton's gift is to provide a coherent narrative of the conflict while locating the stories of very human actors within the larger tragedy. The result brings a long and complicated war into focus for the average reader.Catton came to the study of the Civil War from a career as a journalist, and as one who had known Civil War veterans during his youth in Michigan. Catton had the good journalist's ability to capture a sense of the person, the place, and the event. \"This Hallowed Ground\" is told as a series of rather vivid vignettes, each capturing a key moment in the war. The reader comes to understand how the force of events quickly overran the intentions of both sides at the start of the conflict. Key persons, themselves often driven by political considerations of the moment, changed the direction of events, sometimes inadvertantly. The major personalities, Lincoln, Jefferson Davis, Grant, and Lee march across the stage, but a host of lesser characters have their moments as the war winds down to its awful and perhaps unavoidable conclusion.This book is highly recommended to the reader looking for a highly readable one volume history of the Civil War, and to students of the conflict looking for an account that transcends dry scholarship.",
            "Bruce Catton is one of the best history writers of the Civil War. He writes in a fashion that is easy to read yet leaves no doubt what he is saying. Very good way to enjoy history. It is almost like reading a novel.",
            "(For a complete, formatted review, please visit [...]There are not enough superlatives to do justice to this book. I read it as a teenager and bought it in a Washington bookstore for my son but ended up reading it again myself. As many reviewers have noted, if you read only one book about the Civil War, read this. Bruce Catton has a lyrical poetic style that weaves colorful anecdotes with sweeping prose that makes about as much sense as anyone can of the horror of America's bloodiest war by far.First published in 1955, before the civil rights movement entered into the consciousness of most educated Americans, This Hallowed Ground was remarkably prescient, referring repeatedly to the painful issue not just of slavery but of race and of the inevitable reckoning that would have to come if the \"peculiar institution\" were abolished once and for all. Eight years before Martin Luther King was to deliver his \"I Have a Dream Speech,\" Catton could see that almost a century after the Civil War, the United States remained a work in progress.Catton avoids the pitfalls that trap many historians, such as a compulsion for detail that misses the forest for the trees, or a contemporary interpretation whose bias makes later readers wince. When Catton drills down to a battlefield, he gives just enough detail to create a vivid word picture but is adept at zooming out and showing us how the battlefield fits in the campaign, and the campaign in the war, and the war in the history of America. Long before Ken Burns' PBS Civil War series had been conceived (Burns was only 2 when the book was published), Catton peppered his narrative with extracts from letters and diaries of the ordinary men who had a front row seat to this extraordinary history.Perhaps because of all the shouting going on in American politics today about what it means to be an American and the proper scope and power of the federal government, there was something eerily contemporary about the book's opening. Following arrests made in Baltimore, \"when Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney issued a writ of habeas corpus to set one of these free, President Lincoln blandly ignored it... The Supreme Court had indeed been flouted, the Constitution had been stretched, perhaps even broken (depending on one's point of view), scores of people were being held in prison without due process of law... No matter. Maryland was not going to go out of the Union.\" And I could not help think of today's political attack ads when reading that \"men who were whipping themselves up to the point where they would refuse to try to get along with one another were, at the same point in time, doing precisely the things that would bind them together forever whether they liked it or not. \" But for all the harsh words, today's acrimony has not spilled over into violence, as it did on the senate floor in the opening scene of the book with the 1856 caning of Senator Charles Sumner. But the compulsion of demonizing one's adversaries remains: \"All of the things that were slipping beyond hope of easy solution - ... varying interpretations of the American dream - all of these somehow might hinge on what was done about Kansas, so that the wrong phrase in an enacting clause could mean earth's best hope lost forever.\"If Catton's work had been fiction, it would have been rejected for lack of plausibility. Given the carnage of the war that was to come, why would volunteers be so eager to fight that \"soldiers sent home in Indiana threatened to shoot their colonel\"?How could it possibly be that the house chosen to host the surrender that would end this terrible war would be that of Wilmer McLean, a Virginian who found his Bull Run home too caught up in the war's opening battle, so moved to Appomattox? Who knew that Grant not only owned a slave at one point but didn't care all that much about slavery one way or the other until about 1861? Or that the two generals most instrumental to ending the war were both from Ohio and overlapped at West Point (Grant was a senior when Sherman was a plebe)? Or that on the very morning that Sherman was to accept the surrender of General Johnston he received a telegram telling him of Lincoln's murder? And the contrast between General Lee - \"tall, gray, one of the handsomest and most imposing man who ever lived, dressed today in his best uniform, his sword belted at his waist\" and the man who received his surrender \"US Grant, rather scrubby and undersized, wearing his work in close, with mud spattered boots and trousers and a private's rumpled coat with his lieutenant general stars tacked to the shoulders\" at a surrender ceremony where Grant had to borrow ink from the Lee and Lee had to borrow paper reflected staging too perfect for a good fiction editor.His writing pulls you in and keeps you riveted such as with this description of Antietam:There never was another day like Antietam. It was sheer concentrated violence... it had all of the insane fury of Shiloh with this difference: at Shiloh the troops were green ... at Antietam the men were veterans and they knew what they were about... so that the dawn to dusk fight above Antietam creek went into the records as the most murderous single day of the entire war.Sherman's march to the sea is described in a way that rivals the far more biased and regional fiction of Margaret Mitchell: \"Smoke filled the sky like a gigantic ominous signal as Sherman's army pulled clear of the city [of Atlanta] and started for the sea... And so began the strangest, most fateful campaign of the entire war, like nothing that happened before or afterward. These federals were not moving out to find and destroy an armed enemy; the only foe that could give them a fight, Hood's army, was hundreds of miles off to the rear, and everybody knew it. They were not being asked to hurry; 15 miles a day was much less than these long legged marchers could easily make, and everybody knew that too. Their mission was to wreck an economy and to destroy a faith - the economy that supported the thin fading fabric of the Confederacy, the faith that believed the Confederacy to be an enduring creation and trusted in its power to protect and avenge.\" The men were \"conscious agents of this destruction; men who trampled out the terrible vintage of the grapes of wrath, led by an implacable general who was more and more coming to see a monstrous but logical destiny in his mission... For Sherman was not fighting and opposing army now; he was fighting an idea, knocking down the last shredded notion that the Southern Confederacy could exist as an independent nation, moving steadily and relentlessly not toward a climactic engagement but simply toward the end of the war.\"The final days and aftermath of the Civil War are such well-trodden ground that it is surprising that no author before or since has really topped Catton's riveting description of the end:Until this Palm Sunday of 1865 the word Appomattox had no meaning. It was a harsh name left over from Indian days, it belonged to a river and to a country town, and it had no overtones. But after this day, it would be one of the haunted possessions of the American people, a great and unique word that would echo in the national memory with infinite tragedy and infinite promise, recalling a moment in which sunset and sunrise came together in a street glow that was half twilight and half dawn.Like a brilliant movie director, Catton pans his camera over the horrific cost and inevitable consequences of the Civil War in ways that make historical abstractions come alive:Here and there all over the country where the mounded graves of half a million young men who had been alive and unsuspecting when all of this began. There would be more graves to dig, and when there was time there would be thin bugle calls to lie in the still air on a handful of dust drifted down on a blanketed form, but most of this was over. A little more killing, a little more marching and burning and breaking and smashing, and then it would be ended.Ended; yet, in a haunting way, forever unended. It had laid an infinity of loss and grief on the land; it had created a shadowed purple twilight streaked with undying fire which would live on deep in the mind and heart of the nation, as long as any memory of the past retained meaning. Whatever the American people might hereafter do when one way or another take form in color from this experience.If Catton can be faulted, it is for a certain tendency to repeat but his prose is so lyrical, almost hypnotic, that he can be forgiven. He also shares the compulsion of all historians to assign meaning to events, even if some things, perhaps most things, just happen. Historians probably would not be historians if they did not discount the role of randomness, meaningless, and blind chance. But I find myself so mesmerized by Catton's authoritative writing - at times he seems to have known the protagonists personally - that I find myself wanting to believe his sweeping, all-explanatory narrative.",
            "When I was a freshman in college, way back in 1986 I happened upon a Bruce Catton (1899-1978) book in the bookstore while buying all of my textbooks for my first semester. I picked it up just because I was in a mood to be educated with something that looked more interesting and less daunting than my economics and math textbooks. My fascination with all things Civil War began with that book (I sold it in a fit of stupidity a couple of years later). I read his trilogy, re-printed articles in American Heritage and then I moved on to other talented authors, such as James McPherson.Rather stupidly, I forgot how truly gifted Catton was as a writer and I just assumed that because Catton was the historian of my childhood, he was an inferior writer. Why? I don't know. I picked up this This Hallowed Ground: The Story of the Union Side of the Civil War to read on a family vacation and I was reminded, once again, that this man could truly write and he belongs right there in the pantheon of truly gifted storytellers who can tell the story of America in an entertaining, factual and compelling way (for those that scoff at narrative history in favor of \"serious history\" I say that the purpose of a historian is to tell his society their own story and make it seem that it matters. Bruce Catton did just that.)Catton begins with a single week in May of 1856. We have the beating of abolitionist Senator Charles Sumner by a pro-slavery Congressman in the Senate Chamber, the sacking of Lawrence, Kansas by pro-slavery forces and John Brown's brutal attack at Pottawatomie Creek. All within a few days of each other - all portents of things to come. One thing seemed to unhinge everyone in America - slavery and the disagreement over a state's right to declare a man to be another man's property.Catton does tell the story almost completely from the Union perspective and it is clear that he is sympathetic to the Union cause in this book. He is not the only author of Civil War histories to have favorites, but he is clearly not disrespectful of the Confederate soldiers or of their efforts. He is also leery of some of the liberties Lincoln took in his effort to maintain the Union, as is clear in the section on Clement Vallandigham.Mostly, though, Catton's strength is just his storytelling. It moves along crisply with a penchant for telling the odd, humorous and tragic little stories that make up the overall big story. Along the way, Catton produces some profound little gems, like this paragraph about 1864 the slow, bloody demise of slavery and what that meant for the country that concluded a chapter:\"It would be that sort of year: year of Jubilo, year of overturn and disaster and ruin, year infinite bloodshed and suffering, with the foundations of the great deep broken up; hard tramp of marching military feet, endless shuffle of splay-footed refugees running from something they understood little better than they could understand what they were running toward; the significance of their march being that it led toward the unknown and that all America, like it or not, was going to follow.\"To sum up, this is a lovely little history - beautifully written, skillfully told by a master storyteller. It is not the only history that someone should read of the Civil War, but it is a great place to start. Also, I am thrilled that I went back and re-discovered Bruce Catton and found that he is not only as good as I remembered - he is better.Highly recommended.",
            "I have an extensive Civil War library, and this is simply the best of the best book therein. It is a one volume offering from the Union point of view, although it clearly defines both sides. Catton's style is simply amazing. Although history at its best, this reads like classic literature. The concluding scenes described by Catton practically bring tears to your eyes.Be aware that this book is out of print. This is why I bought several more copies at Amazon.",
            "Catton has masterfully crafted a well researched very readable book. It explores much more than troop placements by putting a very human face on the greatest of American tragedies.",
            "I was half way through the first volume of Foote's epic 3 volume \"The Civil War: a narrative\" when I paused for a breather and read Catton's Hallowed Ground.So, compared to Foote's 3 volume The Civil War, Catton's Hallowed Ground provides a good overview of all the major battles in the Civil War. He had also included quotes from letters soldiers had written to family which I thought was a nice touch as it provided a different view of the civil war and illustrated how tough things were for them. What I also liked about Catton is that he had referenced the quotes and pointed to other books if you were interested in that particular regiment or battle.For someone new to the civil war, I would definitely recommend reading Catton's Hallowed Ground first then refer to Foote for more detailed description of the more interesting battles. However, as another reviewer here points out, there is a hint of bias in favour of the confederacy in Foote.",
            "The premiere work from the War Between the States' best author. I've read nearly all of Bruce Catton's Civil War work and this one is the best--buy it and read it again and again.",
            "If you are one who has never read a book about the Civil War, or studied it since you were in high school, you could do much worse than to start with Bruce Catton's \"This Hallowed Ground.\" Mr. Catton, who passed away in 1978, has long been hailed as one of the best, if not the very best, Civil War writer ever to create a manuscript. Recently, when I mentioned to a friend during a conversation about the kind of books we prefer, that I read a lot about the American Civil War, she sort of made a sour face and began praising the virtues of Romance novels. Now, there are history books, even books about the Civil War that warrant a sour face, but the books written by Bruce Catton are not among them. His narrative, his prose, his whole writing style is sometimes enough to bring tears to the eyes or take the breath away. Here, I quote a paragraph from a chapter titled \"Where They Were Bound to Go,\" in the book that is the subject of this review.\"The wind was being sown, and the hurricane would come later; and yet, all in all, these things were not so much causes as warnings - the lightning flashes that set evil scarlet flares against the black clouds that were banked up along the horizon. Somewhere beyond the lightning there was thunder, and the making of a great wind that would change the face of a nation, destroying much that men did not want destroyed. A doom was taking shape, and it seemed to be coming on relentlessly, as if there was nothing that anyone could do to prevent it. The republic that had been born in an air so full of promise that it might have been the morning of the seventh day was getting ready to tear itself apart.\"In this manner Mr. Catton sets the scene for the war that took the lives of 620,000 Americans, tore families apart, and put some teeth in the statement that \"All men are created equal.\" As has been noted in other reviews here, Catton was top-heavy on the side of the North, and why not? He was a Michigan boy, and no one would expect a Michigan boy to lionize the South any more than they would expect a fellow from Georgia to shun Stonewall Jackson and glorify Tecumseh Sherman! Yet there is, wrapped up in all of the words in this book that seem to revere the Union cause, in the dramatic and often dynamic prose of a great writer, a recognizable thread of fairness, and deep admiration for the courage and valor of the Southern soldier.This Hallowed Ground is an excellent place to start any study of the Civil War, or even to engage in some casual reading. Bruce Catton begins before the beginning, and carries it through to the end, leaving out much of the battle strategy and tactics, and appealing to the heart of every American who, as he says on page 25 of the paperback edition: \"......what they saw, briefly but clearly, after so many years in which nothing was clear - was the fact that they did have a country and that their common possession of it was the most precious thing in the world.\" It may be that what Americans saw so clearly all those years ago, is the only way to understand the \"why\" of the war that changed the soul of this great nation. At least, I think that may be so.",

            "This, I think, is the best of the books I ever read about the Civil War.Very detailed but easy to undestand the background of the events that had hapened.For a reader like me, who has certain level of knowledge but not complete, about this war between Americans, and have experience to live in various cities and areas in both Northern and Southern territories (of that time),it is very interesting and exciting to know each area's strategic importance for both North and South.I started reading American history from asassinations of Kennedy and Lncoln to Civil War and then to discoveries of North and South Americas by European great explorers. Thus, I expect to deepen my understanding of American history all the way through to General Washington and his time of American Independence .So far ,all my readings are continuously flowing in my two Kindle and Kindle HD fire,tools indispensable for me . Thanks Amazon and IT developments, which are wondefull.",
            "I really enjoyed this book and it was a quick read. I would have given the book 5 stars but at times I thought is was too concise and other times too detailed. I would recommend to others.",
            "James Ford Rhodes (May 1st, 1848 - January 22nd, 1927) was both an industrialist and an historian. Prior to this work, he produced seven volumes of a \"History of the United States from the Compromise of 1850\" (an eighth volume was published after this work), and he also produced a three volume \"History of the Civil War 1861-1865\". In the preface to this one-volume \"History of the Civil War 1861-1865\" he states that this is not an \"abridgement\" of his prior work, but rather was a \"fresh\" study.Originally published by \"The MacMillan Company\" in 1917, this new History was awarded the 2nd Pulitzer Prize for History in 1918. Rhodes became known for his detailed research and lack of bias which is consistent throughout all his history works. His balanced treatment of both sides is a rather stark contrast to the first winner of the Pulitzer Prize in History (Jean Jules Jusserand's \"With Americans of Past and Present Days\") which was more of a celebration of Franco-American relations.It is interesting while reading this book to think about the way the perceptions of the United States Civil War have changed over the years. As an example, Rhodes has no difficulty in emphasizing slavery and anti-slavery as the primary causes of the war, and since that time it has become more common to see more general references to state rights used, perhaps to cover the ugliness of issue. Another example would be the way History and Historians treat Robert E. Lee. Rhodes has high praise for Lee, though that is not to say that he doesn't point out his mistakes. Lee does not seem to fare so well with modern historians.The discussion of other nation's attitudes towards the war is one of the more interesting sections, at least for me. Though ultimately there was no foreign interference, it is interesting to learn how a different outcome in a battle here and there, could easily have changed things considerably. One also gets a slightly different view on the French position towards the Union than one did from the essay from Jusserand's work, though to be fair the prior work was more focused on their attitude towards slavery and Abraham Lincoln, and not as much on the war and its negative effects on France.Other interesting chapters and threads throughout the book include looking at how the North responded to the draft, especially after it became clear that the war would be won. There is a discussion of the politics and the Democratic Party turning into the Copperheads, while some legitimate opposition positions were lost as a result of the party pushing their opposition to Lincoln and the war. Rhodes also discusses the technology, and the failure to quickly move to breech loading rifles.His discussion of the economics during the war is also very thorough. Obviously there is a discussion on the blockades and blockade running. In addition he discusses the currency problems faced both in North and South, as well as the debt resulting from the war and the consequences to the populations of the Union and the Confederacy. He also looks at the illegal trade between North and South during the war.Not surprisingly, Rhodes gives an excellent and thorough evaluation of the Generals and other figures on each side of the war. In particular, his comparison of the Generals as they come into opposition with each other is particularly well done. While the perception of some of them as changed through time, one can count on an even appraisal in all cases. The same is true for his evaluation of the battles, tactics, and strategies from the perspective of both sides. Of course, there are many good books on the United States Civil War which cover these areas, but just as obviously this book would not be complete without them.One weakness of this history, is that despite Rhodes' claim that this was a fresh study, he does in the very early discussion inform the reader that his discussion of the supporters for disunion was so complete in his three volume history that it is unnecessary to repeat it at length. The result is that one has to wonder how much he is leaving out in this one volume history that was included in his earlier three volume work. Having not read his earlier history, or his larger history of the entire era, it is impossible to judge how much he is leaving out.Along the same lines, his discussion ends fairly abruptly after describing in some detail Lee's surrender, he then briefly mentions the assassination of Lincoln and the surrender of Johnston to Sherman. There is no discussion of the aftermath of the war to balance the discussion of the events leading to the start of the war. These weaknesses are small though when one looks at the overall strength of the book. This one is highly recommended, even after 90+ years.",
            "Purchasers of this classic civil war history need to be aware that the original Macmillan hardcover editions contain 8 full-color, fold-out maps, that you will not likely find in such marvelous form in the print-on-demand paperback reproductions. The original maps are one of the real treasures of this title and so any editions without them would, I'm sorry to say, be considered woefully inferior.",
            "I was afraid I'd be bored by attempting to read up on the Civil war, even though as a foreigner here, I wanted to learn about american history. Turns out, this book is extremely engrossing; I could not put it down once I took it up, and I don't remember any part being boring such that I wanted to skip over them. As for the accuracy of information presented, I cannot tell but trust the various reviews that I've found on different sources that this is a good book. It sure packs a lot of information into it, and gives a very good over-view of the civil war. The only peeve I have is that the book is rather centered around the east-south-eastern USA. There isn't much mention of what was going on in the north (especially wisconsin where I live where the civil war was very alive) nor the west (there's a few mentions here and there about the west.) Yet I don't know if one can find a better introductory book than this on the civil war.",

            "Very interesting. This is a great book for history buffs. I'd suggest downloading this book if you enjoy history. This one is great on the fire.",
            "This book was very good as it included many behind the scene goings on that I never knew. Learned many new things especially about behind the scene political like with the Countries in Europe. Over all, very good on the Civil War.",
            "The book is well written and has been very worth while to read. Unfortunately I seem to be missing the illustrations which I presume is a part of the book, I am therefore not able to evaluate the entirely.RegardsKim Mller Petersen",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I am a history buff and have tried to read as much as I can.",
            "Rhodes covers the war in a very succinct, no nonsense manner. Writing style is somewhat dated, but completely understandable. It's advertised as being illustrated, but there are fewer pictures than I would have liked. Still, it's a good bargain for the amateur historian that wants a refresher on the Civil War.",
